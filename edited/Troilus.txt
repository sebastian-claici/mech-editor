The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen
That was the kyng Priamus sone of Troye
In louynge how his auentures fellen
ffro wo to wele and after out of ioie
My purpos is er that I parte fro ye
Thesiphone thow help me for tendite
Thise woful vers that wepen as I write  
To the clepe I thow goddesse of torment
Thow cruwel furie sorwynge euere in peyne
Help me that am the sorwful instrument
That helpeth loueres as I kan to pleyne
ffor wel sit it the sothe for to seyne
A woful wight to han a drery feere
And to a sorwful tale a sory chere  
ffor I that god of loues seruantz serue
Ne dar to loue for myn vnliklynesse
Preyen for speed al sholde I therfore sterue
So fer am I from his help in derknesse
But natheles if this may don gladnesse
To any louere and his cause auaille
Haue he my thonk and myn be this trauaille   
But ȝe loueres that bathen in gladnesse
If any drope of pyte in ȝow be
Remembreth ȝow on passed heuynesse
That ȝe han felt and on the aduersite
Of othere folk and thynketh how that ȝe
Han felt that loue dorste ȝow displese
Or ȝe han wonne hym with to grete an ese  
And preieth for hem that ben in the cas
Of Troilus as ȝe may after here
That loue hem brynge in heuene to solas
And ek for me preieth to god so dere
That I haue myght to shewe in som manere
Swich peyne and wo as loues folk endure
In Troilus vnsely auenture  
And biddeth ek for hem that ben despeired
In loue that neuere nyl recouered be
And ek for hem that falsly ben apeired
Thorugh wikked tonges be it he or she
Thus biddeth god for his benignite
So graunte hem soone owt of this world to pace
That ben despeired out of loues grace  
And biddeth ek for hem that ben at ese
That god hem graunte ay good perseueraunce
And send hem myght hire ladies so to plese
That it to loue be worship and plesaunce
ffor so hope I my sowle best auaunce
To prey for hem that loues seruauntz be
And write hire wo and lyue in charite  
And for to haue of hem compassioun
As though I were hire owne brother dere
Now herkneth with a good entencioun
ffor now wil I gon streght to my matere
In which ȝe may the double sorwes here
Of Troilus in louynge of Criseyde
And how that she forsook hym er she deyde   
Yt is wel wist how that the Grekes stronge
In armes with a thousand shippes wente
To Troiewardes and the cite longe
Assegeden neigh ten ȝer er they stente
And in diuerse wise and oon entente
The rauysshyng to wreken of Eleyne
By Paris don they wroughten al hir peyne  
Now fel it so that in the town ther was
Dwellynge a lord of gret auctorite
A gret deuyn that clepid was Calkas
That in science so expert was that he
Knew wel that Troie sholde destroied be
By answere of his god that highte thus
Daun Phebus or Appollo Delphicus  
So whan this Calkas knew by calkulynge
And ek by answer of this Appollo
That Grekes sholden swich a peple brynge
Thorugh which that Troie moste ben fordo
He  caste anon out of the town to go
ffor wel wiste he by sort that Troye sholde
Destroyed ben  ȝe wolde whoso nolde  
ffor which forto departen softely
Took purpos ful this forknowynge wise
And to the Grekes oost ful pryuely
He stal anon and they in curteys wise
Hym diden bothe worship and seruyce
In trust that he hath konnynge hem to rede
In euery peril which that is to drede   
The noise vp ros whan it was first aspied
Thorugh al the town and generaly was spoken
That Calkas traitour fled was and allied
With hem of Grece and casten to be wroken
On hym that falsly hadde his feith so broken
And seyden he and al his kyn atones
Ben worthi for to brennen felle and bones  
Now hadde Calkas left in this meschaunce
Al vnwist of this false and wikked dede
His doughter which that was in gret penaunce
ffor of hire lif she was ful sore in drede
As she that nyste what was best to rede
ffor bothe a widewe was she and allone
Of any frend to whom she dorste hir mone  
Criseyde was this lady name al right 
As to my doom in al Troies cite
Nas non so fair for passynge euery wight
So aungelik was hir natif beaute
That lik a thing inmortal semed she
As doth an heuenyssh perfit creature
That down were sent in scornynge of nature   
This lady which that alday herd at ere
Hire fadres shame his falsnesse and tresoun
Wel neigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere
In widewes habet large of samyt broun
On knees she fil biforn Ector adown
With pitous vois and tendrely wepynge
His mercy bad hir seluen excusynge  
Now was this Ector pitous of nature
And saugh that she was sorwfully bigon
And that she was so faire a creature
Of his goodnesse he gladede hire anon
And seyde lat ȝoure fadres treson gon
fforth with meschaunce and ȝe ȝoure self in ioie
Dwelleth with vs whil ȝow good list in Troie  
And al thonour that men may don ȝow haue
As ferforth as ȝoure fader dwelled here
Ȝe shul haue and ȝoure body shal men saue
As fer as I may ought enquere or here
And she hym thonked with ful humble chere
And ofter wolde and it hadde ben his wille
And took hire leue and hom and held hir stille  
And in hire hous she abood with swich meyne
As til hire honour nede was to holde
And whil she was dwellynge in that cite
Kepte hir estat and both of ȝonge and olde
fful wel biloued and wel men of hir tolde 
But wheither that she children hadde or noon
I rede it naught therfore I late it goon  
The thynges fellen as they don of werre
Bitwixen hem of Troie and Grekes ofte
ffor som day boughten they of Troie it derre
And eft the Grekes founden no thing softe
The folk of Troie and thus fortune on lofte
And vnder eft gan hem to whielen bothe
Aftir hir cours ay whil that thei were wrothe   
But how this town com to destruccion
Ne falleth naught to purpos me to telle
ffor it were here a long digression
ffro my matere and ȝow to long to dwelle
But the Troian gestes as they felle
In Omer or in Dares or in Dite
Whoso that kan may rede hem as they write  
But though that Grekes hem of Troie shetten
And hir cite biseged al aboute
Hire olde vsage nolde they nat letten
As for to honour hir goddes ful deuoute
But aldirmost in honour out of doute
Thei hadde a relik heet Palladion
That was hire trist abouen euerichon  
And so bifel whan comen was the tyme
Of Aperil whan clothed is the mede
With newe grene of lusty Veer the pryme
And swote smellen floures white and rede
In sondry wises shewed as I rede
The folk of Troie hire obseruaunces olde
Palladiones feste forto holde  
And to the temple in al hir beste wise
In general ther wente many a wight
To herknen of Palladion the seruyce
And namely so many a lusty knyght
So many a lady fressh and mayden bright
fful wel arayed both moeste mene and leste
Ȝe bothe for the seson and the feste   
Among thise othere folk was Criseyda
In widewes habit blak but natheles
Right as oure firste lettre is now an A
In beaute first so stood she makeles
Hire goodly lokyng gladed al the prees
Nas neuere ȝet seyn thyng to ben preysed derre
Nor vnder cloude blak so bright a sterre  
As was Criseyde as folk seyde euerichone
That hir behelden in hir blake wede
And ȝet she stood ful lowe and stille allone
Byhynden other folk in litel brede
And nei ȝ the dore ay vndre shames drede
Simple of atire and debonaire of chere
With ful assured lokyng and manere  
This Troilus as he was wont to gide
His ȝonge knyghtes lad hem vp and down
In thilke large temple on euery side
Byholding ay the ladies of the town
Now here now there for no deuocioun
Hadde he to non to reuen hym his reste
But gan to preise and lakken whom hym leste  
And in his walk ful faste he gan to wayten
If knyght or squyer of his compaignie
Gan forto syke or lete his eighen baiten
On any womman that he koude espye
He wolde smyle and holden it folye
And seye hym thus god woot she slepeth softe
ffor loue of the whan thow turnest ful ofte   
I haue herd told perdieux of ȝoure lyuynge
Ȝe loueres and ȝoure lewed obseruaunces
And which a labour folk han in wynnynge
Of loue and in the kepyng which doutaunces
And whan ȝoure prey is lost woo and penaunces
O veray fooles nyce and blynde be ȝe
Ther nys nat oon kan war by other be  
And with that word he gan caste vp the browe
Ascaunces loo is this naught wisely spoken
At which the god of loue gan loken rowe
Right for despit and shop forto ben wroken
He kidde anon his bowe nas naught broken
ffor sodeynly he hitte hym atte fulle
And ȝet as proude a pekok kan he pulle  
O blynde world O blynde entencioun
How often falleth al the effect contraire
Of surquidrie and foul presumpcioun
ffor kaught is proud and kau ȝt is debonaire
This Troilus is clomben on the staire
And litel weneth that he moot descenden 
But alday faileth thing that fooles wenden   
As proude Bayard gynneth forto skippe
Out of the weye so pryketh him his corn
Til he a lasshe haue of the longe whippe
Than thynketh he though I praunce al byforn
ffirst in the trays ful fat and newe shorn
Ȝet am I but an hors and horses lawe
I moot endure and with my feres drawe  
So ferde it by this fierse and proude knyght
Though he a worthy kynges sone were
And wende no thing hadde had swich myght
A ȝeyns his wille that shuld his herte stere
Ȝet with a look his herte wax afere
That he that now was moost in pride aboue
Wax sodeynly moost subgit vnto loue  
fforthy ensample taketh of this man
Ȝe wise proude and worthi folkes alle
To scornen loue which that so soone kan
The fredom of ȝoure hertes to him thralle 
ffor euere it was and euere it shal byfalle
That loue is he that alle thing may bynde
ffor may no man fordon the lawe of kynde  
That this be soth hath preued and doth ȝit
ffor this trowe I ȝe knowen alle or some
Men reden nat that folk han gretter wit
Than they that han be most with loue ynome
And strengest folk bien therwith ouerecome
The worthiest and grettest of degree 
This was and is and ȝet men shall it see   
And trewelich it sit wel to be so
ffor alderwisest han therwith ben plesed
And they that han ben aldermost in wo
With loue han ben comforted moost and esed
And ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed
And worthi folk maad worthier of name
And causeth moost to dreden vice and shame  
Now sith it may nat goodly ben withstonde
And is a thing so vertuouse in kynde
Refuseth nat to loue forto ben bonde
Syn as hym seluen liste he may ȝow bynde
The ȝerde is bet that bowen wole and wynde
Than that that brest and therfore I ȝow rede
To folowen hym that so wel kan ȝow lede  
But forto tellen forth in special
As of this kynges sone of which I tolde
And leten other thing collateral
Of hym thenke I my tale forth to holde
Both of his ioie and of his cares colde
And al his werk as touching this matere
ffor I it gan I wol therto refere  
Withinne the temple he wente hym forth pleyinge
This Troilus of euery wight aboute
On this lady and now on that lokynge
Where so she were of town or of withoute
And vpon cas bifel that thorugh a route
His eye percede and so depe it wente
Til on Criseyde it smote and ther it stente   
And sodeynly he wax therwith astoned
And gan hir bet biholde in thrifty wise
O mercy god thoughte he wher hastow woned
That art so feyre and goodly to deuise
Therwith his herte gan to sprede and rise
And softe sighed lest men myghte hym here
And cau ȝt a ȝeyn his firste pleyinge chere  
She nas nat with the leste of hire statore
But alle hir lymes so wel answerynge
Weren to wommanhode that creature
Was neuere lasse mannyssh in semynge
And ek the pure wise of hire meuynge
Shewed wel that men myght in hire gesse
Honour estat and wommanly noblesse  
To Troilus right wonder wel with alle
Gan forto like hire meuynge and hire chere
Which somdel deignous was for she let falle
Hire look a lite aside in swich manere
Ascaunces what may I nat stonden here
And after that hir lokynge gan she lighte
That neuere thoughte hym seen so good a syghte  
And of hire look in him ther gan to quyken
So gret desire and swich affeccioun
That in his hertes botme gan to stiken
Of hir his fixe and depe impressioun
And though he erst hadde poured vp and down
He was tho glad his hornes into shrinke
Unnethes wiste he how to loke or wynke   
Lo he that leet hym seluen so konnynge
And scorned hem that loues peynes dryen
Was ful vnwar that loue hadde his dwellynge
Withinne the subtile stremes of hire eyen
That sodeynly hym thoughte he felte deyen
Right with hire look the spirit in his herte 
Blissed be loue that kan thus folk conuerte  
She this in blak likynge to Troilus
Ouer al thing he stood forto biholde
Ne his desire ne wherfore he stood thus
He neither chere made ne worde tolde
But from afer his manere forto holde
On other thing his look som tyme he caste
And efte on hire while that the seruyse laste  
And after this nat fullich al awhaped
Out of the temple al esilich he wente
Repentynge hym that he hadde euere iiaped
Of loues folk lest fully the descente
Of scorn fille on hym self but what he mente
Lest it were wist on any manere syde
His woo he gan dissimilen and hide  
Whan he was fro the temple thus departed
He streght anon vnto his paleys torneth
Hight with hire look thorughshoten and thorughdarted
Al feyneth he in lust that he soiourneth
And al his chere and speche also he borneth
And ay of loues seruantz euery while
Hym self to wrey at hem he gan to smyle   
And seyde lord so ȝe lyue al in lest
Ȝe loueres for the konnyngeste of ȝow
That serueth most ententiflich and best
Hym tit as often harm therof as prow
Ȝoure hire is quyt a ȝeyn ȝe god woot how
Nought wel for wel but scorn for good seruyse
In feith ȝoure ordre is ruled in good wise  
In nouncerteyn ben alle ȝoure obseruaunces
But it a sely fewe pointes be
Ne no thing asketh so gret attendaunces
As doth ȝoure lay and that knowe alle ȝe
But that is nat the worste as mote I the
But tolde I ȝow the worste point I leue
Al seyde I soth ȝe wolden at me greue  
But take this that ȝe loueres ofte eschuwe
Or elles doon of good entencioun
fful ofte thi lady wol it mysconstruwe
And deme it harm in hire oppynyoun
And ȝet if she for other enchesoun
Be wroth than shaltow haue a groyne anon 
Lord wel is hym that may of ȝow ben oon  
But for al this whan that he say his tyme
He held his pees non other boote hym gayned
ffor loue bigan his fetheres so to lyme
That wel vnneth vntil his folk he fayned
That other besy nedes hym destrayned
ffor wo was hym that what to doon he nyste
But bad his folk to gon wher that hem liste  
And whan that he in chambre was allone
He doun vpon his beddes feet hym sette
And first he gan to sike and eft to grone
And thought ay on hire so withouten lette
That as he sat and wook his spirit mette
That he hire sauȝ and temple and al the wise
Right of hire look and gan it newe avise  
Thus gan he make a mirour of his mynde
In which he saugh al holly hire figure
And that he wel koude in his herte fynde
It was to hym a right good auenture
To loue swich oon and if he dede his cure
To seruen hir ȝet myghte he falle in grace
Or ellis for oon of hire seruantes pace   
Imagenynge that trauaille nor grame
Ne myghte for so goodly oon be lorn
As she ne hym for his desire no shame
Al were it wist but in pris and vp born
Of alle louers wel more than biforn 
Thus argumented he in his gynnynge
fful vnauysed of his woo comynge  
Thus took he purpos loues craft to suwe
And thoughte he wolde werken pryuely
ffirst to hiden his desire in muwe
ffrom euery wight yborn al outrely
But he myghte ought recouered be therby
Remembryng hym that loue to wide yblowe
Ȝelt bittre fruyt though swete seed be sowe  
And ouere al this ȝet muchel more he thoughte
What forto speke and what to holden inne
And what to arten hire to loue he soughte
And on a song anon right to bygynne
And gan loude on his sorwe forto wynne
ffor with good hope he gan fully assente
Criseyde forto loue and nought repente  
And of his song naught only the sentence
As writ myn auctour called Lollius
But pleinly saue oure tonges difference
I dar wel seyn in al that Troilus
Seyde in his song loo euery word right thus
As I shal seyn and whoso list it here
Loo next this vers he may it fynden here
If no loue is O god what fele I so
And if loue is what thing and which is he
If loue be good from whennes cometh my woo
If it be wikke a wonder thynketh me
Whenne euery torment and aduersite
That cometh of hym may to me sauory thinke
ffor ay thurst I the more that ich it drynke
And if that at myn owen lust I brenne
ffrom whennes cometh may waillynge and my pleynte
If harme agree me wherto pleyne I thenne
I noot ne whi vnwery that I feynte
O quike deth O swete harm so queynte
How may of the in me swich quantite
But if that I consente that it be  
And if that I consente I wrongfully
Compleyne iwis thus possed to and fro
Al sterelees withinne a boot am I
Amydde the see bitwixen wyndes two
That inne contrarie stonden euere mo
Allas what is this wondre maladie
ffor hete of cold for cold of hete I dye
And to the god of loue thus seyde he
With pitous vois O lord now ȝoures is
My spirit which that oughte ȝoures be
Ȝow thanke I lord that han me brought to this
But wheither goddesse or womman iwis
She be I not which that ȝe do me serue
But as hire man I wol ay lyue and sterue  
Ȝe stonden in hir eighen myghtily
As in a place vnto ȝoure vertue digne
Wherfore lord if my seruice or I
May liken ȝow so beth to me benigne
ffor myn estat roial I here resigne
Into hire hond and with ful humble chere
Bicome hir man as to my lady dere  
In hym ne deyned spare blood roial
The fyre of loue  the wherfro god me blesse 
Ne him forbar in no degree for al
His vertue or his excellent prowesse
But held hym as his thral lowe in destresse
And brende hym so in soundry wise ay newe
That sexti tyme a day he loste his hewe  
So muche day by day his owene thought
ffor lust to hire gan quiken and encresse
That euery other charge he sette at nought
fforthi ful ofte his hote fire to cesse
To sen hire goodly lok he gan to presse
ffor therby to ben esed wel he wende
And ay the ner he was the more he brende  
ffor ay the ner the fire the hotter is 
This trowe I knoweth al this compaignye
But were he fer or ner I dar sey this
By nyght or day for wisdom or folye
His herte which that is his brestes eye
Was ay on hire that fairer was to sene
Than euere were Eleyne or Polixene  
Ek of the day ther passed nou ȝt an houre
That to hym self a thousand tyme he seyde
Good goodly to whom serue I and laboure
As I best kan now wolde god Criseyde
Ȝe wolden on me rewe er that I deyde
My dere herte allas myn hele and hewe
And lif is lost but ȝe wol on me rewe   
Alle other dredes weren from him fledde
Both of thassege and his sauacioun
Nyn him desire noon other fownes bredde
But argumentes to his conclusioun
That she of him wolde han compassioun
And he to ben hire man while he may dure 
Lo here his lif and from the deth his cure  
The sharpe shoures felle of armes preue
That Ector or his other brethren diden
Ne made hym only therfore ones meue
And ȝet was he where so men wente or riden
ffounde on the beste and lengest tyme abiden
Ther peril was and dide ek swich trauaille
In armes that to thenke it was merueille  
But for non hate he to the Grekes hadde
Ne also for the rescous of the town
Ne made hym thus in armes forto madde
But only lo for this conclusioun
To liken hire the bet for his renoun
ffro day to day in armes so he spedde
That the Grekes as the deth him dredde  
And fro this forth tho refte hym loue his slepe
And made his mete his foo and ek his sorwe
Gan multiplie that whoso tok kepe
It shewed in his hewe both eue and morwe
Therfor a title he gan him forto borwe
Of other siknesse lest men of hym wende
That the hote fire of loue hym brende  
And seyde he hadde a feuere and ferd amys
But how it was serteyn kan I nat seye
If that his lady vnderstood nat this
Or feynede hire she nyste on of the tweye
But wel I rede that by no manere weye
Ne semed it as that she of hym roughte
Or of his peyne or what so euere he thoughte   
But thanne felte this Troilus swich wo
That he was wel neigh wood  for ay his drede
Was this that she som wight hadde loued so
That neuere of hym she wolde han taken hede
ffor which hym thoughte he felte his herte blede
Ne of his wo ne dorste he nat bygynne
To tellen hir for al this world to wynne  
But whan he hadde a space from his care
Thus to hym self ful ofte he gan to pleyne
He seyde O fool now artow in the snare
That whilom iapedest at loues peyne
Now artow hent now gnaw thin owen cheyne
Thow were ay wont eche louere reprehende
Of thing fro which thow kanst the nat defende  
What wol now euery louere seyn of the
If this be wist but euere in thin absence
Laughen in scorne and seyn loo ther goth he
That is the man of so gret sapience
That held vs loueres leest in reuerence
Now thanked be god he may gon in the daunce
Of hem that loue list fiebli for to auaunce  
But O thow woful Troilus god wolde
Sith thow most louen thorugh thi destine
That thow beset were on swich oon that sholde
Know al thi wo al lakked hir pitee
But also cold in loue towardes the
Thi lady is as frost in wynter moone
And thow fordon as snow in fire is soone  
God wold I were aryued in the porte
Of deth to which my sorwe wol me lede
A lord to me it were a gret comforte 
Than were I quyt of languisshyng in drede
ffor be myn hidde sorwe iblowe on brede
I shal byiaped ben a thousand tyme
More than that fol of whos folie men ryme   
But now help god and ȝe swete for whom
I pleyne ikaught ȝe neuere wight so faste 
O mercy dere herte and help me from
The deth for I while that my lyf may laste
More than my self wol loue ȝow to my laste
And with som frendly lok gladeth me swete
Though neuere more thing ȝe me byheete   
Thise wordes and ful many an other to
He spak and called euere in his compleynte
Hire name forto tellen hire his wo
Til nei ȝ that he in salte teres dreynte
Al was for nought she herde nat his pleynte
And whan that he bythought on that folie
A thousand fold his wo gan multiplie  
Bywayling in his chambre thus allone
A frend of his that called was Pandare
Com oones in vnwar and herd hym groone
And say his frend in swich destresse and care
Allas quod he who causeth al this fare
O mercy god what vnhap may this meene
Han now thus soone Grekes maad ȝow leene  
Or hastow som remors of conscience
And art now falle in som deuocioun
And wailest for thi synne and thin offence
And hast for ferde caught attricioun
God saue hem that biseged han oure town
That so kan leye oure iolite on presse
And bringe oure lusty folk to holynesse  
Thise wordes seyde he for the nones alle
That with swich thing he myght hym angry maken
And with an angre don his wo to falle
As for the tyme and his corage awaken
But wel he wist as fer as tonges spaken
Ther nas a man of gretter hardinesse
Thanne he ne more desired worthinesse  
What cas quod Troilus or what auenture
Hath gided the to sen me langwisshinge
That am refus of euery creature
But for the loue of god at my preyinge
Go hennes awey for certes my deyinge
Wol the disese and I mot nedes deye
Therfore go wey ther is na more to seye  
But if thow wene I be thus sik for drede
It is naught so and therfore scorne nou ȝt
Ther is another thing I take of hede
Wel more than aught the Grekes han ȝet wrought
Which cause is of my deth for sorowe and thought
But though that I now telle it the ne leste
Be thow nau ȝt wroth I hide it for the beste  
This Pandare that neigh malt for wo and routhe
fful ofte seyde allas what may this be
Now frend quod he if euere loue or trouthe
Hath ben or is bitwixen the and me
Ne do thow neuere swich a crueltee
To hiden fro thi frend so gret a care
Wostow nau ȝt wel that it am I Pandare  
I wol parten with the al thi peyne
If it be so I do the no comfort
As it is frendes right soth forto seyne
To entreparten wo as glad desport
I haue and shal for trewe or fals report
In wronge and right iloued the al my lyue
Hid nat thi wo fro me but telle it blyue  
Than gan this sorwful Troylus to syke
And seide hym thus god leue it be my beste
To telle it the for sith it may the like
Ȝet wol I telle it though myn herte breste
And wel woot I thow mayst do me no reste
But lest thow deme I truste nat to the
Now herke frend for thus it stant with me   
Loue aȝeins the which whoso defendeth
Hym seluen most hym alderlest auaylleth
With disespeyre so sorwfulli me offendeth
That streight vnto the deth myn herte sailleth
Therto desire so brennyngly me assailleth
That to ben slayn it were a gretter ioie
To me than kyng of Grece ben and Troye  
Suffiseth this my fulle frend Pandare
That I haue seyd for now wostow my wo
And for the loue of god my colde care
So hide it wel I tolde it neuere to mo
ffor harmes myghten folwen mo than two
If it were wist but be thow in gladnesse
And lat me sterue vnknowe of my destresse  
How hastow thus vnkyndely and longe
Hid this fro me thow fol quod Pandarus
Peraunter thow myghte after swich oon longe
That myn auys anoon may helpen vs
This were a wonder thing quod Troilus
Thow koudest neuere in loue thi seluen wisse
How deuel maistow brynge me to blisse  
Ȝe Troilus now herke quod Pandare
Though I be nyce it happeth often so
That oon that excesse doth ful yuele fare
By good counseil kan kepe his frend therfro
I haue my self ek seyn a blynd man goo
Ther as he fel that couthe loken wide
A fool may ek a wis man ofte gide  
A wheston is no keruyng instrument
But ȝet it maketh sharppe keruyng tolis
And there thow woost that I haue au ȝt myswent
Eschuwe thow that for swich thing to e scole is
Thus often wise men ben war by foolys
If thow do so thi wit is wel bewared
By his contrarie is euery thyng declared   
ffor how myghte euere swetnesse han ben knowe
To him that neuere tasted bitternesse
Ne no man may ben inly glad I trowe
That neuere was in sorwe or som destresse
Eke whit by blak by shame ek worthinesse
Ech set by other more for other semeth
As men may se and so the wyse it demeth  
Sith thus of two contraries is o lore
I that haue in loue so ofte assayed
Greuances oughte konne and wel the more
Counseillen the of that thow art amayed
And ek the ne aughte nat ben yuel appayed
Though I desyre with the forto bere
Thyn heuy charge it shal the lasse dere  
I woot wel that it fareth thus by me
As to thi brother Paris an herdesse
Which that icleped was Oenone
Wrote in a compleynte of hir heuynesse
Ȝee say the lettre that she wrote I gesse
Nay neuere ȝet ywys quod Troilus
Now quod Pandare herkne it was thus  
Phebus that first fond art of medicyne
Quod she and couthe in euery wightes care
Remedye and rede by herbes he knew fyne
Ȝet to hym self his konnyng was ful bare
ffor loue hadde hym so bounden in a snare
Al for the doughter of the kyng Amete
That al his craft ne koude his sorwes bete  
Right so fare I vnhappyly for me
I loue one best and that me smerteth sore
And ȝet peraunter kan I reden the
And nat my self  repreue me na more
I haue no cause I woot wel forto sore
As doth an hauk that listeth forto pleye
But to thin help ȝet somwhat kan I seye   
And of o thing right siker maistow be
That certein forto dyen in the peyne
That I shal neuere mo discoueren the
Ne by my trouthe I kepe nat restreyne
The fro thi loue theigh that it were Eleyne
That is thi brother wif if ich it wiste
Be what she be and loue hire as the liste  
Therfore as frend fullich in me assure
And telle me plat now what is thenchesoun
And final cause of wo that ȝe endure
ffor douteth no thyng myn entencioun
Nis nat to ȝow of reprehencioun
To speke as now for no wight may byreue
A man to loue tyl that hym list to leue  
And witteth wel that bothe two ben vices
Mistrusten alle or elles alle leue
But wel I woot the mene of it no vice is
ffor for to trusten som wight is a preue
Of trouth and forthi wolde I fayn remeue
Thi wronge conseyte and do the som wyght triste
Thi wo to telle and tel me if the liste  
The wise seith wo hym that is allone
ffor and he falle he hath non helpe to ryse
And sith thow hast a felawe tel thi mone
ffor this nys naught certein the nexte wyse
To wynnen loue as techen vs the wyse
To walwe and wepe as Nyobe the queene
Whos teres ȝet in marble ben yseene  
Lat be thy wepyng and thi drerynesse
And lat vs lissen wo with oother speche
So may thy woful tyme seme lesse
Delyte nat in wo thi wo to seche
As don thise foles that hire sorwes eche
With sorwe whan thei han mysauenture
And listen naught to seche hem other cure   
Men seyn to wrecche is consolacioun
To haue another felawe in hys peyne
That owghte wel ben oure opynyoun
ffor bothe thow and I of loue we pleyne
So ful of sorwe am I soth forto seyne
That certeinly namore harde grace
May sitte on me for why ther is no space  
If god wol thow art nat agast of me
Lest I wolde of thi lady the bygyle
Thow woost thy self whom that I loue parde
As I best kan gon sithen longe while
And sith thow woost I do it for no wyle
And seyst I am he that thow trustest mooste
Telle me somwhat syn al my wo thow wooste  
Ȝet Troilus for al this no worde seyde
But longe he ley as stylle as he ded were
And after this with sikynge he abreyde
And to Pandarus vois he lente his ere
And vp hise eighen caste he that in feere
Was Pandarus lest that in frenesie
He sholde falle or elles soone dye  
And cryde awake ful wonderlich and sharpe
What slombrestow as in a litargie
Or artow lik an asse to the harpe
That hereth sown whan men the strynges plye
But in his mynde of that no melodie
May sinken hym to gladen for that he
So dul ys of his bestialite  
And with that Pandare of his wordes stente
And Troilus ȝet hym no thyng answerde
ffor why to tellen nas nat his entente
To neuere no man for whom that he so ferde
ffor it is seyd men maketh ofte a ȝerde
With which the maker is hym self ybeten
In sondry manere as thise wyse treten  
And namelich in his counseil tellynge
That toucheth loue that oughte ben secree
ffor of him self it wol ynough out sprynge
But if that it the bet gouerned be
Ek som tyme it is a craft to seme fle
ffro thyng whych in effect men hunte faste 
Al this gan Troilus in his herte caste   
But natheles whan he hadde herd hym crye
Awake he gan to syken wonder soore
And seyde frende though that I stylle lye
I am nat deef now pees and crye namore
ffor I haue herd thi wordes and thi lore
But suffre me my meschief to bywaille
ffor thy prouerbes may me naught auaille  
Nor other cure kanstow non for me
Ek I nyl nat ben cured I wol deye
What knowe I of the queene Nyobe
Lat be thyne olde ensaumples I the preye
No quod tho Pandarus therfore I seye
Swych is delit of foles to bywepe
Hire wo but seken bote they ne kepe  
Now knowe I that ther reson in the failleth
But telle me if I wiste what she were
ffor whom that the al this misaunter ailleth
Dorste thow that I tolde in hire ere
Thi wo sith thow darst naught thi self for feere
And hire bysoughte on the to han som routhe
Why nay quod he by god and by my trouthe  
What nat as bisyly quod Pandarus
As though myn owene lyf lay on this nede
No certes brother quod this Troilus
And whi  for that thow scholdest neuere spede
Wostow that wel   ȝe that is out of drede
Quod Troilus for al that euere ȝe konne
She nyl to noon swich wrecche as I ben wonne  
Quod Pandarus allas what may this be
That thow dispeired art thus causeles
What lyueth nat thi lady bendiste
How wostow so that thow art graceles
Swich yuel is nat alwey booteles
Why put nat impossible thus thi cure
Syn thyng to come is oft in auenture  
I graunte wel that thow endurest wo
As sharp as doth he Ticius in helle
Whos stomak foughles tiren euere moo
That hightyn volturis as bokes telle
But I may nat endure that thow dwelle
In so vnskilful an oppynyoun
That of thi wo is no curacioun   
But oones nyltow for thy coward herte
And for thyn ire and folissh wilfulnesse
ffor wantrust tellen of thy sorwes smerte
Ne to thyn owen help don bysynesse
As muche as speke a reson moore or lesse
But list as he that lest of no thyng recche 
What womman koude louen swich a wrecche  
What may she demen oother of thy deeth
If thow thus deye and she not why it is
But that for feere is ȝolden vp thy breth
ffor Grekes han biseged vs iwys
Lord which a thonk than shaltow han of this
Thus wol she seyn and al the town attones
The wrecche is ded the deuel haue his bones  
Thow mayst allone here wepe and crye and knele 
But loue a womman that she woot it nought
And she wol quyte it that thow shalt nat fele
Unknow vnkist and lost that is vnsought
What many a man hath loue ful deere ybought
Twenty wynter that his lady wiste
That neuere ȝet his lady mouth he kiste  
What sholde he therfore fallen in dispayre
Or be recreant for his owne tene
Or slen hym self al be his lady faire
Nay nay but euere in oon be fresshe and grene
To serue and loue his deere hertes queene
And thynk it is a guerdon hire to serue
A thousand fold moore than he kan deserue  
And of that word took hede Troilus
And thoughte anon what folie he was inne
And how that soth hym seyde Pandarus
That forto slen hym self myght he nat wynne
But bothe don vnmanhod and a synne
And of his deth his lady naught to wite
ffor of his wo god woot she knew ful lite  
And with that thought he gan ful sore syke
And seyde allas what is me best to do
To whom Pandare answered if the like
The beste is that thow telle me al thi wo
And haue my trouthe but thow it fynde so
I be thy boote er that it be ful longe
To pieces do me drawe and sithen honge   
Ȝe so thow seyst quod Troilus tho allas
But god woot it is naught the rather so
fful hard were it to helpen in this cas
ffor wel fynde I that fortune is my fo
Ne al the men that riden konne or go
May of hire cruel whiel the harm withstonde
ffor as hire list she pleyeth with free and bonde  
Quod Pandarus than blamestow fortune
ffor thow art wroth ȝe now at erst I see
Woost thow nat wel that fortune is comune
To eueri manere wight in som degree
And ȝet thow hast this comfort lo perde
That as hire ioies moten ouergone
So mote hire sorwes passen euerychone  
ffor if hire whiel stynte any thyng to torne
Than cessed she fortune anon to be
Now sith hire whiel by no way may soiourne
What woostow if hire mutabilite
Right as thy seluen list wol don by the
Or that she be naught fer fro thyn helpynge
Paraunter thow hast cause forto synge  
And therfore wostow what I the biseche
Lat be thy wo and tornyng to the grounde
ffor whoso list haue helyng of his leche
To hym byhoueth first vnwre his wownde
To Cerberus in helle ay be I bownde
Were it for my suster al thy sorwe
By my wil she sholde al be thyn tomorwe  
Look vp I seye and telle me what she is
Anon that I may gon aboute thy nede
Knowe ich hire aught for my loue telle me this
Thanne wolde I hopen rather for to spede
Tho gan the veyne of Troilus to blede
ffor he was hit and wax al reed for shame
A ha quod Pandare here bygynneth game   
And with that word he gan hym for to shake
And seyde thef thow shalt hyre name telle
But tho gan sely Troilus for to quake
As though men sholde han led hym in to helle
And seyde allas of al my wo the welle
Thanne is my swete fo called Criseyde
And wel neigh with the word for feere he deide  
And whann that Pandare herde hire name neuene
Lord he was glad and seyde frende so deere
Now fare aright for Ioues name in heuene
Loue hath byset the wel be of good cheere
ffor of good name and wisdom and manere
She hath ynough and ek of gentilesse 
If she be fayre thow woost thy self I gesse  
Ny neuere saugh a more bountevous
Of hire estat na gladder ne of speche
A frendlyer na more gracious
ffor to do wel ne lasse hadde nede to seche
What for to don and al this bet to eche
In honour to as fer as she may strecche
A kynges herte semeth by hyrs a wrecche  

ffor certeinly the ferste poynt is this
Of noble corage and wel ordeyne
A man to haue pees with hym self ywis
So oghtist thow for nought but good it is
To loue wel and in a worthy place
The oughte not to clepe it hap but grace
And also thynk and therwith glade the
That sith thy lady vertuous is al
So foloweth it that there is som pitee
Amonges alle thise other in general
And forthi se that thow in special
Requere naught that is a ȝeyns hyre name
ffor vertue streccheth naught hym self to shame  
But wel is me that euere that I was borne
That thow biset art in so good a place
ffor by my trouthe in loue I dorste haue sworne
The sholde neuere han tid thus fayre a grace
And wostow why for thow were wont to chace
At loue in scorn and for despit hym calle
Seynt Idiot lord of thise foles alle  
How often hastow maad thi nyce iapes
And seyd that loues seruantz euerichone
Of nycete ben verray goddes apes
And some wolde mucche hire mete allone
Liggyng abedde and make hem for to grone
And som thow seydest hadde a blaunche feuere
And preydest god he sholde neuere keuere  
And som of hem took on hem for the colde
More than ynough so seydestow ful ofte
And som han feyned ofte tyme and tolde
How that they waken whan thei slepen softe
And thus they wolde han brought hem self alofe
And natheles were vnder at the laste 
Thus seydestow and iapedest ful faste  
Ȝet seydestow that for the moore parte
Thise loueres wolden speke in general
And thoughten that it was a siker arte
ffor faylyng for tassaien ouere al
Now may I iape of the if that I shal
But natheles though that I sholde deye
That thow art non of tho I dorste saye  
Now bet thi brest and sey to god of loue
Thy grace lord for now I me repente
If I mysspak for now my self I loue 
Thus sey with al thyn herte in good entente
Quod Troilus a lord I me consente
And preye to the my iapes thow for ȝiue
And I shal neuere more whyle I liue   
Thow seist wel quod Pandare and now I hope
That thow the goddes wrathe hast al apesed
And sithen thow hast wopen many a drope
And seyd swych thyng wherwith thi god is plesed
Now wolde neuere god but thow were esed
And thynk wel she of whom rist al thi wo
Hereafter may thy comfort be also  
ffor thilke grownde that bereth the wedes wikke
Bereth ek thise holsom herbes as ful ofte
Next the foule netle rough and thikke
The rose waxeth swoote and smothe and softe
And next the valeye is the hill olofte
And next the derke nyght the glade morwe
And also ioie is next the fyn of sorwe  
Now loke that atempre be thi bridel
And for the beste ay suffre to the tyde
Or elles al oure laboure is on ydel
He hasteth wel that wisely kan abyde
Be diligent and trewe and ay wel hide
Be lusty fre perseuere in thy seruyse 
And al is wel if thow werke in this wyse  
But he that parted is in eueri place
Is nowher hol as writen clerkes wyse
What wonder is though swich oon haue no grace
Ek wostow how it fareth of som seruise
As plaunte a tree or herbe in sondry wyse
And on the morwe pulle it vp as blyue
No wonder is though it may neuere thryue  
And sith that god of loue hath the bistowed
In place digne vnto thi worthinesse
Stond faste for to good port hastow rowed
And of thi self for any heuynesse
Hope alwey wel for but if drerinesse
Or ouerehaste oure bothe labour shende
I hope of this to maken a good ende   
And wostow why I am the lasse afered
Of this matere with my Nece trete
ffor this haue I herd seyd of wyse lered
Was neuere man or womman ȝet bigete
That was vnapt to suffren loues hete
Celestial or elles loue of kynde
fforthy som grace I hope in hire to fynde  
And for to speke of hire in specyal
Hire beaute to bithynken and hire youthe
It sit hire naught to ben celestial
As ȝet though that hire liste bothe and kowthe
But trewely it sate hire wel right nowthe
A worthi knyght to louen and cherice 
And but she do I holde it for a vice  
Wherfore I am and wol ben ay redy
To peyne me to do ȝow this seruyse
ffor bothe ȝow to plese thus hope I
Herafterward for ȝe ben bothe wyse
And konne it counseil kepe in swych a wyse
That no man shal the wiser of it be 
And so we may ben gladed alle thre  
And by my trouthe I haue right now of the
A good conceyte in my wit as I gesse
And what it is I wol now that thow se
I thenke sith that loue of his goodnesse
Hath the conuerted out of wikkednesse
That thow shalt ben the beste post I leue
Of al his lay and moost his foos to greue  
Ensample why se now thise wise clerkes
That erren aldermost a ȝeyn a lawe
And ben conuerted from hire wikked werkes
Thorugh grace of god that list hem to hym drawe
Thanne arn they folk that han moost god in awe
And strengest feythed ben I vndirstonde
And konne an errowre alderbest withstonde  
Whan Troilus hadde herd Pandare assented
To ben his help in louyng of Cryseyde
Weex of his wo as who seith vntormented
But hotter weex his loue and thus he seyde
With sobre chere although his herte pleyde
Now blisful Venus help er that I sterue
Of the Pandare I mowe som thank deserue   
But deere frende how shal my wo be lesse
Til this be doon and good ek telle me this
How wiltow seyn of me and my destresse
Lest she be wroth  this drede I moost ywys 
Or nyl nat here or trowen how it is
Al this drede I and ek for the manere
Of the hire Em she nyl no swich thyng here  
Quod Pandarus thow hast a ful gret care
Lest that the Cherl may falle out of the moone
Whi lord I hate of the thi nyce fare
Whi entremete of that thow hast to doone
ffor goddes loue I bidde the a boone
So lat malone and it shal be thi beste
Whi frende quod he now do right as the leste  
But herke Pandare o word for I nolde
That thow in me wendest so gret folie
That to my lady I desiren sholde
That toucheth harm or any vilenye
ffor dredeles me were leuere dye
Than she of me aught elles vnderstode
But that that myghte sownen into goode  
Tho lough this Pandare and anon answerde
And I thi borugh fy no wight doth but so
I roughte naught though that she stood and herde
How that thow seist but fare wel I wol go
Adieu be glad god spede vs bothe two
Ȝef me this labour and this bisynesse
And of my spede be thyn al that swetnesse  
Tho Troilus gan doun on knees to falle
And Pandare in his armes hente faste
And seyde now fy on the Grekes alle
Ȝet parde god shal helpe vs atte laste
And dredelees if that my lyf may laste
And god toforn lo som of hem shal smerte
And ȝet mathenketh that this auant masterte  
Now Pandare I kan namore seye
But thow wis thow woost thow maist thow art al
Mi lif my deth hol in thyn honde I leye
Help now Quod he  ȝis by my trowthe I shal
God ȝelde the frend and this in special
Quod Troilus that thow me recomande
To hire that to the deth me may comande   
This Pandarus tho desirous to serue
His fulle frende than seyde in this manere
ffarwell and thenk I wol thi thank deserue
Haue here my trowthe and that thow shalt wel here
And went his wey thenkyng on this matere
And how he best myghte hire biseche of grace
And fynde a tyme therto and a place  
ffor eueri wight that hath an hous to founde
Ne renneth naught the werk for to bygynne
With rakel hond but he wol bide a stounde
And sende his hertes line out fro withinne
Aldirfirst his purpos forto wynne
Al this Pandare in his herte thoughte
And caste his werk ful wisely or he wroughte  
But Troilus lay tho no lenger down
But vp anon vpon his stede bay
And in the feld he pleyde the leoun
Wo was that Grek that with hym mette aday
And in the town his manere tho forth ay
So goodly was and gat hym so in grace
That ecch hym loued that loked on his face  
ffor he bicom the frendlieste wight
The gentilest and ek the mooste fre
The thriftiest and oon the beste knyght
That in his tyme was or myghte be
Dede were his iapes and his cruelte
His heighe port and his manere estraunge
And ecch of tho gan for a vertue chaunge  
Now lat vs stynte of Troilus a stounde
That fareth like a man that hurt is soore
And is som deel of akyngge of his wownde
Ylissed wel but heeled no deel moore
And as an esy pacyent the loore
Abit of hym that gooth aboute his cure
And thus he dryeth forth his auenture
Owt of thise blake wawes forto saylle
O wynde O wynde the weder gynneth clere
ffor in this see the boot hath swych trauaylle
Of my konnyng that vnneth I it steere
This see clepe I the tempestous matere
Of disespeir that Troilus was inne 
But now of hope the kalendes bygynne  
O lady myn that called art Cleo
Thow be my speed fro this forth and my Muse
To ryme wel this book til I haue do
Me nedeth here noon othere art to vse
fforwhi to euery louere I me excuse
That of no sentement I this endite
But out of Latyn in my tonge it write  
Wherfore I nyl haue neither thank ne blame
Of al this werk but prey ȝow mekely
Disblameth me if any word be lame
ffor as myn auctour seyde so sey I
Ek though I speeke of loue vnfelyngly
No wondre is for it no thyng of newe is
A blynd man kan nat iuggen wel in hewis  
Ȝe knowe ek that in fourme of speche is chaunge
Withinne a thousand ȝeer and wordes tho
That hadden pris now wonder nyce and straunge
Us thenketh hem and ȝet thei spake hem so
And spedde as wel in loue as men now do
Ek forto wynnen loue in sondry ages
In sondry londes sondry ben vsages  
And forthi if it happe in any wyse
That here be any louere in this place
That herkneth as the storie wol deuise
How Troilus com to his lady grace
And thenketh so nold I nat loue purchace
Or wondreth on his speche or his doynge
I noot but it is me no wonderynge  
ffor euery wight which that to Rome wente
Halt nat o path or alwey o manere
Ek in som lond were al the game shente
If that they ferde in loue as men don here
As thus in opyn doyng or in chere
In visityng in forme or seyde hire sawes
fforthi men seyn ecch contree hath hise lawes   
Ek scarsly ben ther in this place thre
That haue in loue seid like and don in al

And the right nought ȝet al is seid or schal
Ek som men graue in tree som in ston wal
As it bitit but syn I haue bigonne
Myn auctour shal I folwen if I konne
In May that moder is of monthes glade
That fresshe floures blew and white and rede
Ben quike agayn that wynter dede made
And ful of bawme is fletyng euery mede
Whan Phebus doth his bryghte bemes sprede
Right in the white Bole it so bitidde
As I shal synge on Mayes day the thrydde  
That Pandarus for al his wise speche

That koude he neuere so wel of louyng preche
It made his hewe aday ful ofte greene
So shop it that hym fil that day a teene
In loue for which in wo to bedde he wente
And made er it was day ful many a wente  
The swalowe Proigne with a sorowful lay
Whan morwen com gan make hire waymentyng
Whi she forshapen was and euere lay
Pandare abedde half in a slomberyng
Til she so neigh hym made hire cheteryng
How Tereus gan forth hire suster take
That with the noyse of hire he gan awake  
And gan to calle and dresse hym vp to ryse
Remembryng hym his erand was to doone
ffrom Troilus and ek his grete emprise
And caste and knewe in good plit was the moone
To doon viage and took his way ful soone
Unto his Neces palays ther biside
Now Ianus god of entree thow hym gyde   
Whan he was come vnto his Neces place
Wher is my lady to hire folk quod he
And they hym tolde and he forth in gan pace
And fond two othere ladys sete and she

Of the siege of Thebes while hem leste

And ȝe it wist in al the town of Troye
I iape nought as euere haue I ioye  
Tho gan she wondren moore than biforne
A thousand fold and down hire eyghen caste
ffor neuere sith the tyme that she was borne
To knowe thyng desired she so faste
And with a syk she seyde hym atte laste
Now Uncle myn I nyl ȝow nought displese
Nor axen more that may do ȝow disese  
So after this with many wordes glade
And frendly tales and with merie chiere
Of this and that they pleide and gonnen wade
In many an vnkouth gladde and depe matere
As frendes doon whan thei ben mette yfere
Tyl she gan axen hym how Ector ferde
That was the townes wal and Grekes ȝerde   
fful wel I thonk it god quod Pandarus
Saue in his arme he hath a litel wownde
And ek his fresshe brother Troilus
The wise worthi Ector the secounde
In whom that alle vertue list habounde
As alle trouthe and alle gentilesse
Wisdom honour fredom and worthinesse  
In good feith Em quod she that liketh me
Thei faren wel god saue hem bothe two
ffor trewelich I holde it gret deynte
A kynges sone in armes wel to do
And ben of good condiciouns therto
ffor grete power and moral vertue here
Is selde yseyn in o persone yfeere  
In good faith that is soth quod Pandarus
But by my trouthe the kyng hath sones tweye 
That is to mene Ector and Troilus 
That certeynly though that I sholde deye
Thei ben as voide of vices dar I seye
As any men that lyuen vndre the sonne
Hire myght is wyde iknowe and what they konne  
Of Ector nedeth it namore forto telle
In al this world ther nys a bettre knyght
Than he that is of worthynesse welle
And he wel moore vertue hath than myght
This knoweth many a wise and worthi wight
The same pris of Troilus I seye
God help me so I knowe nat swiche tweye  
By god quod she of Ector that is sooth
Of Troilus the same thyng trowe I
ffor dredeles men tellen that he doth
In armes day by day so worthily
And bereth hym here at hom so gentily
To eueri wight that alle pris hath he
Of hem that me were leuest preysed be  
Ȝe sey right sooth ywys quod Pandarus
ffor ȝesterday whoso hadde with hym ben
He myghte han wondred vpon Troilus
ffor neuere ȝet so thikke a swarm of been
Ne fleigh as Grekes fro hym gonne fleen
And thorugh the feld in eueri wightes eere
Ther nas no cry but Troilus is there   
Now here now ther he hunted hem so faste
Ther nas but Grekes blood and Troilus
Now hym he hurte and hym al down he caste
Ay wher he wente it was arayed thus
He was hire deth and sheld and lif for vs
That as that day ther dorste non withstonde
Whil that he held his blody swerd in honde  
Therto he is the frendlieste man
Of gret estat that euere I saugh my lyue
And wher hym lest best felawshipe kan
To swich as hym thynketh able forto thryue
And with that word tho Pandarus as blyue
He took his leue and seyde I wol gon henne
Nay blame haue I myn Uncle quod she thenne  
What aileth ȝow to be thus wery soone
And namelich of wommen wol ȝe so
Nay sitteth down by god I haue to doone
With ȝow to speke of wisdom er ȝe go
And eueri wight that was aboute hem tho
That herde that gan fer awey to stonde
Whil they two hadde al that hem liste in honde  
Whan that hire tale al brought was to an ende
Of hire estat and of hire gouernaunce
Quod Pandarus now is it tyme I wende
But ȝet I say ariseth lat vs daunce
And cast ȝoure widewes habit to mischaunce
What list ȝow thus ȝoure self to disfigure
Sith ȝow  is tid thus faire an auenture  
A wel bithought for loue of god quod she
Shal I nat witen what ȝe meene of this
No this thing axeth leyser tho quod he
And eke me wolde muche greue iwis
If I it tolde and ȝe it toke amys
Ȝet were it bet my tonge forto stille
Than seye a soth that were a ȝeyns ȝoure wille  
ffor Nece by the goddesse Mynerue
And Iupiter that maketh the thondre rynge
And by the blisful Venus that I serue
Ȝe ben the womman in this world lyuynge 
Withouten paramours to my wyttynge 
That I best loue and lothest am to greue
And that ȝe weten wel ȝoure self I leue   
Iwis myn vncle quod she grant mercy
Ȝoure frendshipe haue I founden euere ȝit
I am to no man holden trewely
So muche as ȝow and haue so litel quyt
And with the grace of god emforth my wit
As in my gylt I shall ȝow neuere offende
And if I haue er this I wol amende  
But for the loue of god I ȝow biseche
As ȝe ben he that I moost loue and triste
Lat be to me ȝoure fremde manere speche
And sey to me ȝoure Nece what ȝow liste
And with that word hire uncle anoon hire kiste
And seyde gladly leue Nece dere 
Tak it for good that I shal sey ȝow here  
With that she gan hire eighen down to caste
And Pandarus to coghe gan a lite
And seyde Nece alwey lo to the laste
How so it be that som men hem delite
With subtyl art hire tales forto endite
Ȝet for al that in hire entencioun
Hire tale is al for som conclusioun  
And sithen thende is euery tales strengthe
And this matere is so bihouely
What sholde I peynte or drawen it on lengthe
To ȝow that ben my frend so feythfully
And with that word he gan right inwardly
Byholden hire and loken on hire face
And seyde on swich a mirour goode grace  
Than thought he thus if I my tale endite
Aught harde or make a proces any whyle
She shal no sauour haue therin but lite
And trowe I wolde hire in my wil bigyle
ffor tendre wittes wenen al be wyle
Ther as thei kan nought pleynly vnderstonde
fforthi hire wit to seruen wol I fonde  
And loked on hire in a bysi wyse
And she was war that he byheld hire so
And seyde lord so faste ȝe mauise
Sey ȝe me neuere er now what sey ȝe no
Ȝis ȝys quod he and bet wol er I go
But be my trouthe I thoughte now if ȝe
Be fortunat for now men shal it se   
fforto euery wight som goodly auenture
Som tyme is shape if he it kan receyuen
And if that he wol take of it no cure
Whan that it commeth but wilfully it weyuen
Lo neyther cas ne fortune hym deceyuen
But ryght his verray slouthe and wrecchednesse
And swich a wight is forto blame I gesse  
Good auenture O beele Nece haue ȝe
fful lightly founden and ȝe konne it take
And for the loue of god and ek of me
Cache it anon lest auenture slake
What sholde I lenger proces of it make
Ȝif me ȝoure hond for in this world is noon
If that ȝow list a wight so wel bygon  
And sith I speke of good entencioun
As I to ȝow haue told wel here byforn
And loue as wel ȝoure honour and renoun
As creature in al this world yborn
By alle the othes that I haue ȝow sworn
And ȝe be wrooth therfore or wene I lye
Ne shal I neuere sen ȝow eft with eye  
Beth naught agast ne quaketh naught wherto
Ne chaungeth naught for feere so ȝoure hewe
ffor hardely the werst of this is do
And though my tale as now be to ȝow newe
Ȝet trist alwey ȝe shal me fynde trewe
And were it thyng that me thoughte vnsittynge
To ȝow wolde I no swiche tales brynge  
Now my good Em for goddes loue I preye
Quod she come of and telle me what it is
ffor both I am agast what ȝe wol seye
And ek me longeth it to wite ywis
ffor whethir it be wel or be amys
Say on lat me nat in this feere dwelle
So wol I doon now herkeneth I shall telle  
Now Nece myn the kynges deere sone
The goode wise worthi fresshe and free
Which alwey for to don wel is his wone
The noble Troilus so loueth the
That but ȝe helpe it wol his bane be
Lo here is al  what sholde I moore sey
Do what ȝow lest to make hym lyue or dey   
But if ȝe late hym deyen I wol sterue 
Haue here my trouthe Nece I nyl nat lyen 
Al sholde I with this knyf my throte kerue
With that the teris breste out of his eyen
And seyde if that ȝe don vs bothe dyen
Thus gilteles than haue ȝe fisshed fayre
What mende ȝe though that we booth appaire  
Allas he which that is my lord so deere
That trewe man that noble gentil knyght
That naught desireth but ȝoure frendly cheere
I se hym deyen ther he goth vpryght
And hasteth hym with al his fulle myght
fforto ben slayn if his fortune assente
Allas that god ȝow swich a beaute sente  
If it be so that ȝe so cruel be
That of his deth ȝow liste nought to recche
That is so trewe and worthi as ȝe se
Namoore than of a iaper or a wrecche 
If ȝe be swich ȝoure beaute may nat strecche
To make amendes of so cruel a dede
Auysement is good byfore the nede  
Wo worth the faire gemme vertuelees
Wo worth that herbe also that dooth no boote
Wo worth that beaute that is routheles
Wo worth that wight that tret ech vndir foote
And ȝe that ben of beaute crop and roote
If therwithal in ȝow ther be no routhe
Than is it harm ȝe lyuen by my trouthe  
And also think wel that this is no gaude
ffor me were leuere thow and I and he
Were hanged than I sholde ben his baude
As heigh as men myghte on vs alle ysee
I am thyn Em the shame were to me
As wel as the if that I sholde assente
Thorugh myn abet that he thyn honour shente  
Now vnderstond for I ȝow nought requere
To bynde ȝow to hym thorugh no byheste
But only that ȝe make hym bettre chiere
Than ȝe han doon er this and moore feste
So that his lif be saued atte leeste
This al and som and pleynly oure entente
God help me so I neuere other mente   
Lo this requeste is naught but skylle ywys
Ne doute of resoun pardee is ther noon
I sette the worste that ȝe dreden this
Men wolde wondren sen hym com or goon
Therea ȝeins answere I thus anoon
That euery wight but he be fool of kynde
Wol deme it loue of frendshipe in his mynde  
What who wol demen though he se a man
To temple go that he thymages eteth
Thenk ek how wel and wisely that he kan
Gouerne hym self that he nothyng for ȝeteth
That where he cometh he pris and thank hym geteth
And ek therto he shal come here so selde
What fors were it though al the town byhelde  
Swych loue of frendes regneth al this town
And wry ȝow in that mantel euere moo
And god so wys be my sauacioun
As I haue seyd ȝoure beste is to do soo
But alwey goode Nece to stynte his woo
So lat ȝoure daunger sucred ben a lite
That of his deth ȝe be naught forto wite  
Criseyde which that herde hym in this wise
Thought I shal felen what he meneth ywis
Now Em quod she what wolde ȝe deuise
What is ȝoure rede I sholde don of this
That is wel seyd quod he certein best is
That ȝe hym loue a ȝeyn for his louynge
As loue for loue is skilful guerdonynge  
Thenk ek how elde wasteth euery houre
In eche of ȝow a partie of beautee
And therfore er that age the deuoure
Go loue for old ther wol no wight of the
Lat this prouerbe a loore vnto ȝow be
To late ywar quod beaute whan it paste
And elde daunteth daunger at the laste  
The kynges fool is wont to crien loude
Whan that hym thinketh a womman berth hire hye
So longe mote ȝe lyue and alle proude
Tyl crowes feet be growe vnder ȝoure eye
And sende ȝow than a myrour into prye
In which that ȝe may se ȝoure face a morwe
Nece I bidde wisshe ȝow namore sorwe   
With this he stynte and caste adown the hede
And she began to breste awepe anoon
And seyde allas for wo why nere I deede
ffor of this world the feyth is al agoon
Allas what sholden straunge to me doon
Whan he that for my beste frende I wende
Ret me to loue and sholde it me defende  
Allas I wolde han trusted douteles
That if that I thorugh my disauenture
Hadde loued outher hym or Achilles
Ector or any mannes creature
Ȝe nolde han had no mercy ne mesure
On me but alwey had me in repreue
This false worlde allas who may it leue  
What is this al the ioye and al the feste
Is this ȝoure reed is this my blisful cas
Is this the verray mede of ȝoure byheeste
Is al this paynted proces seyd allas
Right for this fyn O lady myn Pallas
Thow in this dredful cas for me purueye
ffor so astoned am I that I deye  
Wyth that she gan ful sorwfully to syke
A may it be no bet quod Pandarus
By god I shal namore come here this wyke
And god toforn that am mystrusted thus
I se ful wel that ȝe sette lite of vs
Or of oure deth allas I woful wrecche
Might he ȝet lyue of me is nought to recche  
O cruel god O dispitouse Marte
O furies thre of helle on ȝow I crye
So lat me neuere out of this hous departe
If that I mente harm or vilenye
But sith I se my lord mot nedes dye
And I with hym here I me shryue and seye
That wikkedly ȝe don vs bothe deye   
But sith it liketh ȝow that I be dede
By Neptunus that god is of the see
ffro this forth shal I neuere eten brede
Til I myn owen herte blood may see
ffor certeyn I wol deye as soone as he
And vp he sterte and on his wey he raughte
Tyl she agayn hym by the lappe kaughte  
Criseyde which that wel neigh starf for feere
So as she was the ferfulleste wight
That myghte be and herde ek with hire ere
And saugh the sorwful ernest of the knyght
And in his preier ek saugh noon vnryght
And for the harm that myghte ek fallen moore
She gan to rewe and dredde hire wonder soore  
And thoughte thus vnhappes fallen thikke
Alday for loue and in swych manere cas
As men ben cruel in hem self and wikke
And if this man sle here hym self allas
In my presence it wol be no solas
What men wolde of it deme I kan nat seye
It nedeth me ful sleighly forto pleie  
And with a sorwful sik she sayde thrie
A lord what me is tid a sory chaunce
ffor myn estat lith now in iupartie
And ek myn Emes lif is in balaunce
But natheles with goddes gouernaunce
I shal so doon myn honour shal I kepe
And ek his lif  and stynte forto wepe  
Of harmes two the lesse is forto chese
Ȝet haue I leuere maken hym good chere
In honour than myn Emes lyf to lese 
Ȝe seyn ȝe nothyng elles me requere
No wis quod he myn owen Nece dere
Now wel quod she and I wol doon my peyne
I shal myn herte a ȝeins my lust constreyne  
But that I nyl nat holden hym in honde
Ne loue a man ne kan I naught ne may
A ȝeins my wyl but elles wol I fonde
Myn honour sauf plese hym fro day to day
Therto nolde I nat ones han seyd nay
But that I drede as in my fantasye
But cesse cause ay cesseth maladie   
And here I make a protestacioun
That in this proces if ȝe depper go
That certeynly for no saluacioun
Of ȝow though that ȝe steruen bothe two
Though al the world on o day be my fo
Ne shal I neuere of hym han other routhe
I graunte wel  quod Pandare by my trowthe  
But may I truste wel therto quod he
That of this thyng that ȝe han hight me here
Ȝe wole it holden trewely vnto me
Ȝe doutelees quod she myn vncle deere
Ne that I shal han cause in this matere
Quod he to pleyn or ofter ȝow to preche
Why no perde what nedeth moore speche  
Tho fillen they in other tales glade
Tyl at the laste O good Em quod she tho
ffor his loue which that vs bothe made
Tel me how first ȝe wisten of his wo
Woot noon of it but ȝe He seyde no
Kan he wel speke of loue quod she I preye
Tel me for I bet me shal purueye  
Tho Pandarus a litel gan to smyle
And seyde by my trouthe I shal ȝow telle
This other day naught gon ful longe while
Inwith the paleis gardyn by a welle
Gan he and I wel half a day to dwelle
Right forto speken of an ordinaunce
How we the Grekes myghten disauaunce  
Soon after that bigonne we to lepe
And casten with oure dartes to and fro
Tyl at the laste he seyde he wolde slepe
And on the gres adoun he leyde hym tho
And I afer gan romen to and fro
Til that I herde as that I welk alone
How he bigan ful wofully to grone  
Tho gan I stalke hym softely byhynde
And sikirly the soothe forto seyne
As I kan clepe a ȝein now to my mynde
Right thus to loue he gan hym forto pleyne
He seyde lord haue routhe vpon my peyne
Al haue I ben rebell in myn entente
Now   lord I me repente   
O god that at thi disposicioun
Ledest the fyn by iuste purueiaunce
Of euery wight my lowe confessioun
Accepte in gree and sende me swich penaunce
As liketh the but from disesperaunce
That may my goost departe awey fro the
Thow be my sheld for thi benignite  
ffor certes lord so soore hath she me wounded
That stood in blak with lokyng of hire eyen
That to myn hertes botme it is ysounded
Thorugh which I woot that I moot nedes deyen
This is the werste I dar me nat bywreyen
And wel the hotter ben the gledes rede
That men hem wrien with asshen pale and dede  
Wyth that he smot his hed adown anon
And gan to motre I noot what trewely
And I with that gan stille awey to goon
And leet therof as no thing wist had I
And com a ȝein anon and stood hym by
And seyde awake ȝe slepen al to longe
It semeth nat that loue doth ȝow longe  
That slepen so that no man may ȝow wake
Who sey euere or this so dul a man
Ȝe frende quod he do ȝe ȝoure hedes ake
ffor loue and lat me lyuen as I kan
But though that he for wo was pale and wan
Ȝet made he tho as fresshe a countenaunce
As though he sholde haue led the newe daunce  
This passed forth til now this other day
It fel that I com romyng al allone
Into his chaumbre and fond how that he lay
Vpon his bed but man so soore grone
Ne herde I neuere and what that was his mone
Ne wist I nought for as I was comyng
Al sodeynly he lefte his complaynyng  
Of which I took somwhat suspecioun
And ner I com and fond he wepte soore
And god so wys be my sauacioun
As neuere of thyng hadde I no routhe moore
ffor neither with engyn ne with no loore
Unnethes myghte I fro the deth hym kepe
That ȝet fele I myn herte for hym wepe   
And god woot neuere sith that I was born
Was I so besy no man forto preche
Ne neuere was to wight so depe isworn
Or he me told who myghte ben his leche
But now to ȝow rehercen al his speche
Or all his woful wordes forto sowne
Ne bid me naught but ȝe wol se me swowne  
But forto saue his lif and elles nought
And to noon harm of ȝow thus am I dryuen
And for the loue of god that vs hath wrought
Swich cheer hym dooth that he and I may lyuen
Now haue I plat to ȝow myn herte shryuen
And sith ȝe woot that myn entent is cleene
Take heede therof for I non yuel meene  
And right good thrifte I prey to god haue ȝe
That han swich oon ykaught withouten net
And be ȝe wis as ȝe be faire to see
Wel in the rynge than is the rubie set
Ther were neuere two so wel ymet
Whan ȝe ben his al hool as he is ȝoure
Ther myghty god ȝit graunte vs see that houre  
Nay therof spak I nought ha ha quod she
As helpe me god ȝe shenden euery deel
O mercy dere Nece anon quod he
What so I spak I mente naught but wel
By Mars the god that helmed is of steel
Now beth naught wroth my blood my Nece dere
Now wel quod she for ȝeuen be it here  
With this he took his leue and home he wente
And lord so he was glad and wel bygon
Criseyde aros no lenger she ne stente
But streght into hire closet wente anon
And set hire doun as stylle as any ston
Aad euery word gan vp and down to wynde
That he had seyd as it com hire to mynde  
And wax somdel astoned in hire thoughte
Right for the newe cas but whan that she
Was ful auysed tho fond she right noughte
Of peril why she ought afered be
ffor man may loue of possibilite
A womman so his herte may tobreste
And she naught loue a ȝein but if hire leste   
But as she sat allone and thoughte thus
Ascry aros at scarmuch al withoute
And men criden in the strete se Troilus
Hath right now put to flight the Grekes route
With that gan al hire meigne forto shoute
A go we se caste vp the ȝates wyde
ffor thorwgh this strete he moot to paleys ride  
ffor other wey is fro the ȝate noon
Of Dardanus there opyn is the cheyne
With that com he and al his folk anoon
An esy pas rydyng in routes tweyne
Right as his happy day was sooth to seyne
ffor which men seyn may nought destourbed be
That shal bityden of necessitee  
This Troilus sat on his baye steede
Al armed saue his hed ful richely
And wownded was his hors and gan to blede
On which he rood a pas ful softely
But swich a knyghtly sighte trewely
As was on hym was nought withouten faille
To loke on Mars that god is of bataille  
So lik a man of armes and a knyght
He was to seen fulfilled of heigh prowesse
ffor bothe he hadde a body and a myght
To don that thing as wel as hardynesse
And ek to seen hym in his gere hym dresse
So fressh so ȝong so weldy semed he
It was an heuen vpon hym forto see  
His helm tohewen was in twenty places
That by a tyssew heng his bak byhynde
His sheeld todasshed was with swerdes and maces
In which men myghte many an arwe fynde
That thirled hadde horn and nerf and rynde
And ay the peple cryde here cometh oure ioye
And next his brother holder vp of Troye  
ffor which he wex a litel reed for shame
When he the peple vpon hym herde cryen
That to byholde it was a noble game
How sobrelich he caste down his eyen
Criseyda gan al his chere aspien
And leet it so softe in hire synke
That to hire self she seyde who ȝaf me drynke   
ffor of hire owen thought she wex al reed
Remembryng hire right thus lo this is he
Which that myn vncle swerith he moot be deed
But I on hym haue mercy and pitee
And with that thought for pure ashamed she
Gan in hire hed to pulle and that as faste
While he and al the peple forby paste  
And gan to caste and rollen vp and down
Withinne hire thought his excellent prowesse
And his estat and also his renown
His wit his shap and ek his gentilesse
But moost hire fauour was for his distresse
Was al for hire and thought it was a routhe
To sleen swich oon if that he mente trouthe  
Now myghte som envious iangle thus
This was a sodeyn loue how myght it be
That she so lightly loued Troilus
Right for the firste syghte ȝe parde
Now whoso seith so mote he neuere ythe
ffor euery thyng a gynnyng hath it nede
Er al be wrought withowten any drede  
ffor I sey nought that she so sodeynly
Ȝaf hym hire loue but that she gan enclyne
To like hym first and I haue told ȝow whi
And after that his manhod and his pyne
Made loue withinne hire herte forto myne
ffor which by proces and by good seruyse
He gat hire loue and in no sodeyn wyse  
And also blisful Venus wel arrayed
Sat in hire seuenthe hous of heuene tho
Disposed wel and with aspectes payed
To helpen sely Troilus of his woo
And soth to seyne she nas nat al a foo
To Troilus in his natiuitee
God woot that wel the sonner spedde he  
Now lat vs stynte of Troilus a throwe
That rideth forth and lat vs torne faste
Unto Criseyde that heng hire hed ful lowe
Ther as she sat allone and gan to caste
Where on she wolde apoynte hire atte laste
If it so were hire Em ne wolde cesse
ffor Troilus vpon hire forto presse   
And lord so she gan in hire thought argue
In this matere of which I haue ȝow tolde
And what to doone best were and what eschewe
That plited she ful ofte in many folde
Now was hire herte warme now was it colde
And what she thoughte somwhat shal I write
As to myn auctour listeth for tendite  
She thoughte wel that Troilus persone
She knew by syghte and ek his gentilesse
And thus she seyde al were it nat to doone
To graunte hym loue ȝit for his worthynesse
It were honour with pleye and with gladnesse
In honestee with swich a lord to deele
ffor myn estat and also for his heele  
Ek wel woot I my kynges sone is he
And sith he hath to se me swich delite
If I wolde outreliche his sighte flee
Peraunter he myghte haue me in dispite
Thorugh whicch I myghte stonde in worse plite
Now were I wis me hate to purchace
Withouten nede ther I may stonde in grace  
In euery thyng I woot ther lith mesure
ffor though a man forbede dronkenesse
He naught forbet that euery creature
Be drynkeles for alwey as I gesse
Ek sith I woot for me is his destresse
I ne aughte naught for that thing hym despise
Sith it is so he meneth in good wyse  
And ek I knowe of longe tyme agon
His thewes goode and that he is nat nyce
Nauantour seith men certein is he noon 
To wis is he to doon so get a vice
Ne als I nyl hym neuere so cherice
That he may make auaunt by iuste cause
He shal me neuere bynde in swich a clause  
Now sette a caas the hardest is ywys
Men myghten demen that he loueth me
What dishonour were it vnto me this
May ich hym lette of that why nay parde
I knowe also and alday heere and se
Men louen wommen al biside hire leue
And whan hem leste namore lat hem byleue   
I thenk ek how he able is forto haue
Of al this noble towne the thriftieste
To ben his loue so she hire honour saue
ffor out and out he is the worthieste
Saue only Ector which that is the beste
And ȝet his lif al lith now in my cure
But swich is loue and ek myn auenture  
Ne me to loue a wonder is it nought
ffor wel woot I my self so god me spede 
Al wolde I that noon wiste of this thought 
I am oon the faireste out of drede
And goodlieste whoso taketh hede
And so men seyn in al the town of Troie
What wonder is though he of me haue ioye  
I am myn owene womman wel at ese
I thank it god as after myn estate
Right ȝong and stonde vnteyd in lusty leese
Withouten ialousie or swich debate
Shal noon housbonde seyn to me chek mate
ffor either they ben ful of ialousie
Or maisterfull or louen nouelrie  
What shal I doon to what fyn lyue I thus
Shal I nat loue in cas if that me leste
What pardieux I am naught religious
And though that I myn herte sette at reste
Upon this knyght that is the worthieste
And kepe awey myn honour and my name
By alle right it may do me no shame  
But right as when the sonne shyneth bright
In March that chaungeth ofte tyme his face
And that a cloude is put with wynd to flight
Which ouersprat the sonne as for a space
A cloudy thought gan thorugh hire soule pace
That ouerspradde hire brighte thoughtes alle
So that for feere almost she gan to falle  
That thought was this allas syn I am free
Sholde I now loue and put in iupertie
My sikernesse and thrallen libertee
Allas how dorst I thenken that folie
May I naught wel in other folk aspie
Hire dredfull ioye hire constreinte and hire peyne
Ther loueth noon that she nath wey to pleyne   
ffor loue is ȝet the mooste stormy lyf
Right of hym self that euere was bigonne
ffor euere som mystrust or nice strif
Ther is in loue som cloude is ouere that sonne
Therto we wrecched wommen nothing konne
Whan vs is wo but wepe and sitte and thinke
Oure wrecche is this oure owen wo to drynke  
Also thise wikked tonges ben so preste
To speke vs harm ek men ben so vntrewe
That right anon as cessed is hire leste
So cesseth loue and forth to loue a newe
But harm ydoon is doon whoso it rewe
ffor though thise men for loue hem first torende
fful sharp bygynnyng breketh ofte at ende  
How ofte tyme hath it yknowen be
The tresoun that to wommen hath ben do
To what fyn is swich loue I kan nat see
Or wher bycometh it whan it is ago
Ther is no wight that woot I trowe so
Where it bycometh lo no wight on it sporneth
That erst was no thing into nought it torneth  
How bisy if I loue ek most I be
To plesen hem that iangle of loue and dremen
And coye hem that they seye noon harm of me
ffor though ther be no cause ȝet hem semen
Al be for harm that folk hire frendes quemen
And who may stoppen euery wikked tonge
Or sown of belles whil that thei ben ronge  
And after that hire thought gan forto clere
And seide he which that nothing vndertaketh
No thyng nacheueth be hym looth or deere
And with an other thought hire herte quaketh
Than slepeth hope and after drede awaketh
Now hoot now cold but thus bitwixen tweye
She rist hire vp and wente hire forto pleye  
Adown the steyre anon right tho she wente
Into the gardyn with hire neces thre
And vp and down ther made many a wente 
fflexippe she Tharbe and Antigone 
To pleyen that it ioye was to see
And other of hire wommen a gret route
Hire folwede in the gardyn al aboute   
This ȝerd was large and rayled alle thaleyes
And shadewed wel with blosmy bowes grene
And benched newe and sonded alle the weyes
In which she walketh arm in arm bitwene
Til at the laste Antigone the shene
Gan on a Troian song to singen cleere
That it an heuen was hire vois to here
