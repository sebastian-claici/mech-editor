WHan that aprille with his schowres swoote  
The drought of Marche haþ perced to þe roote
And bathud euery veyne in swich licour
Of which vertue engendred is þe flour
whan ȝephirus eek with his swete breeth
Enspirud hath in euery holte and heeth
The tendre croppes and þe ȝonge sonne
hath in the Ram his halfe cours Ironne
And smale fowles maken melodie
That slepen al þe night wiþ open yhe
So prikeþ hem nature in here corages
Thanne longen folk to gon on pilgrimages
And palmers for to seeken straunge strondes
To ferne halwes kouthe in sondry londes
And specially from euery schires ende
Of Engelond to Canturbury þey wende
The holy blisful martir for to seeke
That hem haþ holpen whan þat þey were seeke
Byfel þat in þat sesoun on a day
In Southwerk at þe Tabbard as I lay
Redy to wenden on my pilgrimage
To Canturbury with ful deuout corage
At night was come in to þat hostelrie
Wel nyne and twenty in a companye
Of sondry folk by auenture Ifalle
In felaschipe and pilgryms were þei alle
That toward Canturbury wolden ryde


The Chambres and þe stables weren wyde
And wel we weren esud atte beste
And schortly whan þe sonne was to reste
So hadde I spoken with hem euerychon
That I was of here felawschipe anon
And made forward erly to a Ryse
To take oure weye ther as I ȝow deuyse
But natheles whiles I haue tyme and space
Or þat I ferþere in þis tale pace
Me þinkeþ it acordant to resoun
To telle ȝow alle þe condicioun
Of eche of hem so as it semed me  
And which þey weren and of what degre
And eek in what array þat þey were Inne
And at a knight than wol I first bygynne
A Knight þer was and þat a worþy man
That from þe tyme þat he ferst bigan
To ryden out he louede Chyualrye
Trouthe and honour fredom and curtesie
Ful worthi was he in his lordes werre
And þerto hadde he riden noman ferre
As wel in Cristendom as hethenesse
And euere honoured for his worþinesse
At Alisandre he was whan it was wonne
Ful ofte tyme he hadde þe bord bygonne 
Abouen alle naciouns in pruce
In lettowe hadde Reyced and in Ruce
No cristen man so ofte of his degre
In Gernade atte siege hadde he be
At Algesir and riden in Belmarie
At lieys was he and at Satalie
At many a noble ariue hadde he be
whan þey were wonne and in þe greete see
At mortal batailles hadde he ben fiftene
And foughten for oure feith at Tramassene
In lystes þries and ay slayn his foo


This ilke worþi knight hadde ben also
Somtyme with þe lord of Palatye
Ageyn anoþer hethene in Turkye
And eueremore he hadde a souereyn prys
And þough he was worþy he was wys
And of his port as meke as a mayde
he neuer ȝit no vilonye ne sayde
In al his lyf vnto no maner wight
he was a verray perfiȝt gentil knight
But for to telle ȝou of his array
his hors was good but he ne was nouȝt gay
Of fustyan he wered a Gepoun
Al by smoterud with his haburgeoun
For he was late comen from his viage  
And wente for to doon his pilgrimage
With him þer was his sone a ȝong squyer
A louyer and a lusty bacheler
With lokkes crulle as þey were layde in presse
Of twenty ȝeer he was of age I gesse
Of his stature he was of euene lengthe
And wondurly delyuer and gret of strengthe
And he hadde ben som tyme in Chiuachie
In Flaundres in Artoys and in Picardie
And born him wel as in so litel space
In hope to stonden in his lady grace 
Embrowdid was he as it were a mede 
Al ful of fresshe floures white and reede
Syngynge he was or flowtynge al þe day
he was as fressh as is the moneth of may
Schort was his goune with sleeues long and wyde
wel cowde he sitte on hors and wel cowde he ryde
he cowde songes wel make and endite
Iustne and eek daunce and wel purtray and write
So hote he louede þat by nightertale
he sleep nomore þan doþ a nightyngale
Curteys he was lowly and seruysable


And carf byforn his fadur at þe table 
A ȝeman had he  and seruantes nomoo
At þat tyme for him lust ryde soo
And he was clad in coote and hood of grene
A shef of pocok arwes bright and kene
vnder his belte he bar ful þriftily
wel cowde he dresse his takel ȝomanly
His arwes drowpud nouȝt wiþ fetheres lowe
And in his hond he bar a mighty bowe
A not heed hadde he wiþ a broun visage
Of woode craft cowde he wel al þe vsage
vpon his arme he bar a gay bracer
And by his side a swerd and a bokeler
And on þat oþer side a gay daggere
harneysed wel and scharp as poynt of spere
A cristofre on his brest of siluer schene  
An horn he bar þe bawdrik was of grene
A forster was he sothely as I gesse
Ther was also a Nonne a prioresse
That of hire smylyng was ful symple and coy
hire grettest ooth nas but by seynt loy
And sche was clept madame Englentyne
Ful wel sche sang þe seruise deuyne
Entuned in hire nose ful semyly
And frensch sche spak ful faire and fetysly
Aftur þe scole of Stratford atte Bowe
For frensch of Parys was to hire vnknowe
At mete wel Itaught was sche with alle
Sche leet no morsel from hire lippes falle
Ne wette hire fyngres in hire sauce deepe
wel cowde sche carie a morsel and wel keepe
That no drope fil vppon hire brest
In Curtesie was sett al hire lest
hire ouerlippe wypud sche so clene
That in hire Cuppe was no ferþing sene
Of grees whan sche dronken hadde hire draught


Ful semely aftur hir mete sche raught
And sikurly sche was of gret disport
And ful plesant and amyable of port
And peyned hire to counterfete cheere
Of court and ben estatlich of manere
And to ben holden digne of Reuerence
But for to speken of hire conscience
Sche was so charitable and so pitous
Sche wolde weepe if þat sche sawe a Mous
Caught in a trappe if it were deed or bledde
Of smale houndes hadde sche þat sche fedde
With rostud fleissh and mylk and wastel breed
But sore wepte sche if oon of hem were deed
Or if men smot it wiþ a ȝerde smerte
And al was conscience and tendre herte
Ful semely hire wymple Ipynched was
Hire nose streight hire eyen grey as glas
Hire mouth ful smal and þerto softe and reed  
But sikurly sche hadde a fair forheed
It was almost a spanne brood I trowe
For hardily sche was not vndurgrowe
Ful fetys was hire cloke as I was waar
Of smal coral aboute hire arme sche baar
A peire of bedes gaudid al with grene
And þer on heng a broch of gold ful schene
On which was first Iwriten a crowned A
And after þat Amor vincit omnia
Anothur Nonne with hire hadde sche
That was hire Chapelleyn and prestes þre
A Monk þer was a fair for the maistrie
An out Rydere þat loved venerye
A manly man to ben an abbot able
Ful many a deynte hors hadde he in stable
And whan he rood men might his bridel heere
Gyngle in a whistlyng wynd so cleere
And eek as lowde as doþ þe chapel belle


Ther as þe lord was keper of þe selle
The Reule of seynt maure or of seint Beneyt
By cause þat it was old and somdel streyt
This ilke monk leet forby hem pace
And helde aftur þe newe world þe space
he ȝaf nat of þat text a pulled hen
That seiþ þat hunters been noon holy men
Ne þat a monk whan he is Cloysterles
Is likned to a fissche þat is watirles
This is to seyn a monk out of his cloystre
But þilke text hild he not worþ an oystre 
And I seide his opinioun was good
what schulde he studie and make himseluen wood
Vppon a book in Cloystre alway to powre
Or swynke with his handes and laboure
As Austyn byt  how schal þe world be serued
lat austyn haue his swynk to him reserued
Therfore he was a pricasour aright
Greyhoundes he hadde as swifte as fowel in flight
Of prikyng and of huntyng for þe hare  
was al his lust for no cost wolde he spare
I saugh his sleues purfiled atte hond
wiþ grys and that þe fynest of a lond
And for to festne his hood vndur his chyn
he hadde of gold ywrought a curious pyn
A loue knotte in þe gretter ende þer was
His heed was ballid and schon as eny glas
And eek his face as he hadde be anoynt
he was a lord ful fat and in good poynt
his eyen steep and rollyng in his heed
That stemed as a forneys of a leed
His bootes souple his hors in gret estat
Now certeinly he was a fair prelat
he was not pale as a forpyned goost
A fat swan loued he best of eny roost
His palfray was as broun as eny berye


A Frere þer was a wantoun and a merye
A lymytour a ful solempne man
In alle the ordres foure is noon þat can
So moche of daliaunce and fair langage
He hadde Imade many a fair mariage
Of ȝonge wymmen at his owne cost
vnto his ordre he was a noble post
Ful wel biloued and famulier was he
with Frankeleyns ouer al in his cuntre
And eek with worþi wommen of þe toun
For he hadde power of confessioun
As seyde himself more þan a curat
For of his ordre he was licenciat
Ful sweetly herde he confessioun
And plesaunt was his absolucioun
He was an esy man to ȝeue penance
Ther as he wiste han a good pitance
For vnto a poure ordre for to ȝeue
Is signe þat a man is wel Ischreue
For if he ȝaf he dorste make auaunt
He wiste þat a man was repentaunt
For many a man so hard is of his herte  
He may not wepe þough him sore smerte
Therfore in stede of wepyng and prayeres
Men mooten ȝiuen siluer to þe pore freres
His typet was ay farsud ful of knyfes
And pynnes for to ȝiue faire wyfes
And certayn he hadde a mery noote
wel couthe he synge and pleye on a Rote
Of ȝeddynges he bar vtturly þe prys
his nekke whit was as þe flour delys
Ther to he strong was as a Champioun
He knew wel þe tauernes in euery toun
And euery Ostiller or gay tapstere
Bet þan a laȝer or a beggere
For vnto such a worþi man as he


Acorded not as by his faculte
To haue with sike laȝars aqueyntaunce
It is not honest it may not avaunce
For to delen with such poraile
But al with riche and sellers of vitaille
And ouer al þer eny profyt schulde arise
Curteys he was and lowe of seruyse
Ther was no man no wher so vertuous
He was þe beste begger in al his hous
    
For þough a widewe hadde but oo schoo
So plesaunt was his In principio
ȝet wolde he haue a ferthing or he wente
his purchace was bettur þan his rente
And rage he couþe and pleye as a whelpe
In louedayes ther couthe he mochil helpe
For þer was he not like a cloysterer
With a thredbare cope as a pore scoler
But he was like a maister or a pope
Of double worstede was his semy cope 
That rounded was as a belle out of presse
Somwhat he lipsede for wantounesse 
To make his Englissch swete vpon his tunge
And in his harpyng whan þat he hadde sunge
His eyȝen twynkeled in his heed aright  
As don þe sterres in þe frosty night
This worthi lymytour was called huberd
A Marchaunt was þer wiþ a forked berd
In motteleye high on horse he sat
vppon his heed a Flaundrisch beuer hat
His botus clapsud faire and fetously
His resons he spak ful solempnely
Swownynge alway the encres of his wynnyng
He wolde þe see were kepud for eny þing
Bitwixe Middulburgh and Orewelle 


wel couþe he in eschange scheeldes selle 
This worþi man ful wel his witte bisette
Ther wiste no man that he was in dette
So estately was he of gouernaunce
with his bargayns and with his cheuysaunce
For sothe he was a worþi man with alle
Bot soth to say I not what men him calle 
A Clerk þer was of Oxenford also
That vnto logik hadde longe Igo
Al so lene was his hors as is a rake
And he was not right fat I vndertake
But lokede holwe and þerto soburly
Ful thredbare was his ouerest courtepy
For he hadde nouȝt geten hym ȝit a benefice
Ne was not worþy to hauen an office
For him was leuer haue at his beddes heed
Twenty bookes cloþed in blak and reed
Of Aristotil and of his philosophie
Then Robus Riche or fithul or Sawtrie
But al þough he were a philosophre
Ȝet hadde he but litul gold in cofre
But al þat he might gete and his frendes sende
On bookes and his lernyng he it spende
And busily gan for þe soules pray
Of hem þat ȝaf him wherwith to scolay
Of studie tooke he most cure and heede
Not oo word spak he more þan was neede
Al þat he spak it was of heye prudence  
And schort and quyk and ful of gret sentence
Sownynge in moral manere was his speche 
And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche
A Sergeant of lawe war and wys
That often hadde ben atte paruys
Ther was also ful riche of excellence
Discret he was and of gret Reuerence
He semed such his wordes were so wise


Iustice he was fuloften in assise
By patent and by pleyn comissioun
For his science and for his heih renoun
Of fees and Robes had he many oon
So gret a purchasour was þer no wher noon
Al was fee symple to him in effecte
his purchasyng might nought ben to hī m suspecte
No wher so besy a man as he þer nas 
And ȝit he semed besier þan he was
In termes hadde caas and domes alle
That fro þe tyme þat kyng were falle
Ther to he couþe endite and make a þing
Ther couþe no man pynche at his writyng
And euery statute couthe he pleyn by roote
He rood but hoomly in a medled coote
Gird with a seynt of silk wiþ barres smale
Of his array telle I no lenger tale
A Frankeleyn þer was in his companye 
whit was his berde as þe dayesye
Of his complexioun he was sangwyn
wel loued he in þe morn a sop of wyn
To lyue in delite was al his wone
For he was Epicurius owne sone
That heeld opynyoun þat pleyn delyt
was verraily felicite perfyt
An houshaldere and þat a gret was he
Seynt Iulian he was in his countre
his breed his ale was alway after oon
A bettre envyned man was no wher noon
wiþoute bake mete was neuer his hous  
Of fleissch and fissch and þat so plentyuous
Hit snewed in his hous of mete and drynk
Of alle deyntees þat men cowde þynk
Aftur þe sondry sesouns of þe ȝeer
He chaunged hem at mete and at soper
Ful many a fat partrich had he in mewe


And many a brem and many a luce in stewe
Woo was his Cook but if his sauce were
Poynant and scharp and redy al his gere
His table dormant in his halle alway·
Stood redy couered al þe longe day
At sessions þer was he lord and sire
Ful ofte tyme he was knight of þe schire
An Anlas and a gipser al of silk
heng at his gerdul whit as morne mylk
A schirreue hadde he ben and a counter
was nowher such a worthi vauaser
AN haburdassher and a Carpenter
A webbe a deyer and a Tapicer
weren with vss eeke clothed in oo lyuere
Of a solempne and gret fraternite
Ful freissh and newe his gere piked was
Here knyfes were Ichapud nat with bras
But al with siluer wrought ful clene and wel
here gurdles and here pouches euery del
wel semed eche of hem a fair burgeys
To sitten in a ȝeldehalle on þe deys
Euery man for þe wisdom þat he can
was schaply for to ben an aldurman ·
For Catel hadde þey Inough and rente 
And eek here wyfes wolde it wel assente 
And elles certeyn hadde þei ben to blame
It is right fair for to be clept Ma Dame
And for to go to vigilies al byfore
And han a mantel rially Ibore
A Cook þei hadde with hem for þe nones
To boyle chiknes and þe mary bones
And poudre marchaunt  tart and galyngale  
wel cowde he knowe a drauȝt of londoun ale
He cowde roste sethe boille and frie
Make mortreux and wel bake a pye
But gret harm was it as it semede me


That on his schyne a mormal hadde he
For blankmanger he made with þe beste
A Schipman was þer wonyng fer by weste
For ought I woot he was of Dertemouthe
He rood vpon a rouncy as he couþe
In a gowne of faldyng to þe kne
A dagger hangyng on a laas hadde he
Aboute his nekke vnder his arm a doun
The hoote somer had maad his hew al broun
And certeinly he was a good felawe
Ful many a draught of wyn had he drawe
From Burdeuxward whil þat þe chapman sleep
Of nyce conscience took he no keep
If þat he foughte and hadde þe heiȝer hand
By water he sente hem hoom to euery land
But of his craft to rikne wel þe tydes
his stremes and his dangers him bisides
His herbergh and his mone his lodemenage
Ther was non such from hulle to Cartage
Hardy he was and wys to vndertake
with many a tempest hath his berd ben schake
He knew wel alle þe hauenes as þei were
From Scotlond to the cape of fynestere
And euery Cryk in Bretayne and in Spayne
His Barge yclepud was the Magdelayne
Ther was also a Doctour of phisik
In al þis world ne was þer non him lyk
To speke of phisik and of Surgerye
For he was groundud in astronomye
he kepte his pacient wondurly wel
In houres by his magik naturel
wel cowde he fortune the ascendent
Of his ymages for his pacient
He knew þe cause of euery maladye  
were it of cold or hete or moyst or drye
And where þei engendrid and of what humour


he was a verrey parfight practisour
The cause Iknowe and of his harm þe roote
Anon he ȝaf þe syke man his boote
Ful redy hadde he his apotecaries
To sende him dragges and his letuaries
For eche of hem made oþur to wynne
Here frendschipe nas not newe to begynne
wel knew he þe olde Esculapius
And deiscorides and eeke Rusus
Old ypocras haly and Galien
Serapyon Razis and Auycen
Auerrois damascen and Constantyn
Bernad and Gatisden and Gilbertyn
Of his diete mesurable was he
For it was of no superfluite
But of gret norisching and digestible
His studie was but litel on þe bible
In sangwyn and in pers he clad was al
Lyned with taffata and with Sendal
And ȝit he was but esy in dispence
He kepte þat he wan in pestilence
For gold in phisik is a cordial
Ther fore he louede gold in special
A Good wif was þer of byside bathe
But sche was somdel deef and þat was skaþe
Of cloth makyng sche hadde such an haunt
Sche passed hem of ypris and of Gaunt
In al þe parisshe wyf ne was ther noon
That to þe offryng byforn hire schulde goon
And if þer dide certeyn so wroth was sche
That sche was þanne out of alle charite
hire keuerchefs weren ful fyne of grounde
I durste swere þey weyȝede ten pounde
That on a sonday were vpon hire heed
hire hosen were of fyn scarlett reed
Ful streyte yteyed and schoos ful moyste and newe  

Bold was hir face and fair and reed of heewe
Sche was a worþy womman al hire lyfe
Housbondes atte chirche dore hadde sche fyfe
withouten oþur companye in ȝouthe
But therof needeth nouȝt to speke as nouthe
And þries hadde sche ben at Ierusalem
Sche hadde passud many a straunge streem
At Rome sche hadde ben and at Boloyne
In Galice at seynt Iame and at Coloyne
Sche cowde moche of wandryng by þe weye
Gattothud was sche soþly for to seye
vppon an amblere esely sche sat
wymplid ful wel and on hire heed an hat
As brood as is a bocler or a Targe
A foot mantel aboute hire hupes large
And on hire feet a paire of spores scharpe
In felawschipe wel cowde lawghe and carpe
Of Remedyes of loue sche knew par chaunce
For of þat art sche knew þe olde daunce
A Good man was ther of Religioun
And was a pore persoun of a toun
But riche he was of holy þought and werk
He was also a lerned man a Clerk
That cristes gospel gladly wolde preche
His parischens deuoutly wold he teche
Benigne he was and wondur diligent
And in aduersite ful pacient
And such he was Iproued ofte sithes
Ful loth were him to curse for his tythes
But raþer wolde he ȝeuen out of dowte
vnto his pore parisschens aboute
Of his offrynge and eek of his substaunce
he cowde in litel þing han suffisance
wyd was his parisch and houses fer asondur
But he ne lafte not for reyn ne þondur
In siknesse ne in meschief to visite


The ferrest in his parissche moche and lite
Vppon his feet and in his hond a staf  
This noble ensample vnto his scheep he ȝaf
That ferst he wroughte and after þat he taughte
Out of þe gospel he þo wordes caughte 
And þis figure he addid ȝit þerto
That if gold ruste what schulde yren doo
For if a prest be foul on whom we truste
No wondur is a lewid man to ruste
And schame it is if a prest take kepe
A schiten schepperd and a clene schepe
wel oughte a prest ensample for to ȝiue
By his clennesse how þat his scheep schulde lyue
he sette not his benefice to huyre
And lefte his scheep encombred in þe myre
And ran to londoun vnto seynte poules
To seeken him a chaunterie for soules
Or with a brethurhede be wiþholde
But dwelte at hoom and kepte wel his folde 
So þat þe wolf ne made it not myscarye
He was a schepparde and no mercenarie
And þough he holy were and vertuous
he was to senful man nought dispitous
Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne
But in his teching discret and benigne
To drawe folk to heuen by clennesse
By good ensample was his busynesse
But it were eny parsone obstinat
what so he were of high or lowe estat
him wolde he snybbe scharply for þe nones
A bettre preest I trowe ther nowher non is
he waytud after no pompe ne reuerence
Ne maked him a spiced conscience 
But cristes lore and his apostles twelue
he taught and ferst he folwed it himselue
With hem þer was a plough man his broþur


That hadde Ilad of dong ful many a foþur
A trewe swynker and a good was hee
Lyuynge in pees and parfiȝt charitee
God loued he best al his trewe herte  
At alle tymes þough him gamed or smerte
And þanne his neighebour right as himselue
He wolde threisshe and þerto dyke and delue
For cristes sake with euery pore wight
wiþouten huyre if it laye in his might
His tythes payede he ful faire and wel
Bathe of his owne swynk and his catel
In a tabbard Rood vpon a mere
Ther was also a Reeue and a mellere
A sompnour and a pardoner also
A maunciple and my self þer was no mo
THe mellere was a stout carl for þe nones
Full big he was of braun and eek of boones 
That preuede wel for ouer al þer he cam
At wrastlynge he wolde bere awey þe Ram
He was schort schuldred broode a þikke knarre
Ther was no dore þat he nolde heue of harre
Or breke it with a rennyng with his heed
his berd as ony sowe or fox was reed
And þerto brood as þough it were a spade
vpon þe cop right of his nose he hade
A werte and þer on stood a tuft of heres
Reede as þe berstles of a souwes eeres
his noseþurles blake were and wyde
A swerd and a bocler baar he by his side
His mouth as wyde was as a gret forneys
he was a Iangler and a golyardeys
And þat was most of synne and harlotries
wel cowde he stele corn and tollen þries
And ȝet he hadde a þombe of golde parde
A whiȝt cote and blewe hood wered he
A bagge pipe cowde he blowe and sowne


And þerwiþ al he brought vs out of towne
A Gentil maunciple was ther of a temple
Of which achatours mighten take exemple
For to be wys in beyyng of vitaille
For wheþur þat he payde or took by taille
Algate he wayted so in his acate  
That he was ay biforn and in good state
Now is not þat of god a ful fair grace
That such a lewed mannes wit schal pace
The wisdom of an heep of lernede men
Of maystres hadde moo þan þries ten
That were of lawe expert and curious
Of which þer were a doseyn in an hous
worthi to be stiwardȝ of Rente and lond
Of any lord þat is in Engelond
To make him lyue by his propre good
In honour detteles but if he were wood
Of lyue as scarsly as he can desire
And able for to helpen al a schire
In any caas þat mighte falle or happe
And ȝit this maunciple sette here aller cappe
The Reeue was a sklendre colerik man
his berd was schaue as neigh as euer he can
his heer was by his Eres neigh Ischorn
his top was dockud lyk a preest biforn
Ful longe wern his leggus and ful lene
Al like a staff ther was no calf ysene
wel cowde he kepe a gerner and a bynne
Ther was non auditour cowde on him wynne
wel wiste he by the drought and by þe Reyn
The ȝeeldyng of his seed and of his greyn
his lordes scheep his neet his dayerie
his swyn his hors his stoor and his pultrie
was holly in this Reeues gouernynge
And by his couenaunt ȝaf þe Rekenynge
Syn þat his lord was xxti ȝeer of age


Ther couthe noman bringe him in arrerage
Ther nas baillif ne herde ne oþer hyne
That þey ne knewe his sleight and his couyne
They were adrad of him as of þe deth
his wonyng was ful fair vpon an heth
wiþ grene trees Ischadewed was his place
he cowde bettre þan his lord purchace
Ful riche he was Istored priuely  
His lord wel couthe he plese subtilly
To ȝeue him and lene him of his owne good
And haue a þank a cote and eek an hood
In ȝouþe he lerned hadde a good mester
he was a wel good wright a carpenter
This Reeue sat vpon a wel good stot
That was a pomely gray and highte Scot
A long surcote of blew vppon he hadde
And by his side he bar a Rusty bladde
Of Northfolk was þis Reeue of which I telle
Byside a toun men callen Baldeswelle
Tukkud he was as is a frere aboute
And euer he rood the hynderest of þe route
A Sompnour was þer with vs in þat place
That hadde a fyrreed Cherubyns face
For sawceflem he was with eyȝen narwe
As hoot he was and leccherous as a sparwe
Wiþ skalled browes blak and piled berd
Of his visage children weren aferd
Ther nas quyk siluer litarge ne bremston
Boras Ceruce ne oille of Tartre noon
Ne oynement þat wolde clense and byte
That him might helpen of his whelkes white
Ne of þe knobbes sittyng on his cheekes
wel loued he garleek oynouns and ek leekes
And for to drinke strong wyn reed as blood
Thanne wolde he speke and crye as he were wood
And whan that he wel dronken hadde þe wyn


Than wolde he speke no word but latyn
A fewe termes hadde he tuo or þre
That he hadde lerned out of som decree
No wondur is he herde it al þe day
And eek ȝe knowe wel how þat a Iay
Can clepe watte as wel as can þe pope
But whoso wolde in oþur þing him grope
Thanne hadde he spent al his philosophie
Ay questio quid Iuris wolde he crye
He was a gentil harlot and a kynde  
A bettre felaw schulde men nowher fynde
He wolde suffre for a quart of wyn
A good felawe han his concubyn
A xij moneth and excuse him atte fulle
And pryuely a Fynch eek cowde he pulle
And if he fond owher a good felawe
he wolde teche him for to haue non awe
In such a caas of þe archedeknes curs
But if a mannes soule were in his purs
For in his purs he scholde punyssched be
Purs is the Ercedeknes helle quod he
But wel I woot he lyeth right in dede
Of cursyng oweth ech gulty man to drede
For curs wol slee right as assoillyng saueth
And also ware him of a Significauit
In daunger he hadde at his owne assise
The ȝonge gurles of the Diocise
And knew here counseil and was al here red
A garland had he set vpon his heed
As gret as it were for an ale stake
A bokeler had he maad him of a cake
With him þer rood a gentil Pardoner
Of Rounciual his frend and his comper
That streyt was comen from þe court of Rome
Ful lowde he sang com hider loue tome
The sompnour bar to him a stif burdoun


was neuere trompe of half so gret a soun
This pardoner hadde heer as ȝelwe as wex
But smothe it heng as doth a strike of Flex
By vnces hynge his lokkes þat he hadde
And þerwith he his schuldres ouerspradde
Ful thenne it lay by culpons on and oon
And hood for Iolitee ne wered he noon
For it was trussud vp in his walet
Him þought he rood al of þe newe get
Discheuele sauf his cappe he rood al bare
Suche glaryng eyȝen hadde he as an hare
A vernicle hadde he sowed on his cappe  
His walet lay byforn him in his lappe
Bret ful of pardoun come from Rome al hoot
A voys he hadde as smal as eny goot
No berd ne hadde he ne neuer scholde haue
As smothe it was as it ware late Ischaue 
I trowe he were a geldyng or a mare
But of his craft fro Berwyk vnto ware
Ne was þer such another pardoner
For in his male he hadde a pilwebeer
which þat he saide was oure lady veyl
he seide he hadde a gobet of þe seyl
That seynt Petur hadde whan he wente
Vppon þe see til ihū crist him hente
he hadde a cros of latoun ful of stones
And in a glas he hadde pigges bones
But with þise reliqes whanne þat he fand
A pore parsoun dwellyng vppon land
vpon a day he gat him more moneye
Than þat þe parsoun gat in monthes tweye
And þus with feyned flaterie and Iapes
he made þe parsoun and þe poeple his apes
But trewely to tellen atte laste
He was in churche a noble ecclesiaste
wel cowde he rede a lessoun or a storye


But altherbest he sang an offertorie
For wel he whan þat song was songe
he moste preche and wel affyle his tunge
To wynne siluer as he right wel cowde
Therefore he sang ful meriely and lowde
NOw haue I told ȝou schortly in a clause
Thestat þarray þe nombre and eek þe cause
why þat assembled was þis companye
In Southwerk at þis gentil Ostelrie
That highte þe Tabbard faste by þe belle
But now is tyme to ȝow for to telle
how þat we bare vs in þat ilke night
whan we were in that Ostelrie alight
And aftur wol I telle of oure viage  
And al þe remenaunt of oure pilgrimage
But ferst I pray ȝou of ȝour curtesie
That ȝe ne rette it nat my vilanye
Though þat I speke al pleyn in þis matere
And telle ȝou here wordes and here cheere
Ne though I speke here wordes propurly
For þis ȝe knowen also wel as I
whoso schal telle a tale aftur a man
He moste reherce as neigh as euer he can
Euery word if it be in his charge
Al speke he neuer so Rudely ne large
Or elles he moot telle his tale vntrewe
Or feyne þing or fynde his wordes newe
He may not spare þough he were his broþur
He moste as wel sey oo word as anoþur
Crist spak himself ful broode in holy writ
And wel ȝe woot no vilanye is it
Eke Plato seith whoso þat can him rede
The wordes mot be cosyn to þe dede
Also I pray ȝou to forȝeue it me
Al haue I folk nat set in here degre
Here in þis tale as þat þei schulde stonde


My witt is thynne ȝe may wel vndurstonde
GReet cheere made oure ost vs euerichon
And to þe souper sette he vs anon
He serued vs with vitaille atte beste
Strong was þe wyn and wel to drynke vs leste
A semely man oure Ooste was wiþ alle
For to han been a Marchal in an halle
A large man was he with eyȝen stepe
A fairere burgeys is þer noon in chepe
Bold of his speche and wys and wel Itaught
And of manhede lakkede he right naught
Eke þerto he was right a mery man
And after soper playen he bygan
And spak of myrthe among oþur þinges
whan þat we hadde maad our rekenynges
And sayde þus Lo lordynges trewely  
Ȝe ben to me right welcome hertily
For by my trouthe if þat I schal not lye
I ne saugh þis ȝeer so mery a companye
At oones in this herbergh as is now
Fayn wold I do ȝow merthe wiste I how
And of a merthe I am right now bythought
To doon ȝou eese and it schal coste nought
Ȝe goon to Caunturbury god ȝou speede
The blisful martir quyte ȝou ȝoure meede
And wel I woot as ȝe gon by þe weye
Ȝe schapen ȝow to talken and to pleye
For trewely comfort ne merthe is noon
To Ryde by þe weye domb as a stoon
And þerfore wol I make ȝou disport 
As I seyde erst and do ȝou som confort
And if ȝow liketh alle by oon assent
Now for to standen at my Iuggement
And for to werken as I schal ȝou seye
To morwe whan ȝe riden by þe weye
Now by my fadres soule þat is deed


But ȝe be merye smyteþ of myn heed
hold vp ȝoure hond withoute more speche
Oure counseil was not longe for to seche
vs þoughte it nas nat worþ to make it wys
And graunted him wiþoute more avys
And bad him seie his verdite as him leste
LOrdynges quoþ he now herkeneþ for þe beste
But taketh not I pray ȝou in disdayn
This is þe poynt to speken schort and playn
That ech of ȝow to schorte with ȝoure weie 
In þis viage schal telle tales tweye
To Caunturburiward I mene it so
And homward he schal tellen oþur tuo
Of auentures þat þer han bifalle
And which of ȝow þat bereþ him best of alle
That is to seye þat telleþ in þis caas
Tales of best sentence and of solas
Schal han a soper at ȝour alþer cost  
Here in þis place sittynge by þis post
whan þat we comen ageyn from Canturbery
And for to make ȝou þe more mery
I wol my seluen gladly with ȝou ryde
Right at myn owen cost and be ȝoure gyde
And whoso wole my Iuggement withseie
Schal paye for al we spenden by þe weye
And if ȝe vouche sauf þat it be so
Telle me anoon wiþouten wordes moo
And I wole erely schappe me þerfore
This þing was graunted and oure othus swore
with ful glad herte and prayden him also
That he would vouche sauf for to doon so
And þat he wolde ben oure gouernour
And of our tales Iugge and reportour
And sette a souper at a certeyn prys
And we wolde rewled be at his deuys
In heygh and lowe and þus by oon assent


We been acorded to his Iuggement
And þervpon þe wyn was fet anoon

wiþouten eny lengere taryinge
A morwe whan þat þe day bigan to sprynge
vp roos oure Ost and was oure althur cok
And gaderud vs togidur alle in a flok
And forth we riden a litel more þan paas
vnto þe waterynge of seint Thomas
And þere oure Ost bigan his hors areste
And seyde lordus herkeneþ if ȝow leste
Ȝe woot ȝoure forward and I it ȝou recorde
If euesong and morwesong acorde
Lat se now who schal telle ferst a tale
As euere I moote drinke wyn or ale
whoso be rebel to my Iuggement
Schal paye for al þat by the weye is spent
Now draweth Cut er þat we forther twynne
which þat hath þe schortest schal bygynne
Sire knight quoþ he maister and my lord  
Now draweth Cut for þat is myn acord
Cometh ner quod he my lady prioresse
And ȝe sir Clerk lat be ȝour schamfastnesse
Ne studieth nat ley hand to euery man
Anon to drawen euery wight bigan
And schortly for to tellen as it was
were it by auenture or sort or cas
The soth is þis the Cut fil to the knight
Of which ful glad and bliþe was euery wight
And telle he moste his tale as was resoun
By forward and by composicioun
As ȝe han herd what needeþ wordes moo
And whan þis goode man seigh þat it was so
As he that wys was and obedient
To kepe his forward by his fre assent
He seyde syn I schal bygynne the game


what welcome be þou cut a goddus name
Now lat vs ryde and herkneþ what I seye
And with þat word we riden forþ oure weye
And he bigan with right a merie chere
His tale and seide right in þis manere
WHilom as olde stories tellen vs
Ther was a Duk þat highte Theseus
Of Athenes he was lord and gouernour
And in his tyme swich a conquerour
That gretter was ther non vnder þe sonne
Ful many a Riche Contre hadde he wonne
That with his wisdam and his chiualrie
He conquered al the regne of Femynye
That whilom was Icleped Cithea
And weddede the queen Ipolita
And brought hire hoom with him in his Contre
with moche glorie and gret solempnite
And eek hire ȝonge suster Emelye
And þus with victorie and with melodye
Lete I þis noble duk to Athenes ryde 
And al his Ost in armes him biside  
At certes if it nere to long to heere
I wolde han told ȝow fully þe manere
How wonnen was the regne of Femenye
By Theseus and by his Chiualrye
And of þe grete bataille for þe nones
Bytwix athenes and amazones
And how asegid was ypolita
The faire hardy Quyen of Cithea
And of þe feste that was at hire weddynge
And of þe tempest at hire hoom comynge
But al þat þing I most as now forbere
I haue god wot a large feeld to Ere
And wayke ben þe Oxen in my plough
The remenaunt of the tale is long Inough
I wol not lette eek non of al þis rowte


lat euery felawe telle his tale aboute
And lat see now who schal þe soper wynne
And ther I lafte I wolde agayn begynne
This Duk of whom I make mencioun
whan he was comen almost vnto þe toun
In al his wele and in his moste pryde
he was war as he cast his eyȝe aside
wher þat ther kneled in þe hye weye
A companye of ladies tweye and tweye
Ech after other clad in cloþes blake
But such a cry and such a woo þey make
That in þis world nys creature lyuynge
Ther herde such anoþer weymentynge
And of þat cry ne wolde þey neuer stenten
Til þey þe Reynes of his bridel henten
what folk be ȝe þat at myn hom comynge
Partourben so my feste with cryenge
Quod Theseus haue ȝe so gret enuye
Of myn honour þat þus compleyne and crie
Or who hath ȝow mysboden or offendid
And telleþ me if it may ben amendid
And why þat ȝe ben clad þus al in blak  
The oldest lady of hem alle spak
whan sche had swowned with a dedly chere
That it was routhe for to seen or heere
And seyde lord to whom fortune haþ ȝeuen
victorie and as a conquerour to luyen
Nought greueth vs ȝoure glorie and honour
But we beseken mercy and socour
Haue mercy on oure woo and oure distresse
Som drope of pitee thurgh ȝoure gentilnesse
Vppon vs wrecchede wommen lat þou falle
For certus lord ther nys noon of vs alle
That sche nath ben a duchesse or a queene
Now be we Caytifs as it is wel seene
Thanked be fortune and hire false wheel


That noon estat assureth to ben weel
And certus lord to abiden ȝoure presence

Ther in þe temple of þe goddesse Clemence
we han ben waytynge al þis fourtenight
Now helpe vs lord syn it is in þy might
I wrecche which þat wepe and waylle þus
was whilom wyf to kyng Capaneus
That starf at Thebes cursed be þat day
And alle we þat ben in þis array
And maken alle þis lamentacioun
we leften alle oure housbondes at þe toun
whil þat þe sege þer aboute lay
And ȝet þe olde Creon welaway
That lord is now of thebes þe citee
Fulfilde of Ire and of Iniquite
He for despyt and for his Tyrannye
To do þe deede bodyes vilonye
Of alle oure lordes which þat ben Islawe
Haþ alle þe bodies on an heep ydrawe
And wol not suffren hem by noon assent
Nother to ben yburied nor Ibrent
But makeþ houndes ete hem in despite
And with þat word withoute more respite
They fillen gruf and criden pitously  
haue on vs wrecched wommen som mercy
And lat oure sorwe synken in thyn herte
This gentil duke doun from his courser sterte
with herte pitous whan he herde hem speke
him þoughte þat his herte wolde breke
whan he seyh hem so pitous and so maat
That whilom weren of so gret estat
And in his armes he hem alle vp hente
And hem conforteþ in ful good entente
And swor his oth as he was trewe knight
he wolde do so ferforþly his might
vpon þe tyraunt Creon hem to wreke


That al þe poeple of grece scholde speke
how Creon was of Theseus yserued
As he þat haþ his deth right wel deserued
And right anoon wiþoute eny abood
his baner he desplayeþ and forþ rood
To Thebesward and al his oost bysyde
No ner athenes wolde he go ne ryde
Ne take his eese fully half a day
But onward on his way þat nyght he lay
And sente anoon ypolita þe queene
And Emelye hir ȝonge suster schene
vnto the toun of athenes to dwelle
And forth he ryt þer is no more to telle
The reede statue of mars with spere and targe
So schyneþ in his white baner large
That alle þe feeldes gliteren vp and doun
And by his baner was born his pynoun
Of gold ful riche in which þer was Ibete
The Minatour which þat he slough in Crete
Thus ryt þis Duk þus ryt þis Conquerour
And in his oost of Cheualrie þe flour
Til þat he cam to Thebes and alighte
Faire in a feeld wher as he þoughte to fighte 
But schortly for to speken of þis þing
with Creon which þat was of Thebes kyng
He faught and slough him manly as a knight   
In pleyn bataille and putte his folk to flight
And by assaut he wan þe Cite aftur
And rente doun boþe wal and sparre and raftur
And to þe ladies he restored agayn
The bones of here housbondes þat were slayn
To do exequies as was þo þe gyse
But it were al to long for to deuyse
The grete clamour and þe waymentynge
which þat þe ladies made at þe brennynge
Of þe bodyes and þe grete honour


That Theseus the noble conquerour
Doth to þe ladyes whan þey from him wente
But schortly for to telle is myn entente
whan þat þis worthy Duk þis Theseus
hath Creon slayn and Thebes wonne þus
Stille in þe feelde he took al night his reste
And dide with al þe contre as him leste
TO Ransake in þe cas of bodyes dede
hem for to streepe of herneys and of wede 
The pilours diden businesse and cure
After þe bataile and discomfiture
And so byfil þat in þe cas þei founde
Thurgh girt with many a greuous blody wounde
Two ȝonge knighte liggyng by and by
Boþe in oon armes clad ful richely
Of whiche two Arcite hight þat oon
And þat oþur knight hight Palamon
Nat fully quyk ne fully deed þey were
But by here coote armure and by here gere
Heraudes knewe hem wel in special
As þey þat weren of the blood real
Of Thebes and of Sistren tuo Iborn
Out of þe chaas þe pilours han hem torn
And han hem caried softe vnto þe tente 
Of Theseus and ful sone he hem sente
Tathenes for to dwellen in prisoun
Perpetuelly he wolde no Raunceoun
And þis Duk whan he hadde þus Idoon  
he took his host and hom he ryt anoon
with laurer crowned as a conquerour
And þere he lyueþ in Ioye and in honour
Terme of his lyf what wolle ȝe wordes moo
And in a tour in angwische and in woo ·
This Palamon and his felawe arcite
For euermo þer may no gold hem quyte
This passeþ ȝeer by ȝeer and day by day


Til it fel oones in a morwe of may
That Emelie þat fairer was to seene
Than is þe lilie on hire stalkes grene
And fresscher þan the may with floures newe
For with þe rose colour strof hire hewe
I not which was þe fyner of hem two
Er it was day as sche was wont to do
Sche was arisen and al redy dight
For may wole haue no sloggardye anyght
The sesoun prikeþ euery gentil herte
And makeþ him · out of his sleepe sterte
And seith arys and do þin obseruance
This maked Emelye han remembrance
To do honour to May and for to ryse
Icloþed was sche fressh for to deuyse
hire ȝolwe heer was browdid in a tresse
Byhynde hire bak aȝerde long I gesse
And in the gardyn at þe sonne vpriste
Sche walkeþ vp and doun wher as hire liste
Sche gadereþ floures party whyte and reede
To make a certeyn gerland for hire heede
And as an aungel heuenly sche song
The grete tour þat was so þikke and strong
which of þe castel was the cheef dongeoun
Ther as þis knightes weren in prisoun
Of which I tolde ȝow and telle schal
was euene Ioynyng to þe gardeyn wal
Ther as þis Emely hadde hire pleyynge
Bright was þe sonne and cleer þat morwenynge
And Palamon þis woful prisoner  
As was his wone by leue of his gayler
was risen and romed in a Chambre on heigh
In which he al þe noble cite seigh
And eek þe gardeyn ful of braunches grene
Ther as þe fresshe Emelye þe scheene
was in hire walk and romed vp and doun


This sorweful prisoner þis Palamon
Gooth in þe chambre romyng to and fro
And to himself compleynyng of his woo
That he was born  ful ofte he seyd alas
And so byfel by auenture or cas
That þurgh a wyndow þikke and many a barre
Of Iren greet and squar as eny sparre
he cast his eyen vpon Emelya
And þer with al he bleynte and cryed A
As þat he stongen were vnto þe herte
And with þat crye arcite anon vp sterte
And seyde cosyn myn what eyleþ þe
That art so pale and deedly for to see 
why crydestow who haþ þe doon offence
For goddes loue tak al in pacience
Oure prisoun for it may non oþir be
Fortune haþ ȝeuen vs þis aduersite
Som wikke aspect  or disposicioun
Of Saturne by sum constellacioun
Hath ȝeuen vs þis alþough we hadde it sworn
So stood þe heuen whan þat we were born
we moste endure it þis is þe schort and pleyn
This Palamon answered and seyde ageyn
Cosyn for sothe of þis opynyoun
Thou hast a veyn ymaginacioun
This prisoun caused me not for to crye
But I was hurt right now þurgh myn yhe
Into myn herte þat wol my bane be
The fairnesse of þe lady þat I see
Ȝonde in þe gardyn rome to and fro
Is cause of my cryyng and my wo
I not wheþur sche be womman or goddesse   
But Venus is it sothly as I gesse
And þer with al on knees a doun he fil
And seyde venus if it be ȝoure wil
Ȝow in þis gardyn þus to transfigure


Biforn me sorwful wrecched creature
Out of þis prisoun help þat we may scape
And if so be oure destyne be schape
By eterne word to deyen in prisoun
Of oure lynage haueth sum compassioun
That is so lowe ybrought by Tyrannye
And with þat word Arcite gan espye
wher as this lady romed to and fro
And with þat sight hire beaute hurt him so
That if þat Palamon was wounded sore
Arcite is hurt as moche as he or more
And with a sigh he seyde pitously
The freissche beaute sleeth me sodeynly
Of hir that rometh ȝonder in þe place
And but I haue hir mercy and hir grace
That I may see hir atte leste weye
I nam but deed  ther nys no more to seye
This Palamon whan he tho wordes herde
Dispitously he loked and answerde
whether seistow in ernest or in pley
Nay quoþ Arcite in ernest in good fey
God helpe me so me lust ful euele pleye
This Palamon gan knytte his browes tweye
Hit nere quod he to the no gret honour
For to be fals ne for to be traytour
To me that am thy cosyn and thy broþer
Iswore ful deepe and ech of vs to oþer
That neuer for to deyen in þe payne
Til þat deeth departe schal vs twayne
Neyþer of vs in lande to hynder other
Ne in non other cas  my leeue broþer
But þou schuldest trewly forþer me
In euery caas and I schal forþer þe 
This was þyn othe  and myn eek certayn  
I wot right wel þou darst it nat wiþsayn
Thus art þou of my counseil out of doute


And now thou woldest falsly ben aboute
To loue my lady whom I loue and serue
And euere schal vnto myn herte sterue
Now certes fals arcite þou schal not so
I loued hir first  and tolde the my woo
As to my counseil  and to broþer sworn
To forthere me as I haue told biforn
For which thou art Ibounden as a knight
To helpe me if it lay in þi might
Or elles art þou fals I dar wel sayn
This Arcite ful proudly spak agayn
Thou schalt quoþ he be rather fals þan I
But þou art fals  I telle þe vttirly
For paramour I loued hir first þen þow
what wolt þou sayn thou wost it not ȝit now
wheþer sche be a womman or goddesse
Thyn is affeccioun of holynesse
And myn is loue as of a creature
For which I tolde þe myn aduenture
As to my cosyn  and my broþer sworn
I pose þat þou louedest hire biforn
wost þou nat wel the olde clerkes saw
That who schal ȝeue a louer eny lawe
loue is a grettere lawe by my pan
Then may be ȝeue  to eny erþly man
Therfore posityf lawe and such decre
Is broke alway for love in ech degree
A man moot needes loue maugre his heed
he may nought fle it þough he schulde be deed
Al be sche mayde or be sche widewe or wyf
And þat is nat likly al þy lyf
To stonden in hire grace no more schal I
For wel þou wost þy seluen verrily
That þou and I been dampned to prisoun
Perpetuelly vs gayneth no Raunsoun
We stryue as doth the houndes for the boon  

They foughte alday and ȝit here part was noon
Ther com a kyte whil þat þey were wroþe
That bar awey the boon bitwixe hem boþe
And þerfore at the kynges court my broþer
Eche man for himself þer is non other
Loue if the list for I loue and ay schal
And sothly leeue brother þis is al
Eke in þis prisoun moote we endure
And euery of vs take his auenture
Gret was the stryf and long bytwixe hem tweye
Ȝif þat I hadde leysir for to seye
But to the effect it happed on a day
To telle it ȝow as schortly as I may
A worþy Duk þat highte Perotheus
That felaw was to þe duk Theseus
Syn þilke day þat þey were children lyte
Was come to Athenes his felawe to visite
And for to pley as he was wont to do
For in þis world he loued noman so
And he loued him as tendurly agayn
So wel þey loued as olde bookes sayn
That whan oon  was deed soþly to telle
his felawe wente and sought him doun in helle
But of þat story lyst me nought to write
Duk Perotheus loued wel Arcite
And hadde him knowe at Thebes ȝeer by ȝeer
And fynally at requeste and prayer
Of Perotheus withoute any raunsoun
Duk Theseus him leet out of prisoun
Frely to go wher him lust ouer al
In such a gyse as I ȝou telle schal
This was the forward playnly to endite
Bitwixe Theseus and him Arcite
That if so were þat Arcite were founde
Euere in his lyf by daye night or stounde
In eny contre of þis Theseus


And he were caught it was acorded thus
That with a swerd he scholde lese his heed  
Ther nas noon oþer remedy ne reed
But took his leeue and homward he him spedde
Lete him be war his nekke liþ to wedde
HOw gret a sorwe suffreþ now Arcite
The deþ he feleþ þorugh his herte smyte
He weepeth weyleth cryeth pitously
To slen himself he wayteþ pryuyly
he seyde allas þe day þat I was born
Now is my prisoun werse þan was biforn
Now is me schape eternally to dwelle
Nought in purgatorie but in helle
Allas þat euer knewe I Perotheus
For elles had I dweld with Theseus
Ifetered in his prisoun for euere moo
Than had I ben in blis and nat in woo
Oonly þe sight of hir whom þat I serue
Þough þat I hir grace may nat deserue
wold han sufficed right ynough for me
O dere Cosyn Palamon quod he
Þyn is þe victoire of þis auenture
Ful blisfully in prisoun to endure
In prisoun nay certes but in paradys
wel hath fortune ytorned þe dys
That haþ þe sight of hir and I the absence
For possible is  syn þou hast hir presence
And art a knight a worþi and an able
But by som cas syn fortune is chaungable
Thou maist to þy desir somtyme atteyne
But I that am exiled and bareyne
Of alle grace  and in so gret despeir
That þer nys water erthe fyr ne eyr
Ne creature that of hem maked is
That may me helpe ne comfort in þis
wel ought I sterue in wanhope and distresse


Far wel my lyf and al my Iolynesse
Allas why playnen folk so in comune
Of purueance of god or of fortune
That ȝeueth him ful ofte in many a gyse  
wel better þan þei can hemself deuyse
SOm man desireþ for to haue richesse
That cause is of his morthre or gret seeknesse
And som man wolde out of his prisoun fayn
That in his hous is of his mayne slayn
Infinite harmes ben in þis mateere
we wote neuere what þing we preyen heere
we faren as he þat dronke is as a mows
A dronke man wot wel he haþ an hous
But he not nat which þe righte wey is þider
And to a dronke man þe wey is slider
And certes in þis world so faren we
we seeken faste after felicite
But we gon wrong ful ofte trewely
Thus may we seyen alle and namely I
That wende haue had a gret opinioun
That ȝif I mighte skape fro prisoun
Than had I be in ioye and parfyt hele
Ther now I am exiled fro my wele 
Syn þat I may not se ȝow Emelye
I nam but deed ther nys no remedye
Vppon þat oþer syde Palomon
whan he wiste þat arcite was agoon
Such sorwe makeþ þat þe grete tour
Resowneth of his grete ȝollyng and clamour
The pure feteres of his schynes grete
weren of his bitter salte teres wete
Allas quod he arcita cosyn myn
Of al oure strif god woot þe fruyt is þin
Thow walkest now in Thebes at þi large
And of my woo þou ȝeuest litel charge
Thou maiste seen þou hast wysdom and manhede


Assemble al þe folk of oure kynrede
And make a werre so scharpe in þis Cite
That by som auenture or by som trete
Þou mayst hire wynne to lady and to wyf
For whom þat I most nedes leese my lyf
For as by wey of possibilite  
Syn þou art at þi large of prisoun free
And art a lord gret is þin auantage
More þan is myn þat sterue here in a kage
For I moot weepe and weyle whil I lyue
with al þe woo þat prisoun may me ȝyue
And eek with peyne þat loue me ȝeueþ also
And doubleþ al my peyne and al my wo
Ther with þe fuyr of Ielousye vpsterte
wiþinne his brest and hent him by þe herte
So wodly  þat lik was he to byholde
The box tree or þe asschen deed and colde
Tho seyde he O goddes cruel þat gouerne
This world with byndyng and wiþ word eterne
And writen in þe table of Athamaunte
Ȝoure parlement and ȝoure eterne graunte
what is mankynde more to ȝow holde
Than is a scheep þat roukeþ in þe folde
For slayn is man right as anoþer beste
And dwelleþ eek in prisoun and arreste
And haþ seknesse and greet aduersite
And ofte tymes gilteles parde
what gouernaunce is in ȝoure prescience
That gilteles tormenteþ Innocence
And ȝet encreceþ this al my penaunce
That man is bounden to his obseruaunce
For goddes sake to letten of his wille
Ther as a beste may al his lust fulfille
And whan a beste is deed he ne haþ no peyne
But man after his deth moot wepe and pleyne
þough in þis world he haue care and woo


wiþouten doute it may stonde so
The answer of þis I lete to diuinis
But wel I woot þat in þis world gret pyne is
Allas I se a serpent or a þeef
That many a trewe man haþ doon mescheef
Gon at his large and wher him lust may turne
But I moste be in prisoun þurgh saturne
And eek þorugh Iuno Ialous and eke wood  
That haþ destruyed wel neyh al þe blood
Of Thebes wiþ his waste walles wyde 
And venus sleeþ me on þat oþer syde 
For Ielousye and fere of him Arcyte
NOw wol I stynte of Palamon a lite
And lete him stille in his prisoun dwelle
And of arcita for þan wol I telle
The somer passeþ and þe nightes longe
Encrescen double wise the peynes stronge
Bothe of þe lover and þe prisoner
I noot which hath þe wofullere cheer
For schortly for to sey þis Palomon
Perpetuelly is dampned in prisoun
In cheynes and in feteres to be deed
And Arcite is exiled vpon his heed
For eueremo as out of þat contre
Ne neuere mo schal he his lady see
Now louyeres  axe I þis question
who haþ þe worse Arcite or Palomon
That on may se his lady day by day
But in prisoun he moot dwelle alway
That oþer may wher him lust ryde or go
But seen his lady schal he neuer mo
Now deemeth as ȝou luste ȝe þat can
For I wol telle forþ as I bigan


Whan þat arcite to Thebes come was
Ful ofte a day he swelde and seyde alas
For seen his lady schal he neuer mo
And schortly to concluden al his wo
So moche sorwe had neuer creature
That is or schal whil þat þe world wol dure
his sleep his mete his drynk is him byraft
That lene he wexe  and drye as eny schaft
his eyen holwe  grisly to biholde
his hewe falwe and pale as asschen colde
And solitary he was and euer alone
And dwellyng al þe night making his moone
And if he herde song or Instrument  
Then wolde he wepe he mighte nought be stent
So feble were his spirites and so lowe
And chaunged so þat no man couþe knowe
his speche noþer his vois þough men it herde
And in his gir for al þe world he ferde
Nought oonly lyke þe louers maladye
Of hercos but raþer lik manye
Engendrud of humour malencolyk
Byforne in his selle fantastyk
And schortly turned was al vp so doun
Bothe abyt and eek disposicioun
Of him þis woful louere daun arcite
what schulde I alway of his wo endite
whan he endured hadde a ȝeer or tuoo
In þis cruel torment peyne and woo
At Thebes in his contre as I seyde
vpon a night in sleep as he him leyde
him þought þat how þe venged god mercurie 
Byforn him stood and bad him to be murye
his slepy ȝerd in hond he bar vp right
An hat he wered vpon his heres bright 


Arrayed was þis god as he took keepe
As he was whan þat Argous took his sleep
And seyde to athenes schalt þou wende
Ther is þe schapen of þy wo an ende
And with þat word arcite wook and sterte
Now trewely how sore þat me smerte
Quod he to athenes riȝt now wol I fare
Ne for þe drede of deth schal I not spare
To see my lady þat I loue and serue
In hire presence I recche nat to sterue 
And with þat word he caught a gret myrour
And saugh þat chaunged was al his colour
And saugh his visage was in anoþer kynge
And right anoon it ran him into mynde
That seþþen his face was so disfigured
Of maladie the which he haþ endured
he mighte wel if þat he bar him lowe  
lyue in athenes eueremore vnknowe
And see his lady wel neih day by day
And right anon he chaunged his aray
And cloþed him as a pore laborer
And al alone saue oonly a squyer
That knew his pryuyte and al his cas
which was disgysed pourely as he was
To athenes is he go þe nexte way
And to þe court  he went vpon a day
And at þe ȝate he profred his seruyse
To drugge and drawe what so men wolde deuyse
And schortly on þis matier for to seyn
he fel in office with a Chambirleyn
The which that dwellyng was with Emelye
For he was wys and couthe sone aspye
Of euery seruaunt which þat serued here
wel couþe he hewe woode and water bere 
For he was ȝonge and mighty for þe nones
And þerto he was long and bygge of bones


To doon þat eny wight can him deuyse
A ȝeer or two he was in þis seruise
Page of þe chambre of Emelye þe bright
And Philostrate he seide þat he hight
But half so wel byloued a man as he
Ne was þer neuer in court of his degree
he was so gentil of his condicioun
That þoruh out al þe court was his renoun
They seyde þat it were a charite
That Theseus would enhaunsen his degree
And putten him in worschipful seruyse
Ther as he might his vertu excersise
And þus wiþinne a while his name spronge
Boþe of his dedes and of goode tonge
That Theseus haþ taken him so neer
That of his Chambre he made him squyer
And ȝaf him gold to mayntene his degree
And eek men brought him out of his countre
From ȝeer to ȝer ful pryuyly his rente  
But honestly and sleighly he it spente
That no man wondred how þat he it hadde
And þre ȝeer in þis wise his lyf he ladde
And bar him so in pees and eek in werre
Ther nas no man þat Theseus haþ so derre
And in þis blisse lete I now Arcite
And speke I wole of Palomon alyte
IN derknes and orrible and strong prisoun
This seuen ȝeer haþ seten Palomoun
Forpyned what for woo and for destresse
Who feleþ double sorwe and heuynesse
But Palamon þat loue destreyneþ so
That wood out of his witt he goþ for wo
And eek þerto he is a prisoner
Perpetuelly nat oonly for a ȝeer
Who couþe ryme in englissch propurly
His martirdam forsoþe it am nat I


Therfore I passe as lightly as I may
hit fel þat in þe seuenþe ȝeer in May
The þridde night as olde bookes seyn
That al þis storie tellen more pleyn
were it by auenture or destene
As whan a þing is schapen it schal be
That soone aftur þe mydnyght Palamoun
By helpyng of a freend brak his prisoun
And fleeth þe cite fast as he may goo
For he had ȝiue drinke his gayler soo
Of a clarre maad of certeyn wyn
with nercotykes and opye of Thebes fyn
That al þat night þough þat men wolde him schake
The gayler sleep he mighte nouȝt awake
And þus he fleeþ as fast as euer he may
The night was schort and faste by þe day
That needes cost he moste himseluen hyde
And til a groue ther faste besyde
with dredful foot þan stalkeþ Palomoun
For schortly þis  was his opynyoun
That in þat groue he wolde him hyde al day  
And in þe night þen wolde he take his way
To Thebesward his frendes for to preye
On Theseus to helpe him to werreye 
And shortelich or he wolde lese his lyf
Or wynnen Emelye vnto his wyf
This is þeffect of his entente playn
Now wol I torne vnto Arcite agayn
That litel wiste how nyh þat was his care
Til þat fortune haþ brought him in the snare
The busy larke messager of May
Salueþ in hire song þe morwe gray
And fyry Phebus ryseþ vp so bright
That þe orient laugheþ of þe light
And wiþ his stremes dryeþ in þe greues
The siluer dropes hongyng in þe leeues


And arcite þat is in þe court ryal
With Theseus his Squyer principal
Is risen and loketh on þe mery day
And for to doon his obseruance to May
Remembryng of þe poynt of his desire
he on his courser stertyng as þe fire
Is riden in to feeldes him to pleye
Out of þe court were it a myle or tweye
And to þe groue of which þat I ȝow tolde
By auenture his wey he gan to holde
To make him a garland of þe greues
were it of woodewynde or hawþorn leues
And lowde he song aȝens þe sonne scheene
May wiþ al þyn floures and þy greene
welcome be þou wel faire freissche may
In hope þat I som grene gete may
And fro his courser wiþ a lusty herte
Into þe groue ful lustily he sterte
And in a pathe he romed vp and doun
Ther by auenture þis Palamoun
was in a busche þat no man might him see
Ful sore afered of his deþ was he
No þing ne knew he þat it was Arcite  
God wot he wolde haue trowed it ful lite
But soþ is seyde goon ful many ȝeres
That feld haþ eyen and þe woode haþ eeres
It is ful fair a man to bere him euene
For al day men meteþ atte vnset steuene
Ful litel woot arcite of his felawe
That was so neih to herken of his sawe
For in þe busche he stynteþ now ful stille
whan þat arcyte had romed al his fille 
And songen al þe Roundel lustily
In to a studie he fel sodeynly
As doþ þes louers in here queynte geeres
Now in þe croppe  now doun in þe breres


Now vp now doun as boket in a welle
Right as þe friday soþly for to telle 
Now it schyneþ now it reyneþ faste
Right so gan gery venus ouercaste
The hertes of hire folk right as hir day
Is grisful right so chaungeþ hire aray
Selde is þe fryday al þe wyke Ilike
whan þat arcite hadde songe he gan to sike
And sette him doun wiþouten eny more
Alas quod he þat day þat I was bore
how longe Iuno thurgh þy cruelte
wiltow werreyen Thebes þe Citee
Allas Ibrought is to confusioun
The blood royal of Cadme and Amphioun
Of Cadynus  þe which was þe furst man
That Thebes bulde or first þe toun bygan
And of þat Cite first was crowned kyng
Of his lynage  am I and his ofspring
By verray line and of his stok ryal
And now I am so caytyf and so þral
That he þat is my mortal enemy
I serue him as his squyer pourely
And ȝet doth Iuno me wel more schame
For I dar nought byknowe myn owne name
But þer as I was wont to hote arcite  
Now hoote I Philostrate nouȝt worth a myte
Allas þou felle mars allas Iuno
Thus haþ ȝoure Ire owre lynage fordo
Saue oonly me and wrecchid Palomoun
That Theseus martyreþ in prisoun
And ouer al this to slee me vtterly
Loue haþ his fyry dart so brennyngly
I stykid þorugh my trewe careful herte
That schapen was my deth erst þan my scherte
Ȝe slen me with ȝoure eyhen Emelye
Ȝe ben þe cause wherfore þat I dye


Of al þe remenant of al myn oþer care
Ne sette I nouȝt þe mountaunce of a tare
So þat I couþe do ought to ȝoure pleasaunce
And with þat word he fel doun in a traunce
A longe tyme and aftirward vpsterte
This Palamon þat þouȝte þurgh his herte
he felt a cold swerd sodeynliche glyde
For Ire he quook he nolde no lenger abyde
And whan þat he haþ herd arcites tale
As he were wood wiþ face deed and pale
he sterte him vp out of þe bussches þikke
And seyd arcyte  false traitour wikke
Now art þou hent þat louest my lady so
For whom þat I haue al þis peyne and wo
And art my blood and to my counseil sworn
And I ful ofte haue told þe heere byforn
And hast byIaped here þe duke Theseus
And falsly chaunged hast þy name þus
I wol be deed or elles þou schalt dye
Þou schalt not loue my lady Emelye
But I wil loue hire oonly and nomo
For I am Palomon þy mortal fo
And þough þat I no wepen haue in þis place
But out of prisoun am ystert by grace
I drede not þat oþer þou schalt dye
Or þou ne schalt not loue Emelye
Chese which þou wilt for þou schalt not asterte  
This arcite with ful despitous herte
whan he him knew and had his tale herde
As fers as a lyoun pulleþ out a swerde
And seide þus by god þat sitteþ aboue
Nere it þat þou art sike and wood for loue
And eek þat þou no wepne has in þis place
But out of prisoun art ystert by grace
That þou ne schuldest deyen of myn hond
For I defye þe seurte and þe bond


which þat þou seyst I haue maad to þe
For verray fool  þenk þat loue is fre
And I wol loue hire mawgre al þy might
But for þou art a gentil parfiȝt knight
And wenest to dereyne hire by batayle
haue heere my trouþe to morwe I nyl not fayle
wiþouten wityng of eny oþer wight
That heer I wol be founden as a knight
And bryngen harneys right Inough for þe
And ches þe best and lef þe worst for me
And mete and drynke þis night wil I bryng
Inough for þe and cloþ for þy beddyng
And if so be þat þou my lady wynne
And sle me in þis wood þat I am Inne
Thou maist wel haue þy lady as for me
This Palomon answereþ I graunt it þe
And þus þey ben departed til a morwe
whan ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe
OCupide  out of al charite
O regne þat wolt no felaw haue with þe
Ful soþ is seyde  þat loue ne lordschipe
wol not his þonkes haue no felaschipe
wel fynden þat arcite and Palamoun
Arcite is riden anon to þe toun
And on þe morwe or it were day light
Ful priuely two harneys haþ he dight
Boþe sufficaunt and mete to darreyne
The batayl in þe feeld betwix hem tweyne
And on his hors alone as he was born  
he caryed al þis harneys him byforn
And in þe groue at tyme and place Isette
This arcite and þis Palamon ben mette
Tho chaungen gan here colour in here face
Right as þe honterus in þe regne of Trace
That stondeþ in þe gappe with a spere
whan honted is þe lyoun or þe bere


And hereþ him  comyng in þe greues
And brekeþ boþe þe bowes and þe leues
And þenkeþ here comeþ my mortel enemy
wiþoute faile he mot be deed or I
For eyþer I mot slen him at þe gappe
Or he moot slee me if it me myshappe
So ferden þey in chaungyng of here hew
AS fer as eyþer of hem oþer knew
Ther nas no good day ne no saluyng
But streyt wiþouten wordes rehersyng
Euery of hem helpeþ to armen oþer
As frendly as he were his owen broþer
And þanne wiþ  here scharpe speres stronge
They foyneden ech at oþer longe
Tho it semed þat þis Palomon
In his fightyng were a wood lyoun
And as a cruel tygre was arcite
And as wilde boores gonne þey smyte
That froþen white as fome froþe wood
vp to þe ancle þey faught in here blood
And in þis wise I lete hem fiȝtyng welle
And forþere I wol of Theseus telle
The destyne mynistre general
That excused in þe world ouer al
The purueans þat god haþ seye byforn
So strong it is þat þey þe world had sworn
The contrary of a þing by ȝe or nay
Ȝet som tyme it schal falle vpon a day
That falleþ nought eft in a þousend ȝeere
For certeynly oure appetites heere
Be it of pees oþer hate or loue  
Al is it reuled by þe sight aboue
This mene I now by mighty Theseus
That for to honte is so desirous
And namely þe grete hert in May
That in his bed þer daweth him no day


That he nys clad and redy for to ryde
with hont and horn and houndes him byside
For in his hontyng haþ he such delyt
That is his ioye and his appetyt
To been him self þe grete hertes bane
For after may he serueþ now Dyane
Cleer was þe day as I haue told or þis
And Theseus with alle Ioye and blys
with his ypolita þe fayre queene
And Emelye cloþed al in greene
On hontyng be þay riden ryally
And to þe groue þat stood þer faste by
In which þer was an hert as men him tolde
Duk Theseus þe streyte wey haþ holde
And to þe launde he rydeþ him ful right
There was þe hert ywont to haue his flight
And ouer a brook and so forþ in his weye
This duk wol haue of him a cours or tweye
wiþ houndes which as him lust to comaunde
And whan þis Duk was come in to þe launde
vnder þe sonne he lokeþ right anon
he was war of arcite and Palomon
That foughten breeme as it were boores tuo
The brighte swerdes wente to and fro
So hidously þat with þe leste strook
It seemeþ as it wolde felle an Ook
But what þey were noþing ȝit he woot
This duk wiþ spores  his courser he smoot
And at a stert he was bitwix hem tuoo
And pullid out a swerd and cride hoo
Nomore vp peyne  of leesyng of ȝour heed
By mighty mars anon he schal be deed
That smyteþ eny strook þat I may seen  
But telleþ me what mestir men ȝe been
That ben so hardy for to fighten heere
wiþoute Iugge or oþer officere


As it were in a lyste really
This Palamon answerde hastily
And seyde sire what nedeþ wordes mo
we han þe deþ deserued boþe tuo
Tuo woful wrecches been we and kaytyues
That ben encombred of oure owne lyues
And as þou art a rightful lord and Iuge
Ne ȝeue vs neyþer mercy ne refuge
But sle me first for seynte Charite
But sle my felaw eek as wel as me
Or sle him first for þough þou knowe him lyte
This is þy mortal fo þis is arcite
Þat fro þy lond is banyscht on his heed
For which he haþ Iserued to be deed
For þis is he þat come to þi gate
And seyde þat  he highte Philostrate
Thus haþ he Iaped þe many a yer
And þou hast maad of him þy cheef squyer
And þis is he þat loueth Emelye
For siþ þe day is come þat I schal dye
I make pleynly my confessioun
Þat I am  þe woful Palamoun
That haþ þi prisoun broke wikkedly
I am þy mortal foo and it am I
That loueþ so hoote  Emely þe bright
That I wol dye present in hire sight
Therfore I aske deeþ and my Iuwyse
But slee my felaw in þe same wyse
For boþe we haue serued to be slayn
This worthy duk answerde anon agayn
And seide þis is  a schort conclusioun
Ȝour owne mouþ by ȝour owne confessioun
haþ dempned ȝou boþe  and I wil it recorde
It needeþ nouȝt to pyne ȝow wiþ þe corde
Ȝe schul be deed by mighty mars þe reede  
The queen anon for verray wommanhede


Gan for to wepe and so dede Emelye
And alle þe ladies in companye
Great pite was it as it þought hem alle
That euere such a chaunce schulde falle
For gentil men þei were and of gret estate
And noþing but for loue was þis debate
And saw here bloody woundes wyde and sore
And alle þey cryde lesse and þe more
Haue mercy lord vpon vs wommen alle
And on here bare knees anoon þey falle
And wolde haue kissed his bare feet right as he stood
Till atte laste aslaked was his mood
For pite renneþ sone in gentil herte
And þough he for Ire quok and sterte
he haþ it al considered in a clause
The trespas of hem boþe and here cause
And alþough his Ire here gylt accused
Ȝet he in his resoun hem boþe excused
And þus he þought þat euery maner man
wol help himself in loue if þat he can
And eek delyuer himself out of prisoun
And eek in his hert had compassioun
Of wommen for þey wepen euer in oon
And in his gentil hert he þought anoon
And soþly he to himself seyde fy
vpon a lord þat wol haue no mercy
But be a lyoun boþe in word in dede
To hem þat ben in repentaunce and drede
As wel as to a proud dispitious man
That wol maynteyne þat he first bigan
That lord haþ litel of discrecioun
That in such caas can no diuisioun
But wayteþ pride and humblenesse after oon
And schortly whan his Ire is ouer gon
He gan to loke on hem with eyen blake and light
And spak þese same wordes al in hight


The god of loue a benedicite  
how mighty and how gret a lord is he
Agayns his might þer gayneth non obstacle
He may be cleped a god of his miracle
For he can maken at his owen gyse
Of euery herte  as him lust deuyse
Lo her is arcite and Palomon
That quytely  were out of my prisoun
And might haue lyued in Thebes ryally
And witen I am here mortal enemy
And þat here deþ lith in my might also
And ȝet haþ loue maugre here eyȝen tuo
Ibrought hem hider boþe for to dye
Now lokeþ is nat þat an heih folye
who may be a fole if þat he loue
Byholde for goddes þaþ sitteþ aboue
Se how þey blede be þey nought wel arrayed
Thus haþ here lord þe god of loue hem payed
here wages and here fees for here seruise
And ȝet wenen they to ben wise 
That seruen loue for ought þat may bifalle
But þis is ȝette  þe beste game of alle
That sche for whom þey haue þis Ielousye
 Can hem þerfore as moche þank as me
Sche woot no more of al þis hoote fare
By god þan wot a Cuckow or an hare
But al moot ben assayed hoot or colde
A man moot ben a fool oþer ȝong or olde
I woot it by my self ful ȝore agon
For in my tyme a seruant was I on
And sythen þat I knewe of loues peyne
And wot how sore it can a man destreyne
As he þat haþ often ben caught in his lace
I ȝou forȝeue holly þis trespace
At þe request of þe queen þat kneleþ heere
And eek of Emely my suster deere


And ȝe schullen boþe anon vnto me swere
That neuer ȝe schullen my corowne dere
Ne make werre on me night ne day  
But be my freendes alle þat ȝe may
I ȝou forȝeue þis trespas euery dele
And þey him swore his axyng euery dele
And him of lordschip and of mercy prayde
And he hem graunted mercy and þus he sayde
TO speke of real lynage and riches
Though þat sche were a queen or a prynces
Ilk of ȝow boþe is worþy douteles
To wedde when tyme is but naþeles
I speke as for my suster Emelye
For whom ȝe haue þis stryf and Ielousye
ȝe woot ȝoure self sche may not wedde two
At oones þough ȝe faughten euer mo
That oon of ȝow or be him loth or leef
he may go pypen in an Iuy leef
This is to say sche may nought haue boþe
Al be ȝe neuer so Ielous ne so loþe
Forþy I put ȝou bothe in þis degre
That ilk of ȝou schal haue his destyne
As him is schape  and herken in what wyse
Lo here ȝour ende of þat I schal deuyse
My wil is þis for playn conclusioun
wiþouten eny repplicacioun
If þat ȝou liketh tak it for þe best
That euery of ȝou schal go wher him lest
Frely wiþouten raunsoun or daungeer
And þis day fyfty wykes fer ne neer
Euerich of ȝou schal bryng an hundred knightes
Armed for lystes vp at alle rightes
Al redy to derayne hir by batayle
And þus byhote I ȝou wiþouten fayle
vpon my trouthe and as I am a knight
That wheþir of ȝow boþe þat haþ might


This is to seyn that wheþir he or þou
May wiþ his hundred as I spak of now
Sle his contrary or out of lystes dryue
Him schal I ȝeue Emelye to wyue
To whom þat fortune ȝeueþ so fair a grace  
The lyste schal I make in þis place
And god so wisly on my sowle rewe
As I schal euen iuge ben and trewe
ȝe schul non oþir ende wiþ me make
That oon of ȝow schal be deed or take
And if ȝou þinkeþ þis is wel Isayde
Say ȝoure avys and holdeþ ȝow apayde
This is ȝoure ende and ȝoure conclusioun
who lokeþ lightly now but Palamoun
who spryngeþ vp for ioye but arcite
who couþe telle or who couþe endite
The ioye þat is made in þis place
whan Theseus haþ don so fair a grace
But down on knees wente euery wight
And þanked him with al here hertes might
And namely þe thebanes ofte siþe
And þus wiþ good hope and herte bliþe
They taken here leue and homward þey ryde
To Thebes  wiþ olde walles wyde
    
ATrow men wolde  it deme necligence
If I forȝete to telle þe dispence
Of Theseus þat goþ so busily
To maken vp þe lystes rially
and such a noble theatre as it was
I dar wel say þat in þis world þer nas
The circuite þer was a myle aboute
walled of stoon and dyched al wiþoute
Round was þe schap in maner of compaas


Ful of degre þe height of sixty paas
That whan a man was set in o degre
he letted nought his felaw for to se
Estward þer stood a gate of marbul whit
westward such anoþer in opposit
And schortly to conclude such a place
was non in erþe in so litel space
In al þe lond þer nas no craftys man
That geometry or arsmetrike can
Ne purtreyour ne keruer of ymages  
That Theseus ne ȝaf hem mete and wages
The theatre for to maken and deuyse
And for to don his right and sacrifise
he Estward haþ vpon þe gate aboue
In worschip of venus goddes of loue
Don make an auter and an oratory
And westward in þe mynde and in memory
Of mars he haþ Imaked such an oþer
That coste largely of gold a foþer
And northward in a toret on þe walle
Of alabaster whit and reed coralle
An oratory riche for to see
In worschip of Dyane goddes of chastite
hath Theseus Iwrought in noble wise
But ȝit had I forgeten to deuyse 
The nobil keruyng and þe purtretures
The schap þe contynaunce of þe figures
That weren in þe Oratories þre
Furst in þe temple of venus þou may se
wrought in þe wal ful pitous to byholde
Thre broken slepes and þe sykes colde
The sacred teeres and þe waymentyng
The fuyry strokes and þe desiryng
That loues servauntȝ in þis lyf enduren
The othes þat by her couenantȝ assuren
Plesance and hope desyr foolhardynesse


Beaute and ȝouþe baudery and richesse
Charmes and sorcery lesynges and flatery
Dispense busynes and Ielousy
That werud of ȝolo guldes a gerland
And a cukkow sittyng on hire hand
Festes instrumentȝ carols and daunces
Lust and array and al þe circumstaunces 
Of loue which I rekned and reken schal
Ech by oþer  were peynted on þe wal
And mo þan I  can make of mencioun
For sothly al þe mount of Setheroun
Ther Venus hath hir principal dwellyng  
was schewed on þe wal here portrayng
wiþ alle þe Gardyn and al þe lustynes
Nought was forȝete þe porter ydelnes
Ne Narcisus þe fayr of ȝore agon
Ne ȝet þe foly of kyng Salomon
Ne eek þe strengþe  of him hercules
Thenchauntementȝ of Medea and Cerces
Ne of turnus of which þe hard fuyry corage
The riche Cresus caytif in seruage
Thus may we see þat wisdom and riches
Beaute ne sleight strengþe ne hardynes
Ne may wiþ venus holde champartye
For as sche lust þe world þan may sche gye
lo al þis folk Icaught were in hire trace
Til þay for wo fuloften sayde allas
Sufficeþ þis ensample oon or tuo
And þough I couþe reken a þousend mo
The statu of venus glorious for to see
was naked fletyng in þe large see
And fro þe nauel doun al couered was
with wawes grene as bright as eny glas
A citole in hire right hond hadde sche
And on hir heed ful semely on to see
A rose garland ful swete and wel smellyng


And abouen hire heed dowues fleyng
Biforn hir stood hir sone Cupido
vpon his schuldres were wynges two
And blynd he was as it is often seene
A bowe he bar and arwes fair and greene
Why schuld I nouȝt as wel telle ȝou alle
The portraiture þat was vpon þe walle
wiþ in þe temple of mighty mars þe reede
Al peynted was þe wal in lengþ and breede
loke to þe Estres of þe grisly place
That hight þe gret tempul of mars in trace
In þat colde and in þat frosty regioun
Ther as mars haþ his souereyn mancioun
First on þe wal was peynted a foreste  
In which þer dwelled neyther man ne beste 
wiþ knotty knarry bareyn trees olde
Of stubbes scharpe and hidous to byholde
In which þer ran as wymbul in a swough
As it were a storme schuld berst euery bough
And downward on an hil vnder a bent 
Ther stood þe tempul of marcȝ armypotent 
wrought al of burned steel of which þentre
was long and streyt and gastly for to see
And þer out came a rage of suche aprise
That it maad al þe gates for to rise
The norþen light in at þe dore schon
For wyndow on þe walle was þer noon
Thorugh þe which men might no light discerne
The dores wer alle ademauntȝ eterne
Iclenched ouer thward and endelong
with Iren tough  and for to make it strong
Euery piler þe tempul to susteene
was tonne greet of Iren bright and schene
Ther saugh I furst þe derk ymaginyng
Of felony and al the compassyng
The cruel Ire as reed as eny gleede


The pikepurs and eek þe pale drede
The smyler wiþ þe knyf vnder his cloke
The schipne brennyng with þe blake smoke
The tresoun of þe murþeryng in þe bed
The open werres wiþ woundes al bibled
kuttud with bloody knyf and scharp manace
Al ful of chirkyng was þat sory place
The sleer of himself ȝet saugh I þere
here herte blood haþ baþed al his here
The nayl ydryue in þe schode anyght
The colde deþ with mouþ gapyng vpright
Amyddes of þe tempul set meschaunce
wiþ sory comfort and euel contynaunce
I saugh woundes laughyng in here rage
The hunt strangled with wilde bores corage
    
    
    
    
    
    
The sowe freten þe child right in þe cradel  
The cook Iskalded for al his longe ladel
Nought beþ forgeten þe infortune of mart
The carter ouerryden wiþ his cart
vnder þe whel ful lowe he lay a doun
Ther were also of martȝ diuisioun
The barbour and þe bowcher and þe smyth
That forgeþ scharpe swerdes on his stith
And al aboue depeynted in a tour
Saw I conquest sittyng in gret honour
with þe scharpe swerd ouer his heed
hangynge by a sotil twyne threed
Depeynted was þer þe slaught of Iulius
Of grete Nero and of Anthonius
Al be þat ilke tyme þey were vnborn


Ȝet was here deth depeynted þer byforn
By manasyng of marcȝ right by figure
So was it schewed right in þe purtreture
As is depeynted in sterres aboue
who schal be slayn or elles deed for loue
Sufficeþ oon ensample in stories olde


The statue of mars vpon a carte stood
Armed and loked grym as he were wood
And ouer his heed þer schyneþ two figures
Of sterres þat been cleped in scriptures
That oon puella þat oþur Rubius
This god of armes was arayed þus
A wolf þer stood byforn him at his feet
wiþ eyen reed and of a man he eet
wiþ sotyl pencel depeynted was þis storie
In redoutyng of mars and of his glorie
NOw to þe temple of Dyane þe chaste
As schortly as I can I wol me haste
To telle ȝou al þe descripcioun
Depeynted ben þe walles vp and doun
Of huntyng and of schamefast chastite
Ther saugh I how woful Calystope 
whan þat Dyane was agreued with here  
was turned from a womman to a bere
And after was sche maad þe loodesterre
Thus was it peynted I can say no ferre
hire son is eek aftir as men may see
Ther sawȝ I dyane turned in til a tree
I mene nouȝt þe goddes Dyane
But Peneus douȝter  þe whiche hight dane
Ther saugh I atheon an hert Imaked
For vengance þat he saugh Dyane al naked
I saugh how þat his houndes han him caught
And freten him for þat þey knew him naught
Ȝit Ipeynted was a litel forþer more


how atthalaunce huntyd þe wilde bore
And Melyagre  and many anoþer mo
For which Dyane wrought him care and woo
Ther saugh I eek many anoþer story
The which me list not drawe in to memory
This goddess son  an hert ful hy he seet
with smale houndes at hire feet
And vnderneþe hir feet sche had þe moone
wexyng it was and schulde wane soone
In gaude greene hire statue cloþed was
wiþ bowe in hande and arwes in a cas
hir eyȝen caste sche ful lowe adoun
Ther Pluto haþ his derke regioun
A womman trauailyng was hire biforn
But for hire child so longe was vnborn
Ful pitously lucyna gan she calle
And seyde help  for þou mayst best of alle 
wel couþe he peynte lyfly þat it wrouȝt
wiþ many a floren he þe hewes bought
Now been þise listes maad and Theseus 
That at his grete cost arayed þus
The temples and þe Theatres euery del
whan it was don it liked him right wel
But stynt I wil of Theseus a lite
And speke of Palomon and of Arcite
THe day approcheþ of her attournyng  
That euery schuld an hundred kniȝtes bryng
The batail to derreyne as I ȝou tolde
And til athenes her couenant to holde
hath euery of hem brought an C knightes
wel armed for þe werre at alle rightes
And sikerly þer trowed many a man
That  neuer siþþen þat þis world bigan
For to speke of knighthod of her hond
As fer as god haþ maked see or lond
Nas of so fewe so good a company


For euery wight þat loueþ chyualry
And wold his þankes haue a passant name
he preyed þat he might be of þat game
A wel was him þat þerto chosen was
For if þer felle to morwe such a caas
I knowe wel þat euery lusty knight
That loueþ paramours and hath his might
were it in Engelond or elles where 
They wold here þankes wilne to be þere
To fight for  a lady benedicite
It were a lusty sighte for to see
And right so ferden þey with Palomon
wiþ him þer wente knyghtes many oon
Some wol ben armed in an haburgoun
In a bright brest plat and a gypoun
And som wold haue a peyre plates large
And som wold haue a prys scheld or a targe
Som wol been armed on here legges weel
And haue an ax and eek a mace of steel
Ther nys no newe gyse þat it nas old
Armed were þey as I haue told
Euerich after his owen opinioun
Ther maistow se comyng wiþ Palomoun
ligurge himself þe grete kyng of Trace
Blak was his berd and manly was his face
The cercles of  his eyen in his heed
They gloweden bytwixe ȝolw and reed
And lik a griffoun loked he aboute  
with kempe heres on his browes stowte
his lymes greet his brawnes hard and stronge
his schuldres brood his armes rounde and longe
And as þe gyse was in his contre
Ful heye vpon a chare of gold stood he
wiþ foure white boles in a trays
In stede of cote armour in his harnays
wiþ nayles ȝolwe and bright as eny gold


he had a bere skyn coleblak for old
his lange heer ykempt byhynd his bak
As eny rauen fether it schon for blak
A wreþe of gold armgret and huge of wight
Vpon his heed set ful of stoones bright
Of fyne rubeus and of fyn dyamauntȝ
Aboute his chare wente with white alauntȝ
Twenty and mo as grete as eny stere
To hunt at þe lyoun or at þe bere
And folwed him with mosel fast Ibounde
Colerd of gold and torettȝ fyled rounde
An hundred lordes had he in his route
Armed ful wel wiþ hertes stern and stoute
With arcita in stories as men fynde
The gret Emetreus þe kyng of ynde
Vppon a steede bay trapped in steel
Couered wiþ cloþ and of gold dyapred wel
Cam rydyng lyk  þe god of armes mars
his coote armour was of a cloþ of Tars
Cowched of perlys whyte round and grete
his sadil was of brend gold newe bete
A mantelet vpon his schuldre hangyng
Bretful of Rubies reed and fir sparclyng
His crispe her lik rynges was Ironne
And þat was ȝalwe and gliteryng as þe sonne
his nose was heigh his eyen were cytryne
His lippes rounde his colour was sangwyn
A fewe freknes in his face yspreynd
Betwixe ȝolwe and somdel blak ymeynd
And as a lyoun he his lokyng caste  
Of fyue and twenty ȝeer his age I caste
his berd was wel bygonne for to sprynge
His voys was as a trumpe thunderynge
vpon his heed he wered a laurer grene
A garlond freisch and lusty for to sene
vpon his hond he bar for his delyt


An Egle tame as eny lylie whyt
An hundred lordes had he with him þer
Al armed sauf here hedes in here ger
Ful richely in alle maner þinges
For trusteþ wel þat dukes Erles kynges
were gadred in þis noble companye
For loue and for encres of Chiualrye 
Aboute þe kyng þer ran on euery part
Ful many a tame lyoun and lepart
And in þis wise þis lordes alle and some
Been on the sonday to þe cite kome
Aboute prime and in þe toun alight
This Theseus þis duk þis worþy knight
whan he had brought hem in to þis cite
And ynned hem euerich at his degre
he festeþ hem and doþ so gret labour
To esen hem and do hem al honour
That ȝit men wene þat no mannes wyt
Of non estat þat cowde amenden it
The mynstralcye þe seruyce at þe feste
The grete ȝiftes to þe most and leste
The riche aray of Thebes his paleys
Ne who sat first ne last vpon þe deys
what ladies fayrest ben or best daunsyng
Or which of hem can daunce best or syng
Ne who most felyngly spekeþ of loue
what haukes sitten on þe perche aboue
what houndes lyen in þe floor adoun
Of al þis make I now no mencioun
But of þeffect þat þinkeþ me þe beste 
Now comth þe poynt and herkneth if ȝou leste
The sonday night or day bigan to springe  
when Palomon þe larke herde synge
Al þough it were nought day by houres tuo
ȝit sang þe larke and Palomon also 
with holy herte and with an heih corage


He roos to wenden on his pilgrymage
Vnto þe blisful Cithera benigne
I mene Venus honorable and digne
And in here hour he walkeþ forþ a paas
Vnto þe lystes þer hir temple was
And doun he kneleþ and wiþ humble cheer
And her sore and seide as ȝe schal heer
FAirest O fairest  O lady myn Venus
Doughter of Ioue and spouse to Vlcanus
Thou glader of þe mount of Citheroun
For þilke loue þou haddest to adeoun
haue pite on my bitter teeres smerte
And tak myn humble prayer to þin herte
Allas I ne haue no langage for to telle
Theffectes ne þe tormentȝ of myn helle
Myn herte may myn harmes nat bewreye
I am so confus þat I may not seye
But mercy lady bright þat knowest wel
My þought and felest what harm þat I fel
Consider al þis and rew vpon my sore
As wisly as I schal for euermore 
Enforce my might þi trewe seruant to be
And holde werre alday wiþ chastite
That make I myn avow so ȝe me helpe
I kepe nat of armes for to ȝelpe
Ne nat I aske to morn to haue victorie
Ne renoun in þis caas ne Veyne glorie
Of pris of armes blowyng vp and doun
But I wolde haue ful possessioun
Of Emelye and dye in þi seruise
Fynd þou þe maner how and in what wyse
I recche nat but it may better be
To haue victorie of him or he of me
So þat I haue my lady in myn armes  
For þough so be þat mars be god of armes
And ȝe be venus þe goddes of loue


Ȝoure vertu is so gret in heuen aboue
Thy temple wol I worschipe euermo
And on þin auter wher I ryde or go
I wol do sacrifice and fyres beete
And if ȝe wol nat so my lady sweete
Than pray I þe to morwe with a spere
That arcita me þurgh the herte bere 
Thanne rekke I nat whan I haue lost my lyf
Though þat arcite haue hir to his wyf
This is þeffect and ende of my prayeere
Ȝif me my love my blisful lady deere
whan thorisoun was doon of Palomon
his sacrifice he dede and þat anoon
Ful pitously with alle circumstances
Al telle I nat as now his obseruances
But at þe last þe statu of venus schook
And made a signe wherby þat he took
That his prayer accepted was þat day
For þough þe signe schewed a delay
Ȝet wist he wel þat graunted was his boone
And wiþ glad herte he went him hom ful soone
The þrid hour in equal þat Palomon
Bigan to Venus temple for to goon
vp roos þe sonne and vp roos Emelye
And to þe temple of Dian gan sche hye
Hir maydens þat sche wiþ hir þider ladde
Ful redily wiþ hem þe fyr þey hadde
Thencens  þe cloþes and þemenant al
That to þe sacrifice longen schal
The hornes ful of meth as is þe gyse 
Ther lakkeþ nouȝt to do here sacrifise
Smokyng þe temple ful of cloþes faire
This Emelye wiþ herte debonaire
Hir body wessch wiþ wtir of a welle
But how sche dide I ne dar nat telle
But it be eny þing in general  

And ȝet it were a game to here it al
To him þat meneth wel it were no charge
But it is good a man be at his large
hir brighte her was kempt vntressed al
A Corone of a grene Ok cerial
vpon hir heed was set ful fair and meete
Tuo fyres on þe auter gan sche beete
And did hir þinges as men may biholde
In state of Thebes and þe bokes olde
whan kynled was þe fyre wiþ pitous cheere 
vnto Dyan sche spak as ȝe may heere
Ochaste goddes of þe woodes greene
To whom boþe heuen and erþe and see is seene
Queen of þe regne of pluto derk and lowe
Goddes of maydenes þat myn hert has knowe
Ful many a ȝeer  ȝe woot what I desire
As keep me fro þe vengans of þilk yre
That atheon aboughte trewely
Chaste goddesse wel wost þou þat I
Desire to ben a mayden al my lyf
Ne neuer wol I be no loue ne wyf
I am ȝit þou wost of þi company
A mayden and loue huntyng and venery
And for to walken in þe woodes wylde
And nought to ben a wyf and be with chylde
Nouȝt wol I knowe þe company of man
Now helpe me lady syþnes ȝe may and kan
For þe formes þat þou hast in þe
And Palomon þat haþ such loue to me
And eek arcite þat loueþ me so sore
This grace I praye þe wiþouten more
And sende loue and pees betwix hem two
And fro me torne a wey here hertes so
That al here hoote loue and here desire
Al here besy torment and al here fyre
Be queynt or turned in anoþer place


And if so be þou wol do me no grace
Or if my destyne be schapid so  
That I schal needes haue on of hem two
So send me him þat most desireþ me
Biholde goddes of clene chastite
The bitter teeres þat on my cheekes falle
Syn þou art mayde and keper of vs alle
My maydenhode þou kepe and wel conserue
And whil I lyue a mayde I wil þe serue 
The fyres bren vpon þe auter cleer
whil Emelye was in hire preyer
But sodeinly sche saugh a sighte queynt
For right anon on of þe fyres queynt
And quyked agayn and after þat anon
That oþer fyr was queynt and al agon
And as it queynt it made a whistelyng
As doþ a wete brond in his brennyng
And at þe brondes end out ran anoon
As it were bloody dropes many oon
For which so sore agast was Emelye
That sche wel neih mad was and gan to crie
For sche ne wiste what it signifyed
But oonely for feere þus sche cryed
And wepte þat it was pite to heere
And þerwiþal Dyane gan appeere
wiþ bow in hond right as a hunteresse
And seyd a doughter stynt þyn heuynesse
Among þe goddes hye it is affermed
And by eterne word write and confermed
Thou schalt be wedded vnto oon of þo
That haue for þe so moche care and wo
But vnto which of hem may I nat telle
Far wel for I may her no lenger dwelle
The fyres which þat on myn auter bren
Schuln þe declare or þat þou go hen
Thyn aduenture of loue and in þis caas


And wiþ þat word þe arwes in þe caas
Of þe goddesse clatren faste and rynge
And forþ sche went and made a vanysschynge
For which this Emelye astoneyd was  
And seide what amounteþ þis allas
I put me vnder þy proteccioun
Dyane and in þi disposicioun
And hoom sche goþ anon þe nexte way
This is þeffect þer nys no mor to say
The nexte houre of mars folwynge þis
Arcite to þe temple walkyd is 
To fyry mars to doon his sacrifise 
with al þe rightes of his payen wise
with pitous herte and heih deuocioun
Right thus to mars he sayd his orisoun
O stronge god þat in þe reynes cold
Of trace honoured and lord art þou hold
And hast in euery regne and euery land
Of armes al þe bridel in þy hand
And hem fortunest as þe lust deuyse
Accept of me my pitous sacrifise
If so be þat my ȝouthe may deserue
And þat my might be worþi to deserue
Thy godhed þat I may be on of þine
Then pray I þe  to rewe on my pyne
For þilke peyne and þat hoote fuyre
The which whilom þou brendest for desyre
whan þat þou vsedest þe gret bewte
Of faire freissche Venus þat is so free
And haddest hir in armes at þy wille
And þough þe ones on a tyme mysfille
whan Vlcanus had caught þe in his laas
And fand þe liggyng by his wyf allaas
For þilke sorwe þat was in þin herte

I am ȝong and vnkonnyng as þou wost


And as I trowe  wiþ loue offendid most 
That euer was eny lyues creature 
For sche þat doth me  al þis wo endure
Ne rekkeþ neuer wheþer I synke or flete
And wel I woot or sche me mercy heete
I moot wiþ strengþe wyn hir in þe place  
And wel I wot wiþouten help or grace
Of þe  ne may my strengthe nought auayle
Then help me lord to morn in my batayle
For þilke fyr that whilom brende þe
As wel as þis fire now brenneþ me
And do to morn þat I haue þe victorie
Myn be þe trauail al þin be þe glorie
Thy souerein tempul wol I most honouren
Of any place  and al way most labouren
In þy plesaunce  and þy craftes strong
And in þy tempul I wol my baner hong
And alle þe armes of my companye
And euermore vnto þat day I dye
Eterne fyr I wol bifore þe fynde
And eek to þis  avow I wol me bynde
My berd myn heer þat hangeth longe a doun
That neuer ȝit ne felt offensioun
Of rasour ne of schere I wol þe ȝiue
And be þy trewe seruaunt whiles I lyue

The preyer stynt of Arcita þe strange
The rynges on þe tempul dore þat hange
And eek the dores clatereden ful fast
Of which arcita som what was agast
The fires brenden on þe auter bright
That it gan al þe tempul for to light
A swote smel anon þe ground vp ȝaf
And arcita anon his hand vp haf
And more encens in to þe fyr ȝet cast

And with þat soun  he herd a murmuryng
Ful lowe and dym  and sayde þis victorie
For which he ȝaf to mars honour and glorie
And þus with ioye and hope wel to fare
Arcite anoon  vnto his Inne is fare 
As fayn as foul is of þe brighte sonne  
And right anon such stryf is bygonne
For þat grauntyng in þe heuen aboue

And soþ is sayd eelde haþ gret auantage

Al be it þat  it be agayns his kynde
Of al þis stryf he can remedy fynde

Som seyden þus  som seyd it schal be so
Som heelde with him with þe blake berd
Som wiþ þe ballyd som wiþ þikke hered
Som sayd he loked grym as he wold fight
he haþ a sparth of xxti pound of wight
Thus was þe halle ful of deuynyng
Lang after þat þe sonne gan to spryng
The gret Theseus  þat of his sleep is awaked
with menstralcy and noyse þat was maked
held ȝit þe chambre of his paleys riche
Til þat Thebanes knyȝtes boþe Iliche
honoured weren and in to Paleys fet
Duk Theseus was at a wyndow set
Arayed right as he were god in trone
The pepul preseth þider was ful sone
him for to seen  and doon him reuerence
And eek herken his hest and his sentence
An herowd on a skaffold made a hoo
Til al þe noyse of þe pepul was Idoo


And whan he sawh þe pepul of noyse al stille
Thus schewed he þe mighty dukes wille
The lord haþ of his heih discrecioun
Considered þat it were destruccioun
To gentil blood to fighten in þis wise
Of mortal batail now in þis Emprise
were for to schapen þat þey schuld not dye
he wol his firste purpos modifye
No man þerfore vp peyne of los of lyf
No maner schot ne pollax ne schort knyf
In to þe lystes sende or þider bryng
Ne schorte swerd for to stoke þe bytyng
No man ne drawe ne bere by his side 
Ne noman schal to his felawe ryde
But oon cours with a scharpe spere
Feyne if him lust on foote himself to were
And he þat is at meschief schal be take   
And nat slayn but be brought to þe stake
That schal be ordeyned on eyþer syde
But þider he schal by force and þer abyde 
And if so falle a cheuenten be take
On eyþer side or elles sle his make 
No lenger schal þe turneynge laste
God spede ȝou goþ forþ and ley on faste
wiþ long swerd and wiþ mace fiȝt ȝour fille
Goþ now ȝour way þis is þe lordes wille
The voice of þe poepul touchiþ heuen
So lowde cried þei with mylde steuen
God saue such a lord þat is so good
he wilneþ no destruccioun of blood
vp goþ þe trompes and þe melodye
And to þe lystes ryde þe companye 
By ordynaunce þurgh þe cite large
Hangyng wiþ cloþ of gold and not wiþ Sarge
Ful lik a lord þis nobul Duk cam ryde
These tuo Thebans on eyþer side


And after rood þe queen and Emelye
And after hem of ladyes anoþer companye
And after hem of comunes after here degre
And þus þey passeden þurgh þat cite
And to þe lystes come þei by tyme
It nas not of þe day ȝet fully pryme
whan sette was Theseus riche and hye
ypolita þe queen and Emelye
And oþer ladyes in here degrees aboute
vnto þe settes passeþ al þe route
And westward þorugh þe ȝates of mart
Arcite and eek þe hundred of his part
with baners ys Ientred right anoon
And þat selue moment Palomon
Is vnder Venus Estward in þat place
with baner whyt and hardy cheer of face
IN al þe world to seeke vp and doun
So euen wiþoute Variacioun
Ther nere suche companyes tweye  
For ther nas noon so wys þat cowþe seye
That any had of oþer auauntage
Of worthines ne staat ne of visage
So euene were þey chosen for to gesse
And in two Renges faire þey hem dresse
And whan he names Irad were euerychon
That in here nombre gile were þer noon
Tho were þe gates schitt and cried lowde
Dooþ now ȝour deuoir ȝonge knightes proude
The heraldȝ laften here prikyng vp and doun
Now ryngede þe tromp and Clarioun
Ther is no more to say but Est and west
In goþ þe speres in to þe Rest
Ther seen men who can Iuste and who can ryde
In goþ þe scharpe spere in to þe side
Ther schyueren schaftes vpon schuldres þyk
he feeleþ þurgh þe herte spon þe prik


vp sprengen speres on twenty foot on hight
Out goon þe swerdes as þe siluer bright
The helmes þer tohewen and toschrede
Out brast þe blood wiþ stoute stremes reede
with mighty maces þe bones þay tobreste
he þurgh þe þikkest of þe þrong gan þreste
Ther stomblen steedes strong and doun can falle 
he rolled vnder foot as doþ a balle
he feyneþ on his foot wiþ his tronchoun
And him hurteleþ with his hors a doun
He þurgh þe body hurt is and siþþen take
Maugre his heed and brouȝt vnto þe stake 
As forward was right þer he most abyde 
Anoþer lad is on þat oþer syde
And som tyme doþ Theseus hem to rest
hem to refreissche and drinke if hem lest
Ful ofte aday haue þis Thebans twoo
Togider ymet and wrought his felaw woo
vnhorsed haþ ech oþer of hem tweye
Ther nas no Tygyr in þe vale of Galgopleye
whan þat hir whelp is stole whan it is lite  
So cruel on þe hunt as is arcite
For Ielous hert vpon þis Palomon
Ne in Belmary þer is no fel lyoun
That hunted is or for hunger wood
Ne of his prey desireþ so þe blood
As Palomon to sle his foo arcite
This Ielous strokes on here helmes byte
Out renneþ blood on boþe here sides reede
Som tyme an ende þer is on euery dede
For er þe sonne vnto þe reste went
The strang kyng Emetreus gan hent
This Palomon as he faught wiþ arcite
And his swerd in his fleissch he did byte
And by þe force of xxti he is take
Vnȝolden and Idrawe vnto þe stake


And in þe Rescous of þis Palomon
The stronge kyng · ligurgius is born a doun
The kyng Emetreus for al his strengþe
Is born out of his sadel his swerdes lengþe
So hit him palamon er he were take
But al for nought he was brought to þe stake 
his hardy herte might him helpe nouȝt
He most abyde whan þat he was caught
By force and eek by composicioun
who sorweþ now but Palomoun
That moot no more gon agayn to fight
And whan þat Theseus had seen þat sight
he cryed hoo  nomore for it is doon
Ne noon schal lenger vnto his felaw goon
I wol be trewe Iuge and nouȝt partye
Arcyte of Thebes schal haue Emelye
That haþ by his fortune hire Iwonne
Anoon þer is noyse bygonne
For ioye of þis so lowde and heye with alle
It semed þat þe listes wolde falle
what can now fayre Venus doon aboue
what seiþ sche now what doþ þis queen of loue 
But wepeþ so for wantyng of hir wille  
Til þat hire teeres in þe lystes fille
Sche sayde I am aschamed douteles
Satournus seyde douȝter hold þy pees
Mars haþ his wille his knight haþ his boone
And by myn heed þou schalt be esed soone
The trompes wiþ þe lowde mynstralcy
The herawdes þat ful lowde ȝolle and cry
Been in here ioye  for daun arcyte
But herkneþ me and stynteþ but a lite
which a miracle bifel anoon
This arcyte fersly haþ don his helm a doun
And on his courser for to schewe his face
he priked endlange in þe large place


lokyng vpward vpon his Emelye
And sche agayn him cast a frendly yȝe
For wommen as for to speke in comune
Þay folwe alle þe fauour of fortune
And was alle his cheer and in his hert
Out of þe ground a fyr infernal stert
From Pluto send at þe request of Saturne
For which his hors for feere gan to turne
And leep a syde and foundred as he leep
And or þat arcyte may take keep
he pight him on þe pomel of þe heed
That in þat place he lay as he were deed
his brest tobroken with his sadil bowe
As blak he lay as eny col or crowe
So was þe blood yronne in his face
Anon he was yborn out of þe place
with herte sore to Theseus paleys
Tho was he coruen out of his harneys
And in a bed ybrought ful fair and blyue
For ȝit he was in memory and on lyue
And alway cryeng after Emelye
Duk Theseus and al his companye
Is comen hom to Athenes his Cite
with alle blys and gret solempnite
Al be it þat þis auenture was falle  
he nolde nought discomfort hem alle 
Men seyde eek þat arcita schuld nought dye
he schal be helyd of his maladye
And of anoþer þing þey were as fayn
That of hem alle þer was noon yslayn
Al were þey sore hurt and namely oon
That wiþ a spere was þirled his brest boon
To oþer woundes and to broken armes
Some hadde salue and some hadde charmes
Fermacyes of herbes and eek saue
They dronken for þey wolde here lyues haue


For which þis noble duk as he wel can
Comforteþ and honoureþ euery man
And made reuel al þe lange night
vnto the straunge lordes as it was right
Ne þer was holden to discomfytyng
But as a Iustes or as a turmentyng
For soþly þer was no discomfiture
For fallyng is but an aduenture
Ne to be lad wiþ fors vnto þe stake
Vnȝolden and wiþ twenty knightes take
A person allone wiþouten moo
And rent forþ by arme foot and too
And eek his steede dryuen forþ wiþ staues
wiþ foote men boþe ȝemen and knaues
It was aretted him no vylonye
Ne no maner man held it no cowardye
FOr which Theseus lowd anon leet crie
To stynten al rancour and al enuye
The gree as wel on o syde as on oþer
And euery side lik as oþeres broþer
And ȝaf hem ȝiftes after here degre
And fully heeld a feste dayes þre
And conueyed þe knightes worþily
Out of his toun a iournee largely
And hom went euery man þe righte way
Ther was no more but far wel haue good day
Of þis batayl I wol no more endite  
But speke of Palomon and of arcyte
Swelleþ þe brest of Arcyte and þe sore
Encresceþ at his herte more and more
The cloþred blood for eny lechecraft
Corrumpith and in his bouk Ilaft
That noþer veyne blood ne ventusyng
Ne drynk of herbes may ben his helpyng
The vertu expulsik or animal
For þilke vertu cleped natural


Ne may þe venym voyde ne expelle
The pypes of his lounges gan to swelle
And euery lacerte in his brest adoun
Is schent with venym and corrupcioun
Him gayneþ noþer for to get his lyf
Vomyt vpward ne dounward laxatif 
Al is tobroken þilke regioun
Nature haþ now no dominacioun
And certeynly wher nature wil not wirche
Far wel phisik go bere þe man to chirche
This al and som þat arcyte moste dye
For which he sendeþ after Emelye
And Palomon þat was his cosyn deere
Thanne seyd he þus as ȝe schul after heere
Naught may þe woful spirit in myn herte
Declare a poynt of my sorwes smerte
To ȝou my lady þat I loue most
But I byquethe þe seruice of my gost
To ȝou abouen euery creature
Syn þat my lyf may no lenger dure
Allas þe woo allas þe peynes stronge
That I for ȝou haue suffred and so longe
Allas þe deþ allas myn Emelye
Allas departyng of our companye
Allas myn hertes queen allas my wyf
Myn hertes lady ender of my lyf
what is þis world what asken men to haue
Now wiþ his loue now in his colde graue
Allone wiþouten eny companye  
Far wel my swete far wel myn Emelye
And softe take me in ȝour armes tweye
For loue of god and herkneþ what I seye
I haue heer with my cosyn Palomon
had stryf and rancour many a day Igon
For loue of ȝow and eek for Ielousie 
And Iupiter so wis my sowle gye


To speken of a seruaunt proprely
with alle circumstaunces trewely
That is to seyn trouþe honour and knighthede
wysdom humblesse astaat and by kynrede
Fredam and al þat longeþ to þat art
So Iupiter haue of my soule part
As in þis world right now ne know I non
So worthy to be loued as Palomon
That serueth ȝou and wol do al his lyf
And if þat ȝe schul euer be a wyf
Forȝet not Palomon þat gentil man
And with þat word his speche faile gan
For fro his herte vp to his brest was come
The cold of deþ þat him had ouercome
And ȝet more ouer in his armes twoo
Þe vital strengþ is lost and al agoo
Only the intellect wiþouten more
That dwelled in his herte sik and sore
Gan fayle whan þe herte felte deth
Duskyng his eyȝen two and fayled breth
But on his lady ȝit he cast his ye
his laste word was mercy Emelye 
His spiryt chaunged was and wente þer
As I cam neuer I can nat tellen wher
Therefore I stynte I nam no dyuynistre 
Of soules fynde I not in þis registre
Ne me list nat thopynyouns to telle
Of hem þough þat þei wyten wher þey dwelle
Arcyte is cold ther mars his soule gye
Now wol I speke forþ of Emelye 
Shright Emely and howled Palomon  
And Theseus his sustir took anon
Swownyng and bar hir fro þe corps a way
what helpeþ it to tarye forþ þe day
To telle how þat sche weep boþe eue and morwe
For in swich caas wommen can haue such sorwe


whan þat here housbonds ben from hem ago
That for þe more part þey sorwen so
Or elles fallen in such maladye
That atte laste certeynly þey dye
Infynyt been þe sorwes and þe teeres
Of olde folk þat ben of tendre ȝeeres
So gret a wepyng was þer noon certayn
whan Ector was Ibrought al freissh Islayn
As þat þer was for deþ of þis Theban
For sorwe of him þer weepeþ boþe child and man
At troye allas þe pite þat was þere
Cracchyng of cheekes rendyng eek of here
why woldist  þou be deed þis wommen crye
And haddest gold ynowȝand Emelye
No man mighte  glade Theseus 
Sauyng his olde fader Egeus 
That knew þis worldes transmutacioun
As he hadde seen it torne vp and doun
Ioye after woo and woo aftir gladnesse
And schewed him ensample and likenesse
Right as þer deyde neuer man quod he
That he ne lyued in erþe in som degree
Ȝit þer ne lyuede neuer man he seyde
In al þis world þat som tyme he ne deyde
This world nys but a þurghfare ful of woo
And we ben pilgryms passyng to and froo
Deþ is an ende of euery worldly sore
And ouer al þis ȝit seide he mochil more
To þis effect  ful wysly to enhorte
The peple þat schulde him recomforte
Duk Theseus with al his busy cure
Cast busyly wher þat þe sepulture
Of good arcyte may best ymaked be  
And eek most honurable in his degre
And atte last he took conclusioun
That ther as first Arcite and Palomon


hadden for loue þe batail hem bytwene
That in the selue groue soote and greene
Ther as he hadde his amorous desires
His compleynt and for loue his hoote fyres
he wolde make a fyr in which thoffice
Funeral he might al accomplice
And leet comaunde anon to hakke and hewe 
The Okes olde and lay hem on a rewe
In culpouns wel arrayed for to brenne
his officers wiþ swifte foot þey renne
And ryde anon at his comaundement
And after þis Theseus hath Isent
After a beer and it al ouer spradde
wiþ cloþ of golde þe richest þat he hadde
And of þe same sute he clad arcyte
vpon his hondes were his gloues white
Eke on his heed a croune of laurer grene 
And in his hond a swerd ful bright and kene
He leyde him bare þe visage on þe beere
Ther wiþ he weep þat pite was to heere
And for þe poeple schulde see him alle 
whan it was day he brought hem to þe halle
That roreth of þe cry and of þe soun
Tho cam þis woful Theban Palomoun
wiþ flotery berd and ruggy asshy heeres
In cloþis blak ydropped al wiþ teeres
And passyng oþer of wepyng Emelye
The rewfullest of al þe companye
In as moche as þe seruice schulde be
The more nobul and riche in his degre
Duk Theseus leet forth þre steedes bryng
That trapped were in steel al gliteryng
And couered wiþ armes of dan arcyte
Vpon þe steedes that weren grete and white
Ther seeten folk  of which oon bar his scheeld  
Anoþer his spere vp in his hondes heeld


The þridde bar with him his bowe turkeys
Of brend gold was þe caas and eek þe herneys
And riden forth a paas with sorwful chere
Toward þe groue as ȝe schul after heere
The noblest of þe grekes þat þer were
vpon here schuldres carieden þe beere
with slak paas and eyhen reed and wete
Thurghout þe cite by þe maister streete
That sprad was al with blak and wonder hye
Right of þe same is al þe stret Iwrye
vpon þe right hond went olde Egeus
And on þat oþer syde duk Theseus
with vessels in here hand with gold wel fyn
As ful of hony mylk and blood and wyn
Eke Palomon with a gret companye
And after þat com woful Emelye
with fyr in hond as was þat tyme þe gyse 
To do þoffice of funeral seruise
Heyȝ labour and ful gret apparailyng
was at þe seruice and at þe fyr makyng
That with his grene top þe heuen raughte
And twenty fadme of brede tharme straughte 
This is to seyn þe boowes were so brode
Of stree first was þer leyd ful many a loode
but how þe fyr was makyd vpon highte
Ne eek þe names how þe trees highte
As Ook · fyr · birch · asp · aldir · holm · popler ·
wilw elm plane assch box chesteyn lynde laurer
Mapul thorn · beech · hasil · ew · wyppyltre
how þey weren felde schal nouȝt be told for me
Ne how þe goddes ronnen vp and doun
Disheryt of here habitacioun
In which þey whilom woned in rest and pees
Nymphes Faunes and Amadryes
Ne how þe beestes and þe briddes alle
Fledden for feere  whan þe woode was falle 


Ne how þe ground agast was of þe light  
That was nought wont to see no sonne bright
Ne how þe fyr was couchid first wiþ stree
And þanne with drye stykkes clouen in three
And þanne wiþ grene woode and spicerie
And þanne wiþ cloth of gold and wiþ perrye
And gerlandes hangyng with ful many a flour
The myrre thensens wiþ also gret odour
Ne how arcyte lay among al þis
Ne what richesse  aboute his body is
Ne how þat Emely as was þe gyse
Putt in þe fyr of funeral seruise
Ne how she swowned whan sche made þe fyre
Ne what sche spak ne what was hire desire
Ne what iewels men in þe fyr þo cast
whan þat þe fyr was gret and brente fast
And how sum caste hir scheeld and summe her spere
And of here vestimentȝ which þat þey were
And cuppes ful of wyn and mylk and blood
Vnto þe fyr þat brent as it were wood
Ne how þe gregoys wiþ an huge route
Thre tymes ryden al þe fyr aboute
vpon þe lefte hond with an heih schoutyng
And þries wiþ here speres clateryng
And þries how þe ladyes gan to crye
Ne how þat lad was homeward Emelye
Ne how arcyte is brent to aschen colde 
    
Al thilke night ne how þe grekes pleye 
The wake pleyes kepe I nat to seye
who wrastleþ best naked wiþ oyle enoynt
Ne who þat bar him best in no disoynt
I wol not telle eek how þat þey ben goon
Hom til athenes whan þe pley is doon
But schortly to þe poynt now wol I wende
And maken of my longe tale an ende


By proces and by lengþe of certeyn ȝeres
Al styntyd is þe mornyng and þe teeres
Of alle grekys by oon general assent
Than semed me ther was a parlement  
At athenes on a certeyn poynt  and cas
Among þe whiche poyntes spoken was
To han wiþ certeyn contrees alliaunce 
And haue fully of Thebans obeissance
For which þis noble Theseus anon
let senden after gentil Palomon
Vnwist of him what was þe cause and why
But in his blake cloþes sorwfully
he cam at his comaundement in hye
Tho sente Theseus for Emelye
whan þey were sette and hussht was al þe place
And Theseus abyden hadde a space
Or eny word cam fro his wyse brest
His eyen set he þer as was his lest
And wiþ a sad visage he syked stille
And after þat right þus he seide his wille
The firste moeuere of þe cause aboue
whan he first made þe fayre cheyne of loue
Gret was theffect  and heigh was his entente 
wel wist he why and what þerof he mente
For which þat faire cheyne of loue he bond
The fyr þe watir eyr and eek þe lond
In certeyn boundes þat þey may not flee
That same prynce and moeuere eek quod he 
haþ stabled in þis wrecched world a doun
Certeyn dayes and duracioun
To alle þat er engendrid in þis place
Ouer þe day þey may nat pace
Al mowe they ȝit wel here dayes abregge
Ther needeþ non auctorite tallegge
For it is preued by experience
But þat me lust declare my sentence


Than may men wel by þis ordre discerne
That þilke moeuere stabul is and eterne
wel many men knewe but it be a fool
That euery partye dyryueþ from his hool
For nature haþ nat take his bygynnyng
Of no partye ne cantel of a þing  
But of a þing þat parfyt is and stable 
Descendyng so til it be corumpable
And þerfore of his wyse purueaunce 
He hath so wel biset his ordenaunce
That spices of þinges and progressiouns
Schullen endure by successiouns
And nat eterne be wiþoute lye
This maistow vnderstand and se at ye
LO þe Ook þat haþ so long norisschyng
Fro tyme þat it gynneþ first to spring
And as so long a lyf as we may see
Ȝet atte laste wasted is þe tree
COnsidereþ eek how þat þe harde stoon
vnder oure foot  on which we trede and goon
Ȝit wasteth it as it liþ by þe weye
The brode Ryuer som tyme wexeþ dreye
The grete townes see we wane and wende
Than may I see þat al þing haþ an ende
OF man and womman se we wel also 
That wendeþ in oon of þis termes two
That is to seyn  in ȝouþe or elles in age
he moot ben deed  þe kyng as schal a page 
Sum in his bed som in þe deepe see
Som in þe large feel as men may se 
Ther helpeþ naught al goþ þilke weye
Thanne may I see wel þat al þing schal deye
what makeþ þis but Iubiter þe kyng
The which is prynce and cuase of alle thing
Conuertyng al vnto his propre wille
From which he is dereyned soþ to telle 


And here agayn no creature of lyue
Of no degre auayleþ for to stryue
Than is it wisdom as þenkeþ me
To maken vertu of necessite
And take it wel þat we may nat eschewe
And namely þat þat to vs alle is dewe 
And whoso gruccheþ aught he doþ folye
And rebel is to him þat al may gye  
And certeynly a man haþ most honour
To deyen in his excellence and flour
whan he is siker of his goode name
Than haþ he doon his freend ne him no schame
And gladder ought his freend ben of his deþ
whan with honour is ȝolden vp þe breth
Thanne whan his name appeled is for age
For al forgeten is his vasselage
Thanne is it best as for a worþi fame
To dye whan a man is best of name
The contrary of al this is wilfulnesse
why grucchen we why haue we heuynesse 
That good arcyte of chyualry þe flour
Departed is with worschip and honour
Out of þis foule prisoun of þis lyf
why gruccheþ heer his cosyn and his wyf
Of his wel fare þat louen him so wel
Can he hem thank  nay  god woot neuer a del
That boþe his soule and eek hem self offende
And ȝet þey may here lustes nat amende
That may I conclude of þis longe serye
But aftir wo I rede vs to be merye
And þanke Iubiter al of his grace
And or þat we departe fro þis place 
I rede þat we make of sorwes two
O parfyt ioye lastyng euer mo
And lokeþ now wher most sorwe is herInne 
Ther wol we first amenden and bygynne 


Sustyr quod he þis is my ful assent
wiþ al thauys heer of my parlement
That gentil Palomon ȝour owne knight
That serueþ ȝow with herte wil and might
And euer haþ doon syn fyrst tyme ȝe him knewe
That ȝe schul of ȝour grace vpon him rewe
And take him for ȝour housbond and for lord
Lene me ȝoure hand for þis is oure acord
let see now of ȝour wommanly pite
he is a kynges broþir sone pardee  
And þough he were a pore bachiller
Syn he haþ serued ȝou so many a ȝeer
And had for ȝou so gret aduersite
hit moste be considered trusteþ me
For gentil mercy aughte passe right
Than seyde he þus to Palomon ful right
I trowe þer needeþ litel sermonyng
To make ȝou assente to þis þing
Com neer and tak ȝour lady by þe hond
Bitwix hem was Imaad anon þe bond
That highte matrimoyn or mariage
By alle þe counseil and þe baronage
And thus with blys and eek wiþ melodye
Haþ Palomon Iwedded Emelye
And god þat al þis wyde world haþ wrought
Send him his loue þat haþ it deere Ibought
For now is Palomon in al his wele
Lyuynge in blisse richesse and in hele
And Emely him loueth so tendirly
And he hir serueþ also gentilly
That neuer wordes hem bitweene
Of gelousy ne of non oþir teene 
Thus endeþ Palomon and Emelye
And god saue al þis fayre companye  Amen
WHan þat þe knight had þus his tale Itold
In al þe route nas þer ȝong ne old
That he ne seyde it was a noble story
And worþi to be drawen in memory
And namely þe gentils euerich oon
Oure host þo lowh and swoor so moot I goon
This goþ right wel vnbokeled is þe male 
Let se now who schal telle anoþer tale
For trewely þis game is wel bygonne 
Now telleþ now sir monk if þat ȝe konne
Som what to quyte wiþ þe knightes tale 
The Myller þat for drunken was al pale
So þat vnnethe vpon his hors he sat  
he wold auale nowþer hood ne hat
Ne abyde no man for his curtesye
But in Pilates voys he gan to crye
And swor by armes and by blood and bones
I can a noble tale for þe noones
with which I wol now quyte þe knightes tale
Oure hoost saugh wel how dronke he was of ale
And seyde Robyn abyde my leue broþer
Som bettre man schal telle vs first anoþer
Abyd and let vs worken þriftyly
By goddes soule quod he þat wol nat I
For I wol speke or elles go my way
Oure host answed  tel on a deuel way
Thou art a fool þy witt is ouercome 
 Now herkneþ quod þis myller al and some
But first I make a protestacioun
That I am dronke I knowe wel by my soun
And þerfore if þat I mys speke or seye
wyte it þe ale of Southwerk I ȝou preye


For I wol telle a legende and a lyf
Bothe of a Carpenter and of his wyf
how þat þe clerk haþ set þe wriȝtes cappe 
The reue answered and seyde stynt þi clappe 
let be þy lewed drunken harlottrye
It is a synne and eek a greet folye
To apeyren eny man or him defame
And eek to brynge wyues in ylle name
Thou mayst ynowȝ of oþer þinges seyn
This dronken Miller spak ful sone ageyn
And seyde leeue brother Osewold
who hath no wyf he is no Cokewold
But I seye not þerfore þat þou art oon
Ther been ful goode wyues many oon
And euer a þousand goode agayns oon badde
That knowest þou wel þy self but if þou madde
why art þou angry with my tale now 
I haue a wyf par de as wel as thow
Ȝit nolde I for the oxen in my plough  
Take vpon me more þan ynough
Though þat þou deme þiself þat þou be oon
I wol bileeue wel þat I am oon
An housbond schal not be inquisityf
Of goddes pryuete ne of his wyf
So þat he fynde goddes foysoun þere
Of þe remenaunt needeþ nought enquere 
what schuld I seye but þat þis proud Millere
he nolde his wordes for no man forbere
But tolde his cherlisch tale in his manere
Me aþinkeþ þat I schal reherce it heere
And þerfor euery gentil wight I preye
For goddes loue as deme nat þat I seye
Of yuel entent but for I moot reherse
here wordes alle  al be þey better or werse
Or elles falsen som of my mateere
And þerfor whoso list it nat to heere


Turne ouer þe leef and cheese anoþer tale
For he schal fynde ynowe bothe gret and smale
Of storial þing þat toucheþ gentilesse
And eek more ryalte and holynesse
Blameþ nat me If þat ȝe cheese amys
The Miller is a cherl ȝe know wel þis
So was þe reeue and oþir many mo
And harlotry þey tolden boþe two
Auyseþ ȝou and put me out  of blame
And men schulde nat make ernest of game
Whilom þer was dwellyng at Oxenford
A riche gnof that gestes heeld to boorde
And of his craft he was a Carpenter
wiþ him þer was dwellyng a pore scoler
had lerned art but al his fantasye
was torned for to lerne astrologye
An cowde a certeyn of conclusiouns
To deme by interrogaciouns
If þat men axed him in certeyn houres
  whan þat men schuld han drought or ellys schoures
Or if men axed him what schulde bifalle
Of euery þing I may nouȝt reken hem alle
This clerk was cleped heende Nicholas
Of derne loue he cowde and of solas
And þer wiþ he was sleigh and ful priue
And lik amayden meke for to se
A chambir had he in his hostillerye
Alone wiþouten eny compaignye
Ful fetisly Idight with herbes soote 
And he himself as swete as is þe roote
Of lokorys or eny Cetewale
his almagest and bookes gret and smale
his astrylabe longyng for his art
his augrym stoones leyen faire a part
On schelues couched at his beddes heed
his presse Icouered wiþ a faldyng reed
And al aboue þer lay a gay Sawtrye
On which he made a nightes melodye
So swetely þat al þe chambur rang
And angelus ad virginem he sang
And after þat he sang þe kynges note
Ful often blissed was his mery þrote


And þus þis sweete clerk his tyme spente
After his frendes fyndyng and his rente
This carpenter had weddid newe a wyf
which þat he loved more þan his lyf
Of eyȝteteene ȝeer sche was of age
Gelous he was and heeld hir narwe in cage
For sche was wilde and ȝong and he was old
And demed himself be lik a Cokewold
he knew nat Catoun for his wit was rude
That bad man schulde wedde his similitude
Men schulde wedde aftir here astaat
For eelde and ȝouþe ben often at debaat
But syn þat he was brouȝt in to þe snare
He moste endure as oþere doon his care
Fair was þe ȝonge wyf and þer wiþ al
As eny wesil hir body gent and smal  
A seynt sche wered barred al of silk
A barmcloþ eek as whit as morne mylk
vpon hir lendes ful of many a gore
whit was hir smok and browdid albyfore
And eek byhynde on hir coler aboute
Of coleblak silk wiþinne and eek wiþoute
The tapes of hir white voluper
weren of þe same sute of hire coler
hir filet brood of silk yset ful heye
And certeynly sche hadd a licorous eyȝe
Ful smal ypulled weren hir browes two 
And þo were bent as blak as a slo
Sche was wel more blisful on to see
Than is þe newe perionette tree
And softer þan þe wol is of a weþir
And by hir gurdil hyng a purs of leþir
Tassid wiþ silk and perled wiþ latoun
In al þis world to seken vp and doun
Ther nys no man so wys þat couþe þenche 
So gay a popillot or such a wenche 


For brighter was þe smylyng of hir hewe
Than in þe tour þe noble Iforged newe
But of hir song it was as lowde and ȝerne
As eny swalwe chiteryng on a berne
Ther to sche cowde skippe and make game
As eny kyde or calf folowyng his dame
hir mouth was sweete as bragat is or meth
Or hoord of apples layd in hay or heth
wynsyng sche was as is a Ioly colt
long as a mast  and vpright as a bolt 
A broch sche bar vpon hir loue coleer
As brod as is þe bos of a bocleer
hir schos were laced  on hir legges heyȝe
Sche was a primerole a pigges neyȝe
For eny lord haue liggyng in his bedde
Or ȝet for eny good ȝeman to wedde
Now sir and eft sir  so bifel þe cas
That on a day þis heende Nicholas  
Fil wiþ þis ȝonge wyf to rage and pleye
whil þat hir housbond was at Oseneye
As clerkes ben ful sotil and ful queynte
And pryuely he caught hir by þe queynte
And seyde Iwis but if I haue my wille
For derne loue of þe lemman I spille 
And heeld hir harde by þe haunche boones
And seyde lemman loue me al at ones
Or I wol dye as wisly god me saue
And sche sprang out  as doþ a colt in traue
And wiþ hir heed sche wried fast awey
I seyde I wol nat kisse þe by my fey
why let be quod sche  lat be þou nicholas 
Or I wol crye out harrow and allas
Do wey ȝour handes for ȝour curtesye
This nicholas gan mercy for to crye
And spak so faire and profred him so faste
That sche hir loue him graunted atte laste 


And swor hir oth  by seynt thomas of kent
That sche wol be at his comaundement
whan þat sche may hir leysir wel aspye
Myn housbond is so ful of Ielousie 
That but ȝe wayten wel and be pryue
I woot right wel I am but deed quod sche
Ȝe mosten be ful derne as in þis caas
Ther of ne care þe nought quod Nicholas
A clerk haþ litherly byset his while
But if he cowde a carpenter bygyle
And þus þey ben acorded and Isworn
To wayte a tyme as I haue told biforn
Whan Nicholas had doon þus euery del
And thakked hire aboute þe lendys wel
he kist hir sweet  and takeþ his sawtrye
And pleyeþ fast and makeþ melodye
Than fyl it þus  þat to þe parisch chirche 
Cristes owen werkes for to wirche
This goode wyf  went on an haly day
Hir forheed schon as bright as eny day  
So was it waisschen whan sche leet hir werk
NOw þer was of þat chirche a parisch clerk
The which þat was Icleped Absolon
Crulle was his heer and as þe gold it schon
And strowted as a fan right large and brood
Ful streyt and euene lay his ioly schood
his rode was reed his eyȝen gray as goos
with Powles wyndowes coruen in his schoos
In his hoses reed he went fetusly
Iclad he was ful smal and propurly
Al in a kirtel of a fyn wachet
Schapen with goores in þe newe get
And þer vpon he had a gay surplys
As whyt as is þe blosme vpon þe rys
A mery child he was so god me saue
wel couþe he lete blood and clippe and schaue


And make a chartre of lond and acquitaunce
In twenty maners he coude skip and daunce
After þe scole of Oxenforde þo
And wiþ his legges casten to and fro
And pleyen songes on a smal rubible
Therto he sang som tyme a lowde quynyble
And as wel coude he pleye on a giterne 
In al þe toun nas brewhous ne tauerne
That he ne visited with his solas
Ther as any gaylard tapster was
Bot soþ to say he was som del squaymous
Of fartyng  and of speche daungerous
This absolon þat ioly was and gay
Goþ wiþ a senser on þe haly day
Sensyng þe wyues of þe parisch fast
And many a louely look on hem he cast
And namely on þis Carpenteres wyf
To loke on hire him þought a mery lyf
Sche was so propre sweete and licorous
I dar wel sayn if sche had ben a mous
And he a cat he wold hir hent anoon
This parisch clerk this Ioly Absolon  
Haþ in his herte such a loue longyng
That of no wyf ne took he noon offryng 
For curtesy he seyde he wolde noon
The moone at night ful cleer and brighte schoon
And absolon his giterne haþ Itake
For paramours he seyde he wold awake 
And for he goþ iolyf and amerous 
Til he cam to þe Carpenteres hous
A litel after þe cok had ycrowe 
And dressed him vp by a schot wyndowe 
That was vnder þe Carpenteres wal
he syngeþ in his voys gentil and smal
Now deere lady if þi wille be
I praye ȝow þat ȝe wol rewe on me


Ful wel acordyng to his gyternyng
This carpenter awook and herde him syng
And spak vnto his wyf and sayde anoon
what alisoun herestow not absolon
That chaunteþ þus vnder oure boure smal
And sche answerd hir housbond þer wiþ al
Ȝis God woot Iohn I heere it euery del
This passeþ forth what wil ȝe bet þan wel
Fro day to day þis Ioly Absolon
So woweþ hire þat him is wo bigon
he wakeþ al þe night and al þe day
To kembe his lokkes brode and made him gay
he wowith hire by mene and by brocage
And swor he wolde ben hir owne page 
he syngeþ crowyng as a nightyngale
And sent hire pyment meth and spiced ale 
And wafres pypyng hoot out of þe gleede
For þat sche was of toune he profred meede
For som folk wol be wonne for richesse
And som for strokes som for gentillesse
Som tyme to schewe his lightnes and maistrye
he pleyeth herodȝ on a scaffold hye
But what avayleþ him as in þis caas 
Sche loueþ so þis heende Nicholas  
That absolon may blowe þe bukkes horn
he ne had for al his labour but a skorn
And þus sche makeþ absolon hir ape
And al his ernest torneþ to a Iape
Ful soþ is þis prouerbe it is no lye
Men seyn right þus alway þe ney slye
Makeþ þe ferre leef to be loþ
For þough þat absolon be wood or wroth
By cause þat he fer was from here sight
This Nicholas haþ stonden in his light
Now bere þe wel þou heende Nicholas
For absolon may wayle and synge allas


 And so bifell it on a Satyrday
This Carpenter was gon to Osenay
And heende Nicholas and alisoun
Acordid ben to þis conclusioun
That Nicholas schal schapen hem a wyle
This sely Ielous housbond to begyle 
And if so were þis game wente aright
Sche schulde slepe in his arm al night
For þis was hire desir and his also
And right anoon wiþouten wordes mo
This Nicholas no lenger wold he tarye
But doþ ful softe in to his Chambur carye
Boþe mete and drynke for a day or tweye
And to hir housbond bad hir for to seye
If þat he axed after Nicholas
Sche schulde seye sche wiste nat wher he was
Of al þat day sche saw him nat with eye
Sche trowed he were falle in som maladye
For no cry þat hir mayden cowde him calle
he nolde answere for nought þat may bifalle
This passeþ forþ al þat ilke satyrday
Tha Nicholas in his chambre lay
And eet and drank and dede what him leste
Til soneday þe sonne was gon to reste
This sely carpenter haþ gret meruaile  
Of Nicholas or what þing may him ayle
And seyde I am adrad by seynt Thomas
It stondeþ nat aright wiþ Nicholas
God schilde þat he deyde sodeinly
This world is now ful tykel sikerly
I saugh today a corps yborn to chirche
That now on monday last I saugh him wirche
Go vp quod he vnto his knaue anoon
Clepe at his dore and knokke wiþ a stoon
Loke how it is and telle me boldely
This knaue goþ him vp ful sturdily


And at þe chambir dore whil he stood
he cryed and knokked as þat he were wood
what how what do ȝe mayster nicholay
how may ȝe slepen al þis longe day
But al for nought he herde nat o word
An hole he fond right lowe vpon a boord
Ther as þe cat was wont in for to creepe 
And at þat hole he loked in ful deepe 
And atte laste he hadde of him a sight
This nicholas sat euer gapyng vpright
As he had loked on þe newe moone
Adoun he goþ and tolde his mayster soone
In what aray he sawh þis ilke man
This carpenter to blessen him bygan
And seyde now help vs seynte Frideswyde
A man woot litel what him schal betyde
This man is falle with his astronomye
In som woodnesse or in som agonye
I thought ay wel how þat it schulde be
Men schulde nought knowe of goddes pryuyte
 Ȝe blessed be alwey a lewed man
That nat but oonly his bileeue can
So ferde anoþer clerk with astronomye 
he walked in the feeldes for to prye
vpon þe sterres what þer schulde bifalle
Til he was in a marle pit Ifalle 
he saugh nat þat but ȝet by seint Thomas 
Me reweth sore for heende nicholas  
he schal be ratyd of his studyyng
If þat I may by ihū heuen kyng
Gete me a staf þat I may vnder spore
whil þat þou Robyn heuest vp þe dore
he schal out of his studyyng as I gesse
And to þe chambir dore he gan him dresse 
his knaue was a strong karl for þe noones
And by þe hasp he haf it vp at oones


And in þe floor þe dore fil doun anoon
This nicholas sat stille as eny stoon
And euer he capyd vpward to þe eyr
This Carpenter wende he were in despeir
And hent him by þe schuldres mightily
And schook him harde and cryed spitously
what Nicholas what how man loke a doun
Awake and þynk on cristes passioun
I crowche þe from Elues and from wightes
Therwith þe nightspel seyde he anon rightes
On þe foure halues of þe hous aboute 
And of þe þreisshfold of þe dore wiþoute
lord Ihū crist and seynte bendight
Blesse þis hous from euery wikkede wight
for nyghtes verray þe white paternoster
wher wonestow now seynte petres soster
And atte laste heende Nicholas
Gan for to syke sore and seyde allas
Schal al þe world be lost eft sones now
This Carpenter answerde what seystow 
what þenk on god as we doon men þat swynke
This Nicholas answerde fette me drynke
And after wol I speke in pryuyte
Of certeyn þing þat toucheþ þe and me
I wol telle it non oþer man certayn
This Carpenter goþ forth and comþ agayn
And brought of mighty ale a large quart
whan ech of hem ydronken had his part
This Nicholas his dore gan to schitte
And dede þis carpenter doun by him sitte  
And seide Iohan myn host ful leue and deere
Thou schalt vpon þy trouþe swere me heere 
That to no wight þou schalt þis counsel wreye
For it is cristes counsel þat I seye
And if þou telle it man þou art forlore
For þis vengaunce þou schalt han þerfore


That if þou wreye me þou schalt be wood
Nay crist forbede it for his holy blood
Quod þo þis sely man I am no labbe
Though I it say I am nought leef to gabbe 
Say what þou wolt I schal it neuer telle 
To child ne wyf by him þat harwed helle
Now Iohan quod nicholas I wol not lye
I haue Ifounde in myn astrologye
As I haue loked in þe moone bright
That now on monday next at quarter night
Schal falle a reyn and þat so wilde and wood
That half so gret was neuer Noes flood
This worlde he seyde more þan an hour
Schal ben Idreynt so hidous is þe schour
Thus schal mankynde drenche and leese his lyf
This Carpenter answered allas my wyf
And shal she drenche allas myn alisoun
For sorwe of þis he fel almost adoun
And seyde is þer no remedy in þis caas
whe ȝis for gode quod heende Nicholas
If þou wolt werken aftir lore and reed
Thou maist nought worke after þin owen heed
For þus seiþ Salomon þat was ful trewe
werke by counseil  and þou schalt nat rewe
And if þou worken wolt by good counsail
I vndertake wiþouten mast and sail
Ȝet schal I sauen hir and þe and me
hastow nat herd  how saued was Noe
whan þat our lord had warned him biforn
That al þe world wiþ watir schulde be lorn
Ȝis quod þis Carpenter ful ȝore ago
hastow nought herd quod Nicholas also  
The sorwe of Noe wiþ his felaschipe
That he hadde or he gat his wyf to schipe
him hadde wel leuer I dar wel vndertake 
At þilke tyme þan alle his weþeres blake


That sche hadde a schip hir self allone
And þerfore wostow what is best to doone 
This axeþ hast and of an hasty þing
Men may nought preche or make taryyng
Anon go gete vs fast in to þis In
A knedyng trowh or elles a kemelyn
For ech of vs but loke þat þey be large
In which þat we may rowe as in a barge
And haue þer In vitaille suffisant
But for o day fy on þe remenant
The water schal aslake and gon away
Aboute prime vppon þe nexte day
But Robyn may not wite of þis þy knaue
Ne ek þy mayde Gille I may not saue
Aske nought why for þough þou aske me
I wol nat tellen goddes pryuete
Sufficeth þe but if þat þy witt madde
To haue as gret a grace as noe hadde 
Thy wyf schal I wel sauen out of doute 
Go now þy wey and speed þe heer aboute
And whan þou hast for hir and þe and me 
Igoten vs þis knedyng tubbes þre
Than schalt þou hange hem in þe roof ful hie
That no man of oure purueaunce aspye
And whan þou þus hast doon as I haue seyd
And hast our vitaille faire in hem Ileyd
And eek an ax to smyte þe corde atwo
whan þat þe water comeþ þat we may goo
And breke an hole an hye vpon þe gable
In to þe gardynward ouer þe stable 
That we may frely passen forþ oure way
whan þat þe grete schour is gon away
Than schaltow swymme as mery I vndertake
As doth þe white doke aftir hir drake  
Than wol I clepe how alisoun how Ion


And þou wolt seye heyl maister nicholay
Good morn I see þe wel for it is day
And þan schul we be lordes al oure lyf
Of al þe world as noe and his wyf
But of oo þing I warne þe ful right
Be wel auysed of þat ilke nyght
That we ben entred in to schippes boord
That not of vs ne speke not a word
Ne clepe ne crye but be in his preyere
For it is goddes owne heste deere
Thy wyf and þou most hangen fer atwynne
For þat bitwixe ȝou schal be no synne
No more in lokyng þan þer schal in dede 
This ordynaunce is seyd so god me speede 
To morwe at night whan men ben a slepe 
In to our knedyng tubbes wol we crepe 
And sitte þer abydyng goddes grace 
Go now þy way I haue no lenger space
To make of þis no lenger sermonyng
Men seyn þus  send þe wyse and sey no þing
Thou art so wys it needeth nat þe teche
Go saue oure lyf and þat I þe byseche 
This seely carpenter goþ forþ his way
Ful ofte he seyd allas and weylaway
And to his wyf he told his pryuete
And sche was war and knew it bet þan he 
what al this wente cast was for to seye 
But naþeles sche ferd as sche schuld deye
And seyde allas go forth þy way anoon

I am þy verray trewe wedded wyf
Go deere spouse and help to saue oure lyf
lo which a gret þing is affeccioun
A man may dye for ymaginacoun
So deepe may impressioun be take
This seely Carpenter bygynneth quake  

him þenkeþ verrayly þat he may se
Noes flood come walkyng as þe see 
To drenchen alisoun his hony deere
he weepeþ wayleþ he maketh sory cheere

And goth and geteth him a knedyng trough
And after þat a tubbe and a kymelyn
And pryuely he sent hem to his In
And heng hem in þe roof in pryuete
His owne hond þan made laddres þre
To clymben by þe ronges and þe stalkes
vnto þe tubbes hangyng in þe balkes
And hem vitayled boþe trough and tubbe
with breed and cheese wiþ good ale in a Iubbe
Suffisyng right ynough as for a day
But or þat he had maad al þis array
he sent his knaue and eek his wenche also
vpon his neede to londoun for to go
And on þe monday whan it drew to nyght
he schette his dore wiþouten candel light
And dressed al þis þing as it schuld be
And schortly vp þey clumben alle þre
They seten stille wel a forlong way
Now pater noster clum quod Nicholay
And Clum quod Ion and Clum  quod Alisoun
This Carpenter seyd his deuocioun
And stille he sitt and byddeþ his prayere
Ay waytyng on þe Reyn if he it heere
The deede sleep for verray busynesse
Fil on þis Carpenter right as I gesse 
Abowten courfew tyme or litel more
For trauail of his goost he groneþ sore
And eft he routeþ for his heed myslay
Doun of þe laddir stalkeþ Nicholay
And alisoun ful softe a doun hir spedde
wiþouten wordes mo þey goon to bedde


Ther as þe Carpenter was wont to lye
Ther was þe Reuel and þe melodye  
And þus lith alisoun and Nicholas
In busynesse of myrþe and of solas
Til þat þe belles of laudes gan to rynge
And freres in þe Chauncel gan to synge
This parissch clerk þis amerous absolon
That is for loue so harde and woo bygon
vpon þe Monday was at Osenay
with company him to desporte and play
And axed vpon caas a cloysterer
Ful pryuely after þe carpenter
And he drough him a part out of þe chirche
And sayde nay I say him nat here wirche
Syn satirday I trow þat he be went
For tymber þer our abbot hath him sent
For he is wont for tymber for to goo
And dwellen at þe graunge a day or tuo
Or elles he is at his hous certayn
wher þat he be I can nat soþly sayn
This absolon ful ioly was and light
And thoughte now is tyme wake al night
For sikerly I sawh him nought styryng
Aboute his dore syn day bigan to spryng
So mote I þryue I schal at Cokkes crowe
Ful pryuely go knokke at his wyndowe
That stant ful lowe vpon his bowres wal
To alisoun þan wol I tellen al
My louelongyng for ȝet I schal not mysse
That atte leste wey I schal hir kisse
Som maner comfort schal I haue par fay
My mouth haþ icched al þis longe day
That is a signe of kissyng atte leste
Al nyght I mette eek I was at a feste
Ther fore I wol go slepe an hour or tweye
And al þe night þan wol I wake and pleye


whan þat þe firste cok haþ crowe anoon

And him arrayeþ gay at poynt deuys
But first he cheweþ greyn and lycoris  
To smellen swete or he hadde kempt his heere
vnder his tunge a trewe loue he beere 
For þer by wende he to be gracious
he romeþ to þe carpenteres hous
And stille he stant vnd þe schot wyndowe 
vnto his brest it raught it was so lowe 
And softe he cowhiþ with a semy soun

My fayre bryd my swete Cynamome
Awake lemman myn and spekeþ tome

That for ȝoure loue I swelte þer I go
No wonder is if þat I swelte and swete

Iwis lemman I haue such louelongyng
That like a turtil trewe is my moornyng
I may not ete no more þan a mayde 
 Go fro þe wyndow Iakke fool sche sayde 
As help me god it wol not be com paine

Go forþ þy wey or I wol cast a stoon
And let me slepe a twenty deuelway

For Iesus loue and for þe loue of me

Than mak þe redy quod sche I come anon
    
    
This absolon doun sette him on his knees


And seide I am a lord at alle degrees
For after þis I hope þer comeþ more
Lemman þy grace  and swete bryd þyn ore
The wyndow sche vndyd and þat in hast

lest þat our neygheboures þe aspye
This absolon gan wipe his mouþ ful drye  
Derk was þe night as picche or as a cole 
Out atte wyndow putte sche hir hole 
And absolon him fel no bet ne wers
But wiþ his mouth he kist hir naked ers
Ful sauorly whan he was war of þis
Abak he sterte and þought it was amys
For wel he wist a womman haþ no berd
he felt a þing al rough and long Iherd
And seyde fy allas what haue I do
Tehee quod sche  and clapt þe wyndow to
And absolon goþ forþ a sory paas
A berd a berd  quod heende Nicholas
By goddes corps þis game goþ fair and wel
This seely absolon herd euery del
And on his lippe he gan for angir byte
And to himself he seyde I schal þe quyte
Who rubbiþ now who froteth now his lippes

But absolon þat seith fulofte allas
My soule bytake I vnto Sathanas
But me were leuer þan alle þis toun quod he
Of þis dispit awroken for to be
Allas quod he allas I nadde bleynt
his hoote loue was cold and al Iqueynt
For fro þat tyme þat he had kist hire ers
Of paramours ne sette he nat a kers
For he was helyd of his maledye
Fulofte paramours he gan deffye
And wept as doþ a child þat is Ibete
A softe paas went he ouer þe strete 


Vnto a smyth men clepith daun Gerueys
That in his forge smythed plowh harneys
He scharpeth schar and cultre bysily
This absolon knokkeþ al esily
And seyde vnto Geruays and þat anoon

what eyleþ ȝou some gay gurl god it woot

By seinte noet  ȝe wot wel what I mene
This absolon ne roughte nat a bene
Of al þis pley no word agayn he ȝaf
For he hadde more tow on his distaf
Than Gerueys knew and seyde freend so deere
That hote cultre in þe Chymney heere
As lene it me I haue þer wiþ to doone
I wol it bring agayn to þe ful soone
Gerueys answerde  certes were it gold
Or in a poke nobles al vntold
Ȝe schul him haue as I am trewe smyth
Ey cristes fo what wil ȝe do þer wiþ
Ther of quod absolon be as be may
I schal wel telle it þe to morwe day
And caughte þe cultre by þe colde stele
Ful soft out at þe dore he gan it stele 
And wente vnto þe carpenteres wal
he cowheþ first and knokkeþ þer wiþ al
vpon the wyndow right as he dede er
This alisoun answerde who is ther
That knokkest so I warant it a þeef
why nay quod he god woot my sweete leef
I am þyn absolon O my derlyng
Of gold quod he I haue þe brought a ryng
My mooder ȝaf it me so god me saue
Ful fyn it is and þerto wel Igraue


This wol I ȝiue þe  if þou me kisse
This Nicholas was rise for to pysse
And þought he wold amenden al þe Iape
he schulde kisse his ers or þat he skape
And vp þe wyndow dyde he hastily
And out his ers putteþ he pryuely
Ouer þe buttok to haunche bon
And þer wiþ spak þis clerk þis absolon
Spek sweete bryd I wot nat wher þou art 
This Nicholas anon let flee a fart  
As gret as it had ben a thundir dent
And with þat strook he was almost Iblent
And he was redy with his yren hoot
And Nicholas amyd þe ers he smoot
Of goþ þe skyn an hande brede aboute
The hoote cultre brente so his toute
And for þe smert  he wende for to dye
As he were wood anon he gan to crye
help watir watir  help for goddes herte
This Carpenter out of his slumber sterte
And herd on crye watir as he were wood
He þought allas for now comeþ Noes flood
he sit him vp wiþoute wordes mo
And wiþ his ax he smot þe corde atwo
And doun he goþ he fond nowthir to selle 
No bred ne ale til he com to þe selle
Vpon þe floor and þer aswoun he lay
vp styrt hir alisoun and Nicholay
And cryden out and harrow in þe strete 
The neyghebours boþe smal and grete 
In ronnen for to gauren on þis man
That a swowne lay boþe pale and wan
For with þe fal he brosten had his arm
But stond he muste to his owne harm
For whan he spak he was anon born doun
with heende Nicholas and alisoun


They tolden euery man þat he was wood
he was a gast and feerd of Noes flood
Thurgh fantasie þat of his vanite 
he hadde Ibought him knedyng tubbes þre 
And hadde hem hanged in þe roof aboue 
And þat he preyed hem for goddes loue 
To sitten in þe roof par compaignye
The folk gan lawhen at his fantasye 
In to þe roof þey kyken and þey gape
And torne al his harm in to a Iape
For what so euer þe carpenter answerde
Hit was for nought no man his resoun herde  
wiþ oþis greet he was so sworn a doun
That he was holden wood in al þe toun
For euery clerk anon right heeld wiþ oþir
They seyde þe man was wood my leeue broþer
And euery man gan lawhen at his stryf
Thus swyued was þe Carpenteres wyf
For al his kepyng and his gelousye
And absolon haþ kist hir neþir ye
And Nicholas is skaldid in his towte
This tale is doon and god saue al þe route
Whan folk hadde lawhen of þis nyce caas
Of Absolon and heende Nicholas
Dyuerse folk dyuersely þey seyde
But for þe moste part þey lowh and pleyde 
Ne at þis tale I sawh no man him greue
But it were oonly Osewald þe Reeue
By cause he was of Carpentrye craft
A litel Ire is in his herte is laft
He gan to grucche and blamed it a lite
So theek quod he ful wel coude I þe quyte
with bleryng of a prowd mylleres ye
If þat me luste speke of Ribaudye
But yk am old me list not pley for age
Gras tyme is doon my foddir is now forage
My whyte top writeþ myn olde ȝeeres 
Myn hert is al so moulyd as myn heeres 
And ȝit I fare as doþ an openers
That ilke fruyt is euer lenger þe wers
Til it be rote in mullok or in stree
we olde men I drede so fare we 
Til we be roten can we nat be rype
we hoppen alway whil þe world wol pype
For in oure wil þer stikeþ euer a nayl
To haue an hoor heed and a greene tayl
As hath a leek for þough oure might be doon
Oure wil desireþ folye euer in oon
For whan we may nat do þan wol we speke   
Ȝet in oure aisshen old is fyr Ireke 
Foure gledys haue we which I schal deuyse
Auantyng  lyyng  angur coueytise
This foure sparkys longen vnto eelde 
Oure olde lymes mowen be vnweelde 


But wil ne schal nat fayle vs þat is soþ
And ȝet I haue alwey a coltes toþ
As many a ȝeer as it is passed henne
Syn þat my tappe of lyf bygan to renne 
For sikirlik whan I was born anon
Deth drough þe tappe of lyf and leet it goon
And now so longe  haþ þe tappe Ironne
Til þat almost al empty is þe tonne
The streem of lyf now droppeth on þe chymbe
The sely tonge may wel rynge and chimbe
Of wrecchednes þat passed is ful ȝoore
with olde folk  sauf dotage is no more
Whan þat oure host had herd oure sermonyng
he gan to speke as lordly as a kyng
And seyde what amounteþ al þis wit
what schul we speke alday of holy wryt
The deuyl made a Reue for to preche
Or of a sowter schipman or a leche 
Sey forþ þi tale and tarye nat þe tyme
Lo heer is Depford  and it is passed prime
Lo Grenewich þer many a schrewe is Inne
It were al tyme þi tale to bygynne
NOw sires quod þis Osewold þe Reue
I pray ȝow alle  þat noon of ȝou him greeue
Though I answere and somwhat sette his howue
For leeful is wiþ force force to showue
This dronken myllere haþ Itold vs heer
how þat bygiled was a Carpenter
Parauenture in scorn for I am oon
And by ȝour leue I schal him quyte anoon
Right in his cherles termes wol I speke 
I pray to God his nekke mot tobreke
he can wel in myn eye see a stalke  
But in his owne he can nought seen a balke
AT Trompyngtoun nat fer fro Cantebrigge
Ther goth a brook and ouer þat a brigge
Vpon þe whiche brook þer stant a melle
And þis is verray soþ þat I ȝou telle 
A meller was þer dwellyng many a day
As eny Pecok he was prowd and gay
Pipen he coude and fissh and nettys beete
And turne cuppes wrastle wel and scheete
Ay by his belt he bar a long panade
And of a swerd ful trenchaunt was þe blade
A Ioly popper bar he in his pouche
Ther was no man for perel durst him touche 
A Scheffeld thwitel bar he in his hose
Round was his face and camois was his nose
As pyled as an ape was his skulle
he was a market beter at þe fulle
Ther durste no wight hand vpon him legge
That he ne swor anon he schuld abegge 
A þeef he was forsoþ of corn and mele
And þat a sleigh and vsyng for to stele 
his name was hoote deynous Symekyn
A wyf he hadde  come of noble kyn
The parsoun of the toun hir fader was
with hire he ȝaf ful many a panne of bras
For þat Symkyn schuld in his blood allye
Sche was Ifostryd in a Nonnerye
For Symkyn wolde no wyf as he sayde
But sche were wel Inorissched and a mayde 
To sauen his estaat and ȝomanrye
And sche was proud and pert as is a pye
A ful fair sighte was þer on hem two 
On haly dayes bifore hir wolde he go


with his typet ybounde aboute his heed
And sche cam aftir in a gyte of reed
And Symkyn hadde hosen of þe same   
Ther durste no wight clepe hir but ma dame 
was noon so hardy walkyng by þe weye
That with hir dorste rage or elles pleye
But if he wold be slayn of Symekyn·
wiþ panade or with knyf or boydekyn·
For gelous folk ben perilous eueremo
Algate þey wolde here wyues wende so
And eek for sche was somdel smoterlich
Sche was as deyne as water in a dich
As ful of hokir and of bissemare
hir thoughte ladyes oughten hir to spare 
what for hir kynreed and hir nortelrye
That sche had lerned in þe Nonnerye
A douȝter hadden þey betwix hem two
Of xxti ȝeer wiþouten eny mo
Sauyng a child that was of half ȝer age
In cradil lay and was a proper page 
This wenche þikke and wel Igrowen was
wiþ Camoys nose and eyȝen gray as glas 
And buttokkes brode and brestes round and hye
But right fair was hir heer I wol nat lye 
The parsoun of þe toun for sche was feir
In purpos was to maken hir his heir 
Boþe of his catel  and his mesuage 
And straunge made it of hir mariage
his purpos was to bystow hir hye
In to som worþy blood of ancetrye
For holy chirche good moot be despendid
On holy chirche blood þat is descendid
Therfore he wolde his Ioly blood honoure 
Though þat he schulde holy chirche deuoure
GRet soken had þis meller oute of doute
with whete and malt of al þe lond aboute


And namely þer was a gret Collegge
Men clepe it þe Soler hall of Cantebregge
Ther was here whete and eek here malt Igrounde 
And on a day it happed on a stounde 
Syk lay þe mauncyple on a maledye  
Men wenden wisly þat he schulde dye
For which þis meller stal both mele and corn
A þousend part more þan byforn
For þer biforn he stal but curteysly
But now he is a þeef outrageously
For which þe wardeyn chidde and made fare
But ther of sette þe meller not a tare
he crakked boost and swor it was nat so
Thanne weren þere poore scoleres tuo
That dwelten in þe halle of which I seye
Testyf þey were and lusty for to pleye
And oonly for here mirþe and reuelrye
Vppon þe wardeyn bysily þey crye
To ȝeue hem leue but a litel stounde 
To go to melle and see here corn Igrounde
And hardily þey dursten ley here nekke 
The meller schuld nat stel hem half a pekke
Of corn by sleighte ne by force hem reue
And atte last þe wardeyn ȝaf hem leue
Iohn hight þat oon and Alayn hight þat oþer
Of o toun were þey born þat highte Strothir 
Fer in þe north I can nat telle where 
This aleyn makeþ redy al his gere
And on an hors þe sak he cast anoon
Forþ goþ aleyn þe clerk and also Ion
wiþ good swerd and wiþ bocler by her side
Iohn knew þe way þat hem needith no gyde 
And at þe mylle þe sak adoun he layth
Alayn spak first al heil Symond in faith
how fares þy faire doughter and þy wyf
aleyn welcome quod Symond by my lyf


And Iohn also how now what do ȝe heere
By god quod Iohn Symond neede has na peere
him falles serue himself þat has na swayn
Or elles he is a fon as clerkes sayn
Our mancyple as I hope wil be deed
Swa werkes ay þe wanges in his heed
And therfore I is come and eek aleyn  
To grynde oure corn and carie it  ham ageyn
I prey ȝou speed vs in al þat ȝe may
It schal be doon quod Symkyn by my fay
what wol ȝe do whil þat it is in hande
By god right by þe hoper wol I stande
Quod Iohn and se how þat þe corn gas Inne
Ȝet sawh I neuer by my fader kynne 
how þat þe hoper waggis to and fra
Aleyn answerde  Iohn and wiltow swa
Than wol I be byneþe by my croun
And se how þat þe mele fallys doun
In to þe trough þat schal be my desport 
For Ion in faith I may be of ȝour sort
I is as ille a meller as ere ȝe
This mellere smyleth for here nycete
And þought al þis is doon but for a wyle
They wenen þat no man may hem bigile
But by my þrift ȝet schal I blere here ye
For al here sleight and al here philosophie 
The more queynte knakkes þat þey make 
The more wol I stele whan I take 
In stede of mele ȝet wol I ȝeue hem bren
The grettest clerkes beþ not wisest men
As whilom to þe wolf þus spak þe mare
Of al hert art ne counte I nat a tare
Out at þe dore he goth ful pryuyly
whan þat he saugh his tyme sotyly
he lokeþ vp and doun til he hath founde
The Clerkes hors þer as it stood Ibounde 


Behynde þe mylle vnder a leuesel
And to þe hors he goþ him faire and wel
He strepeth of þe bridel right anoon
And whan þe hors was loos he gan to goon
Toward þe fen þere wilde mares renne
For wiþ wihe  þurgh þikke and eek þurgh þenne
This meller goth agayn and no word seyde
But doth his note and wiþ þe clerkes pleyde 
Til þat her corn was fair and wel Igrounde  
And whan þe mele was sakked and Ibounde 
This Iohn goþ out and fynt his hors away
And gan to crye harrow and weylaway
Oure hors is lost aleyn for goddes banes
Step on þy feet cum on man al at anes
Aleyn ȝour wardeyn haþ his parfray lorn
This aleyn al forgeteþ mele and corn
Al was out of his mynd his housbondrye
what wikked way is he gan gan he crye
The wyf cam lepyng inward wiþ a ren
Sche seyde allas ȝour hors goþ to þe fen
wiþ wylde mares as fast as he may go 
vnþank come on his heed þat band him so 
And he þat bettir schuld han knyt þe Reyne
Allas quod Iohan aleyn  for cristes peyne
Leg doun þi swerd and I sal myn alswa 
I is ful wight god wat as is a Ra
By goddes hart he sal nat scape vs bathe
why nad þou put þe capil in þe lathe
Ilhail aleyn by god þou is a fon
This sely clerkes speeden hem anoon
Toward þe fen boþe aleyn and eek Ion
And whan þe myller sawh þat þey were gon
he half a busshel of þe flour haþ take
And bad his wyf go knede it in a cake
he seyde I trowe þe clerkes ben a ferd
Ȝet can a Miller make a clerkes berd


For al his art ȝe lat hem go here way
lo wher þey goon  ȝe lat þe children play
They get hym nat so lightly by my croun
This seely clerkes ronnen vp and doun
wiþ keep  keep stand stand Iossa ware derere
Ga wightly þou and I sal keep him heere 
But schortly til þat it was verray night 
They cowde nat þough þey did al here might
here capil cacche it ran away so fast 
Til in a diche þey caught  him atte last
wery and wete as bestys in þe Reyn  
Comth sely Iohn and wiþ him comþ aleyn
Allas quod Iohn þat day þat I was born
Now are we dryue til heþing and to scorn
Oure corn is stole men woln vs foles calle 
Bathe þe wardeyn and eek our felaws alle 
And namely þe myller weyloway
Thus pleyneth Iohn as he goþ by þe way
Toward þe mylle and bayard in his hand
The myller sittyng by þe fyr he fand
For it was night and forþer might þey nought
But for þe loue of god þey him bisought
As herberwh and of ese as for her peny
Þe myller sayd agayn if þer be eny
Swich as it is ȝit schul ȝe haue ȝour part
Myn hous is streyt  but ȝe han lerned art
Ȝe conne by argumentes make a place
A myle brood of twenty foote of space 
let se now if þis place may suffyse
Or make it rom wiþ speche as is ȝour gyse
Now Symond seyde þis Iohn by seynt Cuthberd
Ay is þou mery and þat is fair answerd
I haue herd say men suld take of twa þinges
Slik as he fynt  or tak slik as he bringes
But specially I pray þe host ful deere
Get vs som mete and drynk and mak vs cheere


And we wol paye trewly at þe fulle
wiþ empty hand men may na hawkes tulle
Lo heer our siluer redy for to spende
This meller in to toun his doughter sende
For ale and breed and rosted hem a goos
And band her hors he schold no more go loos
And in his owne chambir hem made a bed
with schetys and with chalouns fair Ispred
Nat from his owen bed ten foot or twelue 
his doughter had a bed al by hir selue
Right in þe same chambre by and by
Hit mighte be no bet and cause why 
Ther was no rommer herberw in þe place  
They sowpen and þey speke hem to solace
And dronken euer strong ale atte beste
Aboute mydnyght wente þey to reste
wel haþ þe myller vernysshed his heed
Ful pale he was for dronken and nat reed
he ȝoxeth and he spekeþ þurgh þe nose 
As he were on þe quakke or on þe pose 
To bed he goþ and wiþ him goþ his wyf
As eny Iay sche light was and iolyf
So was his ioly whistel wel ywet
The cradil at hire beddes feet is set
To rokken and to ȝiue þe child to souke 
And whan þat dronken was al in þe crouke
To bedde went the douȝter right anon
To bedde goþ aleyn and also Ion
Ther nas no more him needed no dwale
This meller haþ so wysly bibbed ale 
That as an hors he snortith in his sleep
Ne of his tayl bihynd took  he no keep
his wyf burdoun a ful strong
Men might her rowtyng heeren a forlong
The wenche routeþ eek par companye
Aleyn þe clerk þat herd þis melodye


He pokyd Iohn  and seyde slepistow
Herdistow euer slik a sang er now
Lo slik a couplyng is betwix hem alle
A wilde fyr vpon þair bodyes falle
wha herkned euer swilk a ferly þing 
Ȝe þei sul haue þe flour of ille endyng
This lange night þer tydes me na rest
But ȝet na fors al sal be for þe best
For Iohn sayd he as euer mot I þryue
If þat I may ȝone wenche sal I swyue
Som esement haþ lawe schapen vs
For Iohn þer is a lawe þat says þus
That if a man in a poynt be agreued
That in anoþer he sal be releeued
Oure corn is stoln soþly it is na nay  
And we haue had an ylle fitt to day
And syn I sal haue nan amendement
Agayn my los I wol haue esement 
By godde sale it sal nan oþer be 
This Iohn answerd  aleyn auyse þe
The Miller is a parlous man he sayde
And if þat he out of his sleep abrayde
he mighte do vs boþe a vilonye
Aleyn answerd I count it nat a flye
And vp he roos and by þe wenche crepte
This wenche lay vpright and faste slepte
Til he so neih was or sche might aspye
That it had ben to late for to crye
And schortly for to seye þey weren at oon
Now pley aleyn for I wol speke of Ion
 This Iohn lith stille a forlong whyle or two
And to him self compleyned of his woo
Allas quod he þis is a wikked Iape 
Now may I say þat I am but an ape
Ȝet haþ my felaw somwat for his harm
he haþ þe myllers doughter in his arm


he auntred him and has his needes sped
And I lye as a draf sak in my bed
And when þis Iape is tald anoþer day
I sal be held a daf a cokenay
vnhardy is vnsely as men saith
I wol arise and auntre it in good faiþ
And vp he ros and softely he wente 
vnto þe cradil and in his hand it hente
And bar it softe vnto his beddis feet
Soone after þis þe wyf hir routyng leet 
And gan awake and went hir for to pisse
And cam agayn and gan hir cradel mysse
And groped heer and þer but sche fond noon
Allas quod sche  I had almost mys goon
I had almost goon to þe clerkes bed
Ey bendicite þan had I foule Isped
And forþ sche goþ til sche þe cradil fand  
Sche gropith alway forther with hir hand
And fand þe bed and þoughte nat but good
By cause þat þe cradil by hit stood
Nat knowyng wher sche was for it was derk
But fair and wel sche creep in to þe clerk
And lith ful stille and wolde han caught a sleep
wiþinne a while Iohn þe clerk vp leep
And on this goode wyf leyþ on ful sore
So mery a fytt ne hadd sche nat ful ȝore
he prikeþ harde and deepe as he were mad
This Ioly lyf han þis twey clerkes had
Til þat þe þridde cok bygan to synge
Aleyn wax wery in þe dawenynge
For he had swonken al þe longe night
And seyd far wel malyn my sweete wight
The day is come I may no lenger byde 
But euermo wher so I go or ryde
I am þin owen clerk so haue I seel
Now deere lemman quod sche go far wel


But or þou go o thing I wol þe telle
whan þat þou wendist homward by þe melle
Right at þe entre of þe dore byhynde
Thou schalt a cake of half a busshel fynde
That was Imaked of þyn owen mele
Which þat I hilp myn owen self to stele
And goode lemman god þe saue and kepe
And wiþ þat word almost sche gan to weepe
Aleyn vprist and þought er þat it dawe
I wol go crepen in by my felawe
And fand þe cradil wiþ his hand anon
By god þought he al wrong I haue Igoon
My heed is toty of my swynk to nyght
That  makes me þat I ga nouȝt aright
I wot wel by þe cradel I haue mys go
heer lith þe myller and his wyf also
Forþ he goþ in twenty deuelway
vnto þe bed þer as þe Miller lay
he wende haue crope by his felaw Ion  
And by þe myller in he creep anon
And caught him by þe nekke and soft he spak
And seyde Ion þou swyneshed awak
For cristes sowle and here a noble game
For by þat lord þat cleped is seynt Iame
As I haue þries in þis schorte night
Swyued þe myllers douȝter bolt vpright
whiles þou hast as a coward ben agast
Ȝe false harlot quod þis mellere hast
A false traitour false clerk quod he
Thou schalt be deed by goddes dignite
who durste be so bold to disparage
My doughter þat is com of hih lynage 
And by þe þrotebolle he caught aleyn
And he hent him dispitously ageyn
And on þe nose he smot him with his fest
Doun ran þe blody streem vpon his brest


And in þe floor wiþ nose and mouþ tobroke
They walweden as pigges in a poke
And vpon þay goon and doun þey goon anon
Til þat þe Millner stumbled at a ston
And doun he felle  bakward on his wyf
That wyste noþing of þis nyce stryf
For sche was falle a sleepe a litel wight
wiþ Ion þe Clerk þat waked al þe night
And wiþ þe falle right out of slepe sche brayde
help holy croys of Bromholme sche sayde
In manus tuas lord to þe I calle 
Awake Symond þe feend is in þin halle
My hert is broken help I am but deed
Ther lythe vpon my wombe and on myn heed
Help Symkyn for þis false clerkes fight
This Iohn stert vp as fast as euer he might
And grasped by þe walles to and fro
To fynde a staf and sche sturt vp also
And knewe þe estres bet þan dede Ion
And by þe wal sche took a staf anon
And sawh a litel glymeryng of light  
For at an hool in schon þe moone light
And by þat light she saugh hem boþe two
But sikirly sche wiste nat who was who
But sche saugh a whit þing in hir ye
And whan sche gan þis white þing aspye
Sche wend þe clerk had wered a volupeer
And wiþ a staf sche drough hir neer and neer
And wend haue hit þis Aleyn atte fulle
And smot þis meller on þe piled sculle
And doun he goþ and cryeþ harrow I dye
This clerkes beeten him wel and leet him lye
And greyth hem wel and take her hors anon
And eek here mele and hoom anon þey goon
And at the Millen dore þey tok here cake
Of half a buisshel flour ful wel Ibake


Thus is þe prowde Miller wel Ibete
And haþ Ilost þe gryndyng of þe whete 
And payed for þe soper euerydel
Of aleyn and of Iohn þat beten him wel
His wyf is swyued and his doughter als
Lo such it is a Miller to be fals
And þerto þis prouerbe is seyd ful soþ
he þar nat weene wel þat euyl doþ
A gylour schal him self bygiled be
And god þat sittest in þy mageste
Saue al þis compaignie gret and smale 
Thus haue I quit þe Miller in his tale 
The Cook of londoun whil þe Reeue spak
For Ioye he þought  he clawed him on þe bak
ha ha quod he  for cristes passioun
This meller haþ a scharp conclusioun 
vpon his argument of herburgage
wel seyde Salomon in his langage 
Ne bryng nat euery man in to þyn hous
For herburgage by night is perilous
wel aught a man avised for to be
whom þat he brought in to his pryuyte  
I pray to god so gyf my body care 
Ȝif euer siþþe I highte hogge of ware
herd I better myller set a werke 
he hadde a Iape of malice in þe derke 
And þerfore if ȝe fouche sauf to heere
But god forbede þat we stynten heere 
A tale of me þat am a pouer man
I wol ȝow telle as wel as I kan
A litel Iape þat fel in oure cite
Oure host seyde I graunt it the
Now telle on Roger and loke it be good
For many a pastey hastow lete blood
And many a Iakk of douer hastow sold
That haþ be twyes hoot and twyes cold
Of many a pilgrym hastow cristes curs
For þy persly þey faren ȝet þe wors
That they haue eten wiþ þe stubbil goos
For in þy schoppe is many a flye loos
Now goode  gentil Roger by þy name 
But ȝit I pray þe be nought wroþ for game
    
Thow saist ful soþ quod Roger by my faith


But soth play quad play as þe flemyng saith
    
Be thou nat wroþ or we departe her
Though þat my tale be of an hostyler
But naþeles I wol not telle it ȝit
But or we departe it schal be quyt
And þer wiþ al he lowh  and made chere
And seyde his tale as ȝe schal after heere
A Prentys dwelled whilom in oure Citee
Of a craft of vitaillers was he
Gaylard he was as goldfynch in þe schawe 
Broun as a bery and a propre felawe
wiþ lokkes blak and kempt ful fetously
Dauncen he cowde wel and prately
That he was cleped Perkyn reuellour
he was ful of loue and paramour
As is þe hony combe of hony swete
wel were þe wenche þat mighte him meete  
    
    
FOr whan þer eny rydyng was in cheepe 
Out of þe schoppe þider wolde he lepe 
Tyl he hadde al þat sight Iseyn
And daunced wel he nold nat come ageyn
And gadred him a meyne of his sort
To hoppe and synge and make such disport
And þer þey setten steuene for to meete
To pleyen atte dys in such a strete
For in þe toun ne was þer no prentys
That fairer cowde caste a peyre dys
Than Perkyn couþe and þerto he was free 
Of his dispence in place of pryuyte
That fand his mayster wel in his chaffare
For often tyme he fond his box ful bare
For such a ioly prentys reuelour
That haunteþ dys Reuel or paramour
his maister schal it in his schoppe abye
Al haue he no part of þe mynstralcye
For þefte and ryot be conuertyble
Al can þey pley on giterne and rubible


Reuel and trouþe as in a lowe degre
They ben ful wroþ al day as ȝe may see
This Ioly Prentys with his mayster bood
Til he was oute neyȝ of his prentys hood
Al were he snybbyd boþe erly and late
And som tyme lad with reuel in to Newgate
But atte laste his mayster him bythought
vpon a day whan he his papyr sought
Of a prouerbe þat siþ þis same word
wel bette is roten appul out of hord
Than it rote al þe remenaunt
So fareth it by a ryotous seruaunt
hit is ful lasse harm to late him pa
Than he schend al þe seruauntes in þe place
Therfore his mayster ȝaf him acqueyntaunce
And bad him go wiþ sorwe and wiþ meschaunce
And þus þe ioly prentys had his leue 
Now let hym ryot al þe night or leue
LItheth and lestneþ and herkneþ aright  
And ȝe schul heere a talkyng of a doughty knight
Sire Iohn of Boundys was his right name
he cowde of norture ynough and mochil of game
Thre sones þe knight · þat with his body he wan
The eldest was a moche schrewe  and sone he bygan
his breþeren loued wel here fader  and of him were agast 
The eldest deserued his fadres curs  and had it at þe last 
The goode kniȝt his fader lyuede so ȝore
That deth was comen him to and handled him ful sore
The goode knight cared sore  sik þer he lay
how his children scholde lyuen after his day
he hadde ben wyde wher  but non housbond he was
Al þe lond þat he had  it was verrey purchas
Fayn he wold it were dressed  amonges hem alle
That ech of hem had his part  as it might falle 
Tho sent he in to cuntre after wise knightes
To helpe delen his londes  and dressen hem to rightes
he sent hem word by lettres  þey schulden hye blyue
yf þey wolde speke with him whil he was on lyue 


 Tho þe knyghtes herden  sik þer he lay
hadde þey no reste noþer night ne day
Til þey comen to him þer he lay stille 
On his deþ bedde  to abyde goddes wille
Þan seyde þe goode knight syk þer he lay
lordes I ȝou warne for soþ wiþoute nay
I may no lengere lyuen heer in þis stounde
For þurgh goddes wille deþ draweth me to grounde
Ther nas non of hem alle  þat herd him aright
Þat þey hadden reuþe of þat ilke knight
And seyde sir for goddes loue ne dismay ȝou nought
God may do bote of bale þat is now Iwrought
 Than spak þe goode knight sik þer he lay
Boote of bale god may sende I wot it is no nay
But I byseke ȝou kniȝtes for þe loue of me
Goþ and dresseþ my lond among my sones þre
And sires for þe loue of god deleþ hem nat amys
And forgetiþ nat Gamelyn my ȝonge sone þat is
Takeþ heed to þat on as wel as to þat oþer  
Selde ȝe see ony Eyr helpen his broþer
 þo leete þey þe knight lyen þat was nought in hele 
And wenten in to counseil his londes for to dele 
For to delen hem alle  to oon þat was her þought
And for Gamelyn was ȝongest  he schuld haue nouȝt
Al þe lond þat þer was þey dalten it in two
And leeten Gamelyn þe ȝonge wiþoute lond go
And ech of hem seyde to oþer ful lowde
His breþeren might ȝeue him lond whan he good cowde
whan þey hadde deled þe lond at here wille
þey come aȝein to þe knight þer he lay ful stille
And tolden him anonright  how þey hadden wrought
And þe knight þere he lay liked it right nought
Than seyde þe knight  by seynt Martyn
For al þat ȝe haue ydoon ȝit is the lond myn
For goddes loue neyhebours stondeþ alle stille
And I wil dele my lond  after my wille


Iohan myn eldeste sone  schal haue plowes fyue
That was my fadres heritage whil he was on lyue
And my myddeleste sone  fyf plowes of lond
That I halp for to gete wiþ my right hond
And al myn other purchas  of londes and leedes
Þat I byqueþe gamelyn  and alle my goode steedes
And I byseke ȝow goode men þat lawe conne of londe
For Gamelynes loue þat my queste stonde
Thus dalte þe knight his lond by his day
Right on his deþ bed  sik þer he lay
And sone aftirward he lay stoon stille 
And deyde whan tyme com  as it was cristes wille
And anon as he was deed and vnder gras Igraue 
Sone þe elder broþer gyled þe ȝonge knaue
He took in to his hond  his lond as his leede
And Gamelyn himselfe  to clothen and to feede
He clothed him and fed him yuel and eek wroþe
And leet his londes forfare and his houses boþe
his parkes and his woodes  and dede noþing wel
And seþþen he it abought on his faire fel
So longe was Gamelyn in his broþeres halle  
For þe strengest of good wil þey doutiden him alle 
Þer was non þer Inne nowþer ȝong ne olde
That wolde wraþþe Gamelyn were he neuer so bolde 
Gamelyn stood on a day in his broþeres ȝerde
And bygan wiþ his hond to handlen his berde
he þought on his londes þat layen vnsawe
And his faire Okes þat doun were Idrawe
his parkes were Ibroken  and his deer byreeued
Of alle his goode steedes noon was him byleued
his howses were vnhiled  and ful yuel dight
Tho þoughte Gamelyn it wente nought aright
Afterward cam his broþer walkynge þare
And seyde to Gamelyn is our mete ȝare 
Tho wraþþed him gamelyn and swor by goddes book
Thou schalt go bake þi self  I wil nouȝt be þy cook


how broþer Gamelyn  how answerest þou now 
þou spake neuer such a word as þou dost now 
By my faith seyde Gamelyn now me þinkeþ neede 
Of alle þe harmes þat I haue I tok neuer ar heede
My parkes ben tobroken and my deer byreued
Of myn armure and my steedes nought is me bileued
Al þat my fader me byquaþ al goþ to schame 
And þerfor haue þou goddes curs broþer by þy name
Than byspak his broþer þat rape was of rees 
Stond stille gadelyng  and hold right þy pees 
Thou schalt be fayn for to haue þy mete and þy wede 
what spekest þou Gamelyn of lond oþer of leede
Thanne seyde Gamelyn þe child þat was ying
Cristes curs mot he haue þat clepeþ me gadelyng
I am no worse gadelyng ne no worse wight
But born of a lady and geten of a knight
Ne durst he nat to Gamelyn ner a foote go
But clepide to him his men and seyde to hem þo
Goþ and beteþ þis boy and reueþ him his wyt 
And lat him leren anoþer tyme to answere me bet
Thanne seyde þe child ȝonge Gamelyn
Cristes curs mot þou haue broþer art þou myn
And if I schal algate be beten anon  
Cristes curs mot þou haue but þou be þat oon
And anon his broþer in þag grete hete
Made his men to fette staues Gamelyn to bete
whan þat euerich of hem  a staf had Inome
Gamelyn was war anon þo he seigh hem come
þo gamelyn seyh hem come  he loked ouer al
And was war of a pestel stood vnder a wal
Gamelyn was light of foot  and þider gan he lepe
And drof alle his broþeres men right on an hepe
he loked as a wilde lyoun and leyde on good woon
Tho his broþer say þat he bigan to goon ·
he fley vp in til a loft and schette þe dore fast
Thus Gamelyn wiþ þe pestel made hem alle agast


Some for Gamelynes loue  and some for his eyȝe 
Alle þey drowe by halues  þo he gan to pleyȝe 
what how now seyde Gamelyn euel mot ȝe thee
wil ȝe bygynne contek and so sone flee 
Gamelyn sought his broþer  whider he was flowe
And saugh wher he loked out  at a wyndowe 
Broþer sayde Gamelyn com a litel ner
And I wil teche þe a play atte bokeler
his broþer him answerde and swor by seynt Rycher
whil þe pestel is in þin hond I wil come no neer
Broþer I wil make þy pees  I swere by cristes ore
Cast away þe pestel and wraþþe þe nomore 
I mot neede sayde Gamelyn wraþþe me at oones
For thou wolde make þy men to breke myne boones
Ne had I hadde mayn and might in myn armes
To haue Iput hem fro me he wolde haue do me harmes
Gamelyn sayde his broþer be þou nought wroþ
For to seen þe haue harm it were me right loþ
I ne dide it nouȝt broþer but for a fondyng
For to loken or þou were strong and art so ying
Com a doun þan to me and graunte me my bone
Of þing I wil þe aske  and we schul saughte sone
Doun þan cam his broþer þat fykil was and felle
And was swiþe sore agast of þe pestelle
he seyde broþer Gamelyn aske me þy boone  
And loke þou me blame but I graunte sone
Thanne seyde Gamelyn broþer Iwys
And we schulle ben at oon þou most me graunte þis
Al þat my fader me byquath whil he was on lyue 
Þou most do me it haue ȝif we schul nat stryue 
That schalt þou haue Gamelyn I swere by cristes ore
Al þat þi fader the byquaþ þough þou woldest haue more
Thy lond þat lyþ laye ful wel it schal be sowe
And þyn howses reysed vp þat ben leyd so lowe
Thus seyde þe knight to Gamelyn wiþ mowthe 
And þought eek of falsnes  as he wel couþe 


The king þought on tresoun  and Gamelyn on noon
And went and kist his broþer  and whan þey were at oon
Allas ȝonge Gamelyn noþing he ne wiste 
wiþ which a false tresoun his broþer him kiste 
LIþeth and lestneþ and holdeþ ȝour tonge
And ȝe schul heere talkyng of Gamelyn þe yonge
Ther was þer bysiden cryed a wrastlyng
And þerfor þer was sette vp a Ram and a Ryng
And Gamelyn was in good wil to wende þerto 
For to preuen his might what he cowþe do
Broþer seyde Gamelyn by seynt Richer
Thou most lene me to nyȝt  a litel Courser
That is freisch to the spore on for to ryde
I most on an Erande a litel her byside
By god seyd his brother of steedes in my stalle
Go and chese þe þe best and spare non of alle
Of steedes or of course þat stonden hem bisyde
And tel me goode broþer whider þou wolt ryde
 her byside broþer is cryed a wrastlyng
And þerfor schal be set vp a Ram and a Ryng
Moche worschip it were broþer to vs alle
Might I þe Ram and þe Ryng bryng home to þis halle
A steede þer was sadeled smertely and skeet
Gamelyn did a paire spores fast on his feet
he set his foot in styrop  þe steede he bystrood
And toward þe wrastelyng þe ȝonge child rood
Tho Gamelyn þe yonge was ride out at þe gate  
The fals kniȝt his broþer lokked it after þate
And bysoughte ihū crist þat is heuen kyng
he mighte breke his nekke in þat wrastlyng
As sone as Gamelyn com þer þe place was 
he lighte doun of his steede and stood on þe gras 
And þer he herd a Frankeleyn wayloway syng
And bigan bitterly his hondes for to wryng
Goode man seyde Gamelyn why makestow þis fare
Is þer no man þat may ȝou helpe out of þis care


Allas seyde þis Frankeleyn þat euer was I bore
For tweye stalworþe sones  I wene þat I haue lore
A Champioun is in þe place  þat haþ Iwrought me sorwe
For he haþ slayn my two sones  but if god hem borwe 
I wold ȝeue ten pound by ihū crist and more
wiþ þe nones I fand a man to handil him sore
Goode man seyde Gamelyn wilt þou wel doon
hold myn hors whil my man draweþ of my schoon ·
And help my man to kepe my cloþes and my steede 
And I wil in to place go  to loke if I may speede 
By god sayde þe Frankeleyn anon it schal be doon
I wil my self be þy man  and drawen of þy schoon
And wende þou in to þe place  ihū crist þe speede 
And drede not of þy cloþes nor of þy goode steede 
BArfoot and vngert  Gamelyn in cam
Alle þat weren in þe place heede of him þey nam
how he durst auntre him of him to doon his might
That was so doughty champioun in wrastlyng and in fight
vp sterte þe Champioun raply and anoon
Toward ȝonge Gamelyn  he bigan to goon
And sayde who is þy fader and who is þy sire
For soþe þou art a gret fool þat þou come hire
Gamelyn answerde þe champioun tho
þou knewe wel my fader  whil he couþe go
whiles he was on lyue  by seint martyn
Sir Iohn of Boundys was his name and I gamelyn
Felaw seyde þe champioun al so mot I þryue
I knew wel þy fader whil he was on lyue
And þiself Gamelyn I wil þat þou it heere  
whil þou were a ȝong boy a moche schrewe þou were
þan seyde Gamelyn and swor by cristes ore
Now I am older woxe þou schalt me fynd a more
By god sayde þe Champioun welcome mote þou be
Come þou ones in myn hond schalt þou neuer þe
It was wel wiþinne þe night and þe moone schon
whan Gamelyn and þe Champioun togider gon to goon


The champioun caste tornes to Gamelyn þat was prest
And Gamelyn stood stille and bad him doon his best
Thanne seyde Gamelyn to þe Champioun
Thou art fast aboute to brynge me a doun
Now I haue Iproued many tornes of þyne
Thow most he seyde prouen on or tuo of myne
Gamelyn to þe Champioun ȝede smartly anon
Of alle þe tornes þat he cowþe he schewed him but oon
And kast him on þe left syde þat þre ribbes tobrak
And þerto his oon arm þat ȝaf a gret crak
Thanne seyde Gamelyn smertly anoon
Schal it be holde for a cast or elles for noon
By god seyd þe Champioun wheþer þat it bee
he þat comes ones in þin hand schal he neuer þee
Than seyde þe Frankeleyn  þat had his sones þere
Blessed be þou gamelyn þat euer þou bore were
The Frankleyn seyd to þe Champioun of him stood him noon eye
This is yonge Gamelyn þat taughte þe þis pleye
Aȝein answerd the Champioun þat liked no þing well
he is a liþer mayster and his pley is riȝt fell
Siþ I wrastled first  it is Igo ful ȝore
But I was neuere my lyf handled so sore
Gamelyn stood in þe place allone wiþoute serk
And seyd if þer be eny mo lat hem come to werk
The Champioun þat peyned him to werke so sore
It semeþ by his continaunce þat he wil nomore
Gamelyn in þe place  stood as stille as stoon·
For to abyde wrastelyng but þer com noon
Ther was noon with Gamelyn wolde wrastle more 
For he handled þe Champioun so wonderly sore 
Two gentil men þer were þat yemede þe place  
Comen to Gamelyn god ȝeue him goode grace
And sayde to him do on  þyn hosen and þy schoon
For soþe at þis tyme þis feire is Idoon·
And þan seyde Gamelyn so mot I wel fare 
I haue nought ȝet haluendel sold vp my ware 


Tho seyde þe Champioun so brouk I my sweere
he is a fool þat þer of beyeþ  þou sellest it so deere
Tho sayde þe Frankeleyn þat was in moche care
Felaw he seyde  why lakkest þou his ware 
By seynt Iame in Galys þat many man haþ sought
Ȝet it is to good cheep þat þou hast Ibought
Tho þat wardeynes were of þat wrastlyng
Come and broughte Gamelyn þe Ram and þe Ryng
And seyden haue Gamelyn þe Ryng and þe Ram
For þe best wrasteler þat euer here cam·
Thus wan Gamelyn þe Ram and þe Ryng
And wente wiþ moche ioye home in þe mornyng
His broþer seih wher he cam with þe grete rowte 
And bad schitte þe gate and holde him wiþoute
The porter of his lord was ful sore agast
And stert anon to þe gate and lokked it fast
NOw litheþ and lestneþ boþe ȝong and olde
And ȝe schul heere gamen of Gamelyn þe bolde
Gamelyn com þerto for to haue comen In
And þanne was it Ischet faste wiþ a pyn
Than seyde Gamelyn porter vndo þe yate
For many good mannes sone stondeþ þerate
Than answerd þe porter and swor by goddes berd
Thow ne schalt Gamelyn come in to þis ȝerde
Thow lixt sayde Gamelyn so browke I my chyn
he smot þe wyket wiþ his foot and brak awey þe pyn
The porter seyh þo it might no better be
He sette foot on erþe he bigan to flee
By my faiþ seyde Gamelyn þat trauail is Ilore
For I am of foot as light as þou þough þou haddest swore
Gamelyn ouertook þe porter and his teene wrak
And gert him in þe nekke þat þe bon tobrak
And took him by þat oon arm and þrew him in a welle  
Seuen fadmen it was deep  as I haue herd telle 
whan Gamelyn þe yonge þus hadde pleyd his play
Alle þat in þe ȝerde were drewen hem a way


Þey dredden him ful sore for werkes þat he wrouȝte
And for þe faire company þat he þider broughte
Gamelyn ȝede to þe gate  and leet it vp wyde
he leet in alle maner men þat gon in wold or ryde
And seyde ȝe be welcome wiþouten eny greeue 
For we wiln be maistres heer  and aske no man leue 
Ȝestirday I lefte  seyde ȝonge Gamelyn·
In my broþer Seller v tonne of wyn
I wil not þat þis compaignye parten atwynne 
And ȝe wil doon after me while eny sope is þrynne
And if my broþer grucche or make foul cheere
Oþer for spense of mete or drynk þat we spenden heere 
I am oure catour  and bere oure aller purs 
he schal haue for his grucchyng seint maries curs
My broþer is a nyggoun  I swer by cristes ore
And we wil spende largely þat he haþ spared ȝore 
And who þat makeþ grucchyng  þat we here dwelle
he schal to þe porter in to þe drawwelle
vij dayes and vij nyght Gamelyn held his feste
with moche myrþ and solas  þat was þer and no cheste 
In a litel toret his brother lay Isteke
And sey hem wasten his good but durst he not speke
Erly on a mornyng on þe viije day
The gestes come to Gamelyn and wolde gon here way
Lordes seyde Gamelyn  wil ȝe so hye
Al þe wyn is not ȝet ydronke so brouk I myn ye
Gamelyn in his herte was he ful wo
whan his gestes took her leue from him for to go
he wold þey had lenger abide  and þey seyde nay
But bitaughte Gamelyn god and good day
Thus made Gamelyn his fest  and brought it wel to ende
And after his gestys took leue to wende
LItheþ and lestneþ and holdeþ ȝoure tonge
And ȝe schul heere gamen of Gamelyn þe ȝonge 
herkneþ lordynges and lesteneþ aright  
whan alle gestes were goon how Gamelyn was dight


Al þe whil þat Gamelyn heeld his mangerye
his broþer þought on him be wreke  wiþ his treccherie
Tho Gamelyns gestes were riden and Igoon
Gamelyn stood allone frendes had he noon
Tho after ful soone wiþinne a litel stounde
Gamelyn was Itake and ful hard Ibounde
Forþ com þe fals knight out of þe selleer
To Gamelyn his broþer he ȝede ful neer
And sayde to Gamelyn who made þe so bold
For to stroye my stoor of myn houshold
Broþer seyde Gamelyn wraþþe þe right nouȝt
For it is many day Igon siþþen it was bouȝt
For broþer þou hast Ihad by seynt richer
Of xv plowes of lond þis xvj ȝer
And of alle þe beestes þou hast forþ bred
That my fader me biquath on his deth bed
Of al þis xvj ȝeer I ȝeue þe þe prow
For þe mete and þe drynk þat we haue spended now 
Thanne seyde þe fals knyȝt euel mot he the
Herkne broþer Gamelyn what I wol ȝeue þe
For of my body broþer geten heir haue I noon
I wil make þe myn heir I swere by seint Iohn
Par ma foy sayd Gamelyn and if it so be
And þou þenke as þou seyst god ȝelde it þe
No þing wiste Gamelyn of his broþeres gyle
Therfore he him bigyled in a litel while
Gamelyn seyde he o thing I þe telle
Tho þou þrewe my porter in þe drawwelle
I swor in þat wraþþe and in þat grete moot
That þou schuldest be bounde boþe hand and foot
Therfore I þe biseche brother Gamelyn
Lat me nought be forsworn broþer art þou myn
lat me bynde þe now boþe hand and feet
For to holde myn avow as I þe biheet
Broþer sayde Gamelyn also mot I þe
Thou schalt not be forsworen for þe loue of me


Tho made þey Gamelyn to sitte might he nat stonde  
Til þey had him bounde boþe foot and honde 
The fals knight his broþer of Gamelyn was agast
And sent aftir feteres to feteren him fast
His broþer made lesynges on him þer he stood
And told hem þat comen In þat Gamelyn was wood
Gamelyn stood to a post bounden in þe halle 
Tho þat comen in þer loked on him alle 
Euer stood Gamelyn euen vpright
But mete ne drynk had he non neiþer day ne night
Than seyde Gamelyn broþer by myn hals
Now I haue aspied þou art a party fals 
had I wist þat tresoun þat þou haddest yfounde
I wolde haue ȝeue þe strokes or I had be bounde 
Gamelyn stood bounden stille as eny stoon·
Two dayes and two nightes mete had he noon
Thanne seyde Gamelyn þat stood ybounde stronge 
Adam Spencer me þinkþ I faste to longe
Adam Spencer now I byseche þe
For þe mochel loue my fader loued þe
yf þou may come to þe keyes lese me out of bond
And I wil parte wiþ þe of my free lond
Thanne seyde adam þat was þe Spencer
I haue serued þy broþer þis xvj ȝeer
If I leete þe goon out of his bour
he wolde say afterward I were a traytour
Adam sayde Gamelyn so brouk I myn hals
þou schalt fynde my broþer atte laste fals
Therfor broþer adam louse me out of bond
And I wil parte wiþ þe of my free lond
vp swich a forward seyde adam Iwys
I wil do þerto al þat in me is
Adam seyde Gamelyn al so mot I þe
I wol hold þe couenaunt and þou wil me
Anon as adames lord to bedde was Igoon
Adam took þe keyes and leet gamelyn out anoon


He vnlokked Gamelyn boþe hand and feet
In hope of auauncement þat he him byheet
Than seyde Gamelyn þanked be goddes sonde  
Now I am loosed boþe foot and honde 
had I now eten and dronken aright
Ther is noon in þis hous schulde bynde me þis night
Adam took Gamelyn as stille as ony stoon
And ladde him into spence rapely and anon
And sette him to soper right in a priue stede
he bad him do gladly and Gamelyn so dede
Anon as gamelyn hadde eten wel and fyn
And þerto ydronke wel of þe rede wyn
Adam seyde Gamelyn what is now þy reed
wher I go to my broþer and girde of his heed
Gamelyn seyde adam it schal not be so
I can teche þe a reed þat is worþ þe two
I wot wel for soþe þat þis is no nay
we schul haue a mangery right on sonday
Abbotes and priours many heer schal be
And oþer men of holy chirche as I telle þe 
Thow schalt stonde vp by þe post as þou were hondfast
And I schal leue hem vnloke awey þou may hem cast
whan þat þey haue eten and waisschen here hondes
Thou schalt biseke hem alle to bryng þe out of bondes
And if þey wille borwe þe þat were good game
Then were þou out of prisoun and I out of blame
And if euerich of hem say vnto vs nay
I schal do anoþer I swere by þis day
Thou schalt haue a good staf and I wil haue anoþer
And cristes curs haue þat oon þat faileþ þat oþer
Ȝe for gode sayde Gamelyn I say it for me
If I fayle on my syde yuel mot I þe
If we schul algate assoile hem of here synne
warne me broþer adam whan I schal bygynne
Gamelyn seyde adam by seynte charite
I wil warne þe byforn whan þat it schal be


whan I twynk on þe loke for to goon
And cast awey þe feteres and com to me anoon·
Adam seide Gamelyn blessed be þy bones
That is a good counseil ȝeuyng for þe nones
If þey werne me þanne to brynge me out of bendes  
I wol sette goode strokes right on here lendes
Tho þe sonday was Icome and folk to þe feste 
Faire þey were welcomed boþe lest and meste
And euer as þey atte halle dore comen In·
They caste þeir eye on ȝonge Gamelyn
The fals knight his broþer ful of trechery
Alle þe gestes þat þer wer atte mangery
Of Gamelyn his broþer he tolde hem with mouþe
Al þe harm and þe schame þat he telle couþe
Tho þey were serued Of messes tuo oþer þre
Than seyde Gamelyn how serue ȝe me
It is nouȝt wel serued by god þat al made
That I sytte fastyng and oþer men make glade
The fals knight his broþer þer þat he stood
Tolde alle his gestes þat Gamelyn was wood
And Gamelyn stood stille and answerde nought
But adames wordes he held in his þought 
Tho Gamelyn gan speke dolfully wiþ alle 
To þe grete lordes þat saten in þe halle
lordes he seyde for cristes passioun
helpeþ brynge Gamelyn out of prisoun
Than seyde an abbot sorwe on his cheeke
he schal haue cristes curs and seynte maries eeke
That þe out of prisoun beggeþ oþer borwe
But euer worthe hem wel þat doþ þe moche sorwe
After þat abbot þan spak anoþer
I wold þin heed were of þough þou were my broþer
Alle þat þe borwe  foule mot hem falle
Thus þey seyde alle þat were in þe halle
Than seyde a priour yuel mot he þryue
It is moche skaþe boy þat þou art on lyue


Ow  seyde Gamelyn so brouk I my bon
Now I haue aspyed þat freendes haue I non
Cursed mot he worþe boþe fleisch and blood
That euer do Priour or abbot ony good
Adam þe Spencer took vp þe cloþ
And loked on Gamelyn and say þat he was wroth
Adam on þe pantrye litel he þought   
But tuo goode staues to hall dore he brouȝt
Adam loked on Gamelyn and he was war anoon
And cast awey þe feteres and he bigan to goon
Tho he com to adam he took þat oo staf
And bygan to worche and goode strokes ȝaf
Gamelyn cam into þe halle and þe spencer boþe
And loked hem aboute as þey had be wroþe
Gamelyn sprengeþ holywater wiþ an Oken spire 
That some þat stoode vpright fel in þe fire
Ther was no lewede man þat in þe halle stood
That wolde do Gamelyn eny þing but good
But stood besyde and leet hem boþe werche
For þey hadde no rewþe of men of holy cherche
Abbot or priour monk or Chanoun
That Gamelyn ouertok anon þey ȝeeden doun
Ther was non of hem alle þat wiþ his staf mette
That he made him ouerþrowe and quyt him his dette
Gamelyn seyde adam for seynte charite
Pay large lyuerey for þe loue of me
And I wil kepe þe dore so euer here I masse 
Er þey ben assoyled þere schan noon passe
Dowt þe nought seyde Gamelyn whil we ben in feere
kep þou wel þe dore  and I wol werche heere
Stere þe good adam and lat þer noon flee
And we schul telle largely how many þer be
Gamelyn seyde adam do hem but good
Þey ben men of holy chirche  draw of hem no blood
Saue wel þe croune and do hem non harmes
But brek boþe her legges and siþþen here armes


Thus Gamelyn and adam wroughte right fast
And pleyden wiþ þe monkes and made hem agast
Thider þey come rydyng iolily wiþ swaynes
And hom aȝen þey were Ilad in cartes and in waynes
Tho þey hadden al ydon þan seyde a gray frere
Allas sire abbot what dide we now heere
Tho þat comen hider it was a cold reed
vs hadde ben better at home wiþ water and breed
Whil Gamelyn made ordres of monkes and frere   
Euer stood his broþer and made foul chere 
Gamelyn vp wiþ his staf þat he wel knew
And gert him in þe nekke þat he ouerþrew
Alitel aboue þe girdel þe Riggebon tobarst
And sette him in þe feteres þer he sat arst
Sitte þer broþer sayde Gamelyn·
For to colyn þy blood as I dide myn
As swiþe as þey hadde  Iwroken hem on here foon
They askeden watir and wisschen anoon
what some for here loue and some for awe 
Alle þe seruantȝ serued hem of þe beste lawe 
The scherreue was þennes but a fyue myle
And al was ytold him in a litel while
How Gamelyn and adam had doon a sory rees
Bounden and Iwounded men aȝein þe kinges pees
Tho bigan sone strif for to wake 
And þe scherref aboute Gamelyn for to take 
NOw lytheþ and lestneþ so god ȝif ȝou goode fyn
And ȝe schul heere good game of ȝonge Gamelyn
Four and twenty ȝonge men þat heelden hem ful bolde
Come to þe schirref and seyde þat þey wolde 
Gamelyn and adam fetten away
The scherref ȝaf hem leue soþ as I ȝou say
They hyeden faste wold þey nought bylynne 
Til þey come to þe ȝate þer Gamelyn was Inne
They knokked on þe gate þe porter was ny
And loked out at an hol as man þat was sly


The porter hadde byholde hem a litel while 
he loued wel Gamelyn and was adrad of gyle
And leet þe wyket stonden ysteke ful stylle
And asked hem wiþoute what was here wille
For al þe grete company þanne spak but oon
Vndo þe gate porter and lat vs in goon
Than seyde þe porter so brouke I my chyn
ȝe schul sey ȝour erand er ȝe comen In
Sey to Gamelyn and adam if here wille be
we wil speke wiþ hem wordes two or þre
Felaw seyde þe porter stond þere stille  
And I wil wende to Gamelyn to witen his wille
In went þe porter to Gamelyn anoon
And seyde sir I warne ȝou her ben come ȝour foon
The scherreues meyne ben atte gate 
For to take ȝou boþe schul ȝe na skape 
Porter seyde Gamelyn so moot I wel þe 
I wil allowe þe þy wordes whan I my tyme se
Go agayn to þe ȝate and dwel wiþ hem a while
And þou schalt se right sone porter a gyle
Adam sayde Gamelyn looke þe to goon
we haue foomen atte gate and frendes neuer oon
It ben þe schirrefes men þat hider ben Icome 
They ben swore togidere þat we schul be nome 
Gamelyn seyde adam hye þe right blyue 
And if I faile þe þis day euel mot I þryue
And we schul so welcome þe scherreues men
That som of hem schul make here beddes in þe den
Atte posterne gate Gamelyn out went 
And a good cart staf in his hand he hente
Adam hente sone anoþer gret staf
For to helpe Gamelyn and goode strokes ȝaf
Adam felde tweyne and Gamelyn felde þre
The oþer setten feet on erþe and bygonne fle
what seyde adam so euer here I masse
I haue a draught of good wyn  drynk er ȝe passe 


Nay by god sayde þay  þy drynk is not good
It wolde make mannes brayn to lien in his hood
Gamelyn stood stille and loked him aboute
And seih þe scherreue come with a gret route 
Adam seyde Gamelyn what be now þy reedes
Here comþ þe scherreue and wil haue oure heedes
Adam sayde Gamelyn my reed is now þis
Abide we no lenger lest we fare amys
I rede þat we to wode goon ar þat we be founde
Better is vs þer loos þan in town ybounde 
Adam took by þe hond ȝonge Gamelyn
And euerich of hem tuo drank a draught of wyn
And after took her coursers and wenten her way  
Tho fond þe scherreue nest but non ay
The scherreue lighte adoun and went in to þe halle 
And fond þe lord yfetered faste wiþ alle
The scherreue vnfetered him sone and þat anoon
And sent after a leche to hele his rigge boon
LEte we now þis fals knight  lyen in his care
And talke we of Gamelyn and loke how he fare
Gamelyn in to þe woode stalkede stille
And adam þe Spenser liked ful ylle 
Adam swor to Gamelyn by seynt Richer
Now I see it is mery to be a Spencer
That leuer me were  keyes for to bere 
Than walken in þis wilde woode my clothes to tere 
Adam seyde Gamelyn dismaye þe right nought
Many good mannes child in care is Ibrought
And as þey stoode talkyng boþen in feere 
Adam herd talkyng of men and neyh him þought þei were
Tho Gamelyn vnder þe woode loked aright
vij score of ȝonge men he saugh wel a dight
Alle satte atte mete compas aboute 
Adam seyde Gamelyn now haue we no doute
After bale comeþ boote þurgh grace of god almight
Me þynkeþ of mete and drynk þat I haue a sight


Adam lokede þo vnder woode bowȝ
And whan he seyh mete he was glad ynough
For he hopede to god for to haue his deel
And he was sore alonged after a good meel
As he seyde þat word þe mayster outlawe
Saugh Gamelyn and adam vnder woode schawe 
Ȝonge men seyde þe maister by þe goode roode
I am war of gestes  god send vs non but goode
Ȝonder ben tuo ȝonge men wonder wel adight
And parauenture þer ben mo  whoso loked aright
Ariseþ vp ȝe ȝonge men and fetteþ hem to me 
It is good þat we witen what men þey bee 
Vp þer sterten seuene  fro þe dyner
And metten with Gamelyn and adam Spenser
whan þey were neyh hem þan seyde þat oon  
Ȝeldeth vp ȝonge men ȝour bowes and ȝour floon ·
Thanne seyde Gamelyn þat yong was of elde
Moche sorwe mot he haue þat to ȝou hem ȝelde 
I curse non oþer but right my selue
Þey ȝe fette to ȝow fyue þanne ȝe be twelue 
Tho þey herde by his word þat might was in his arm
Ther was non of hem alle  þat wolde do him harm
But sayd vnto gamelyn myldely and stille
Com afore our maister and sey to him þy wille
yonge men sayde Gamelyn by ȝour lewte
what man is ȝour maister þat ȝe wiþ be
Alle þey answerde wiþoute lesyng
Oure maister is Icrouned of outlawes kyng
Adam seyde Gamelyn gowe in cristes name 
he may neyþer mete ne drynk werne vs for schame 
If þat he be heende and come of gentil blood
he wol ȝeue vs mete an drynk and doon vs som good
By seynt Iame seyd adam  what harm þat I gete 
I wil auntre to þe dore þat I hadde mete
Gamelyn and adam wente forþ in feere
And þey grette þe maister þat þey founde þere


Than seide þe maister kyng of outlawes
what seeke ȝe ȝonge men vnder woode schawes
Gamelyn answerde þe kyng wiþ his croune 
he moste needes walke in woode þat may not walke in towne 
Sire we walke not heer noon harm for to do
But if we meete wiþ a deer to scheete þerto 
As men þat ben hungry and mow no mete fynde
And ben harde bystad vnder woode lynde
Of Gamelynes wordes þe maister hadde rouþe 
And seyde ȝe schal haue ynough haue god my trouþe 
he bad hem sitte þer adoun for to take reste 
And bad hem ete and drynke and þat of þe beste 
As þey sete and eeten and dronke wel and fyn ·
Than seyd þat oon to þat oþer  þis is Gamelyn
Tho was þe maister outlawe in to counseil nome
And told how it was Gamelyn þat þider was Icome 
Anon as he herde how it was bifalle  
he made him maister vnder him ouer hem alle 
wiþin þe þridde wyke him com tydyng
To þe maister outlawe þat þo was her kyng
That he schulde come hom his pees was Imade
And of þat goode tydyng he was þo ful glad
Tho seyde he to his ȝonge men soþ for to telle 
Me ben comen tydynges I may no lenger dwelle 
Tho was Gamelyn anon wiþoute taryyng
Made maister outlawe and crouned her kyng
 Tho was Gamelyn crouned kyng of outlawes
And walked a while vnder woode schawes
The fals knight his broþer was scherreue and sire
And leet his broþer endite for hate and for Ire 
Tho were his bondemen sory and noþing glade
whan Gamelyn her lord woluesheed was cryed and made
And sente out of his men wher þey might him fynde
For to seke Gamelyn vnder woode lynde 
To telle him tydynges how þe wynd was went
And al his good reued and his men schent


 whan þey had him founde on knees þey hem sette 
And adoun wiþ here hood and here lord grette 
Sire wraþþe ȝou nought for þe goode roode 
For we haue brought ȝou tydynges but þey be nat goode
Now is þy broþer scherreue and haþ þe baillye
And he haþ endited þe and woluesheed doþ þe crie
 Allas seyde Gamelyn þat euer I was so slak
Þat I ne hadde broke his nekke þo his Rigge brak
Goþ greteþ hem wel myn housbondes and wyf
I wol ben atte nexte schire haue god my lyf
Gamelyn came wel redy to þe nexte schire
And þer was his broþer boþe lord and sire 
Gamelyn com boldelych in to þe moot halle
And put a doun his hood among þe lordes alle
God saue ȝou alle lordynges þat now here be
But Brokebak Scherreue euel mot þou þe 
why hast þou do me þat schame and vilonye 
For to late endite me and woluesheed me crye
Tho þought þe fals knight for to ben awreke  
And leet take Gamelyn most he nomore speke
Might þer be nomore grace but Gamelyn atte last
was cast in to prisoun and fetered ful fast
Gamelyn haþ a broþer þat highte sir Ote
As good a knight and heende as mighte gon on foote
Anon þer ȝede a messager to þat goode knight
And told him altogidere how Gamelyn was dight
Anon as sire Ote herde how Gamelyn was a dight
he was wonder sory was he no þing light
And leet sadle a steede and þe way he nam
And to his tweyne breþeren anon right he cam
Sire seyde sire Ote to þe scherreue þo 
we ben but thre breþeren schul we neuer be mo
And þou hast yprisoned þe best of vs alle 
Swich anoþer broþer yuel mot him bifalle
Sire Ote seide þe fals knight lat be þi curs 
By god for þy wordes he schal fare þe wurs


To þe kynges prisoun anon he is ynome
And þer he schal abyde til þe Iustice come 
Par de seyde sir Ote better it schal be
I bidde him to maympris þat þou graunt him me
Til þe nexte sittyng of delyueraunce
And þanne lat Gamelyn stande to his chaunce
Broþer in swich a forthward I take him to the 
And by þi fader soule þat þe bygat and me
But if he be redy whan þe Iustice sitte 
Thou schalt bere þe Iuggement for al þi grete witte
I graunte wel seide sir Ote þat it so be
Let delyuer him anon and tak him to me 
Tho was Gamelyn delyuered to sire Ote his broþer
And þat night dwelleden þat on wiþ þat oþer
On þe morn seyde Gamelyn to sir Ote þe heende
Broþer he seide I moot  forsothe fro þe wende
To loke how my ȝonge men leden here lyf
whether þey lyuen in Ioie or elles in stryf
By god seyde sire Ote  þat is a cold reed
Now I see þat al þe cark schall fallen on myn heed
For whan þe Iustice sitte and þou be nought Ifounde
I schal anon be take and in þy stede Ibounde   
Broþer sayde Gamelyn dismaye þe nought
For by seint Iame in gales þat many man haþ sought
If þat god almighty hold my lyf and witt
I wil be þer redy whan þe Iustice sitt
Than seide sir Ote to Gamelyn god schilde þe fro schame
Com whan þou seest tyme  and bring vs out of blame 
LItheþ and lestneþ and holdeþ ȝou stille 
And ȝe schul here how Gamelyn had al his wille 
Gamelyn wente aȝein vnder woode Rys
And fond þere pleying ȝonge men of prys
Tho was ȝonge Gamelyn glad and bliþe ynough
whan he fond his mery men vnder woode bough
Gamelyn and his men talked in feere 
And þey hadde good game here maister to heere


They tolden him of auentures þat þey hadde founde 
And Gamelyn hem tolde aȝein how he was fast Ibounde
whil Gamelyn was outlawed had he no cors
There was no man þat for him ferde þe wors
But abbotes and priours monk and Chanoun
On hem left he no þing whan he might hem nom
whil Gamelyn and his men made merþes ryue
The fals knight his broþer yuel mot he þryue 
For he was fast about boþe day and oþer
For to hyre þe quest to hangen his broþer
Gamelyn stood on a day and as he biheeld
The woodes and þe schawes in þe wilde feeld
he þought on his broþer how he him beheet
That he wolde be redy whan þe Iustice seet
he þoughte wel þat he wolde wiþoute delay
Come afore þe Iustice to kepen his day
And seide to his ȝonge men dighteþ ȝou ȝare 
For whan þe Iustice sitt we moote be þare 
For I am vnder borwe til þat I come 
And my broþer for me to prisoun schal be nome 
By seint Iame seyde his ȝonge men and þou rede þerto
Ordeyne how it schal be and it schal be do 
whil Gamelyn was comyng þer þe Iustice sat
The fals knight his broþer forȝat he nat þat  
To huyre þe men on his quest to hangen his broþer
Though he hadde nought þat oon he wolde haue þat oþer
Tho cam Gamelyn fro vnder woode Rys
And broughte wiþ him  his ȝonge men of prys
 I se wel seyde Gamelyn þe Iustice is sette
Go aforn adam and loke how it spette 
Adam went in to þe halle and loked al aboute
he seyh þere stonde lordes gret and stoute 
And sir Ote his broþer fetered wel fast
Þo went adam out of halle as he were agast
Adam said to Gamelyn and to his felaws alle
Sir Ote stant Ifetered in þe moot halle


Ȝonge men seide Gamelyn þis ȝe heeren alle
Sir Ote stant Ifetered in þe moot halle
If God ȝif vs grace wel for to doo
he schal it abegge þat broughte þertoo
Thanne sayde adam þat lokkes hadde hore 
Cristes curs most he haue þat him bond so sore
And þou wilt Gamelyn do after my red
Ther is noon in þe halle schal bere awey his heed
Adam seyde Gamelyn we wilne nought don so 
we wil slee þe giltyf and lat þe oþer go
I wil in to þe halle and wiþ þe Iustice speke 
On hem þat ben gultyf I wil ben awreke
lat non skape at þe dore take ȝonge men ȝeme 
For I wil be Iustice þis day domes to deme
God spede me þis day at my newe werk
Adam com on with me  for þou schalt be my clerk
His men answereden him and bad him doon his best
And if þou to vs haue neede þou schalt fynde vs prest
we wiln stande with þe whil þat we may dure
And but we werke manly pay vs non hure 
yonge men seyde Gamelyn so mot I wel þe
As trusty a maister ȝe schal fynde of me 
Right þere þe justice sat in þe halle
In wente Gamelyn amonges hem alle
 Gamelyn leet vnfetere his broþer out of beende
Thanne seyde sir Ote his broþer þat was heende  
Thou haddest almost Gamelyn dwelled to longe
For þe quest is oute on me þat I schulde honge
Broþer seyde Gamelyn so god ȝif me good rest
This day þey schuln ben hanged þat ben on þy quest
And þe Iustice boþe þat is Iugges man
And þe scherreue boþe þurgh him it bigan
Than seyde Gamelyn to þe Iustise
Now is þy power ydon þou most nedes arise
Thow hast ȝeuen domes þat ben yuel dight
I wil sitten in þy sete an dressen hem aright


The Iustice sat stille and roos nought anoon
And Gamelyn cleuede his cheeke boon
Gamelyn took him in his arm and no more spak
But þrew him ouer þe barre and his arm tobrak
Durste non to Gamelyn seye but good
For fered of þe company þat wiþoute stood
Gamelyn sette him doun in þe Iustices sete 
And sire Ote his broþer by him  and adam at his feet
whan Gamelyn was Iset in þe Iustices sete
herkneþ of a bourde þat Gamelyn dede 
he leet fetre þe Iustice and his fals broþer
And dede hem come to þe barre þat oon wiþ þat oþer
Tho Gamelyn hadde þus ydoon had he no rest
Til he had enquered who was on þe quest
For to deme his broþer sir Ote for to honge 
Er he wiste which þey were he þoughte ful longe
But as sone as Gamelyn wiste wher þey were
he dede hem euerichone fetere in feere 
And bringen hem to þe barre and sette hem in rewe 
By my faiþ seyde þe Iustice þe Scherreue is a schrewe
Than seyde Gamelyn to þe Iustise
Thou hast yȝeue domes of þe wors assise
And þe xij sisours þat weren of þe queste 
They schul ben hanged þis day so haue I reste
Thanne seide þe scherreue to ȝonge Gamelyn ·
Lord I crie þe mercy broþer art þou myn
Therfore seyde Gamely haue þou cristes curs
For and þou were maister ȝit I schulde haue wors  
For to make schort tale and nouȝt to tarie longe
he ordeyned him a queste of his men so stronge
The Iustice and þe scherreue boþe honged hye
To weyuen wiþ ropes and wiþ þe wynd drye
And þe xij sisours sorwe haue þat rekke
Alle þey were hanged faste by þe nekke 
Thus ended þe fals knight wiþ his treccherie
That euer had Ilad his lyf in falsnes and folye


He was hanged by þe nek and nouȝt by þe purs
That was þe meede þat he had for his fadres curs
Sir Ote was eldest and Gamelyn was ȝing
þey wenten wiþ here freendes euen to þe kyng
They made pees wiþ þe kyng of þe best assise
The kyng loued wel sir Ote and made him Iustise
And after þe kyng made Gamelyn boþe in Est and west
Chef Iustice of al his fre forest
Alle his wighte ȝonge men þe kyng forȝaf here gilt
And sitthen in good office þe kyng hem hath Ipilt
Thus wan Gamelyn his lond and his leede
And wrak him of his enemys and quyt hem here meede
And sire Ote his broþer made him his heir
And siþþen wedded Gamelyn a wyf boþe good and feyr
They lyueden togidere  whil þat crist wolde
And siþen was Gamelyn grauen vnder molde
And so schal we alle may þer no man fle
God bryng vs to þe Ioye þat euer schal be  AMEN
Owre Hoste sawh þat þe brighte sonne

IN Surrie dwelled whilom a companye  
Of Chapmen riche and þerto sad and trewe

Fro day to day as I schal ȝou deuyse 
This was þe comyn voys of euery man
Oure emperour of Rome god him see
A doughter haþ þat siþ þe world bygan
To Rekne as wel hir goodnes as hir bewte 
Nas neuer such anoþer as was sche
I prey to god hir saue and susteene
And wolde sche were of al Europe þe queene
  
In hire is hye bewte wiþoute pryde
Ȝowþe wiþoute grefhed or folye
To alle here werkes vertu is hire gyde 
humblesse haþ slayne in hir tyrrannye 
Sche is myrour of alle curtesye 
hir herte is verrey chambre of holynesse
hir hond mynistre of fredom and almesse
And al þis voys is soþ as god is trewe
But now to purpos let vs turne aȝein
These marchantȝ haue don fraught here schippes newe 
And whan þey haue þis blisful mayde seyn ·
Home to Surrey be þey went aȝein 
And doon here needes as þey haue don ȝore
And lyuen in wele I can ȝou say no more 
Now fel it þat þese marchauntȝ stooden in grace 
Of him þat was þe Sowdan of Surrye
For whan þey come fro eny straunge place 
he wolde of his benigne curtesye
Make hem good chere and busily aspye
Tydynges of sondry regnes for to lere
The wordes þat þey mighte seen and heere 
Among oþer þinges specially
These marchauntȝ him told of dame Constaunce
So gret noblesse in ernest so ryally
That þis Sowdan haþ caught so gret plesaunce
To haue hir figure in his remembraunce
And al his lust and al his besy cure
was for to loue hir whiles his lyf may dure
Par auenture in þilke large booke 
which þat is cleped þe heuen Iwrite was  
wiþ sterres whan þat he his burþe took
That he for loue schulde haue his deþ allas 
  
For in þe sterres clerere þen is glas 
Is wryten god woot whoso cowþe it rede
The deþ of euery man wiþouten drede
IN sterres many a wynter þer byfore
was write þe deþ of Ector and Achilles 
Of Pompe Iulius er þey were Ibore 
The stryf of Thebes and of Ercules 
Of Sampson Turnus and of Socrates
The deþ but mennes wittes ben so dulle 
That no wight can wel rede it at þe fulle
This sowdan for his pryue counseil sent
And schortly of þis mater for to pace 
he haþ to hem declared his entent
And seyd hem certeyn but he might haue grace 
To haue Constance wiþinne a litel space
he nas but deed and charged hem in hyȝe
To schapen for his lyf som remedye
Dyuerse men dyuers þinges seyde
The argumentes casten vp and doun
Many a subtyl resoun forþ þey leyden
They spekyn of magike and of ambusioun
But finally as in conclusioun
They can nought seen in þat non auauntage
Ne in non oþer wey saue in mariage
Than sawgh þey þer in such difficulte
By wey of resoun to speke it al playn ·
By cause þat þer was such dyuersite 
Bitwen here boþe lawes as þey sayn
They trowe þat no cristen prince wold fayn
wedden his child vnder our lawe swete 
That vs was taught by mahoun oure prophete 
  
And he answerde raþer þan I lese
Constance I wol be cristen douteles 
I moot be heres I may non oþer cheese 
I pray ȝou haldeth ȝour arguments in pees 
Saueþ my lyf and beþ nat recheles   
Goþ geteþ hire þat haþ my lyf in cure 
For in þis wo I may no lenger dure 
What needeþ gretter dilatacioun
I say by tretys and ambassatrye
And by þe popes mediacioun
And al þe chirche and al þe chyualrye 
That in destruccioun of mawmetrye
And in encresse of cristes lawe deere 
They ben acordid as ȝe schal after heere
How þat þe Soudan and his baronage
And alle his lieges schuld Icrystned be 
And he schal haue Constance in mariage
And certeyn gold I not what quantite
And þerfore founden þey suffisant seurte
This same acord was sworn on euery syde
Now fair Constance almighty god þe guyde 
Now wolde som men wayten as I gesse
That I schulde tellen al þe puruyaunce 
That þemperour of his gret noblesse 
Haþ schapen for his doughter dame Constaunce 
wel may men knowe þat so gret ordynaunce
May no man telle in so litel a clause 
As was arrayed for so high a cause 
Bisschops ben schapen with hir for to wende
lordes ladyes and knightes of renoun
And oþer folk ynowe þis þis is þe ende
And notefied is þurgh out þe toun
  
That euery wight wiþ gret deuocioun
Schulde preye crist þat he þis mariage
Receyue in gree and spede þis viage
The day is come of hire departyng
I say þe woful day þat þan is come
That þer may be no lenger tarryyng
But forþeward þey dresse hem alle and some 
Constance þat with sorwe is ouercome
Ful pale arist and dresseþ hir to wende 
For wel sche saugh þer nas non oþer ende
Allas what wonder is it þough sche wepte  
That schal be sent to straunge nacioun
Fro freendes þat so tenderly hir kepte 
And to be bounde vndur subieccioun
Of oon sche knew nat his condicioun
Housbondes ben al goode and han be ȝore
That knowen wyfes I dar say no more 
Fader sche seid þy wrecched child Costaunce
Thy ȝonge doughter fostred vp so softe 
And ȝe my mooder my souerayn plesaunce
Ouer al þing outaken crist on lofte 
Constaunce ȝour child hir recomaundeth ofte
Vnto ȝour grace  for I schal in to Surrye
Ne schal I neuer see ȝou more wiþ ye
Allas vnto þe barbre nacioun
I most anoon  seþens it is ȝour wille
But crist þat starf for our redempcioun
So ȝeue me grace his hestes to fulfille 
I wrecched womman no fors þey I spille 
wommen ben born to þraldam and penaunce
And to ben vnder mannes gouernaunce
  
I trowe at Troye whan Pirrus brak þe wal
Or yleon þat brend Thebes þe Citee
Ne at Rome for þe harme þurgh hanibal
That Romayns han venquysshed tymes þre
Nas herd such tender wepyng for pite
As in þe Chambur was for hir partyng
But forþ sche moot wheþer sche weep or syng
O firste meuyng cruel firmament
with þi diurnal swough þat crowdest ay
And hurlest al fro Est to Occident
That naturelly wold hold anoþer way
Thyn crowdyng sette þe heuen in such array
At þe bygynnyng of þis fiers viage
That cruel marcȝ haþ slayn þis marriage
Infortunat ascendent tortuous
Of which þe lordes helples falle allas
Out of his angle in to þe derkest hous
O  Mariȝ atteȝere as in þis caas  
O feble moone vnhappy been þi paas 
Thou knettest þe þer þou art nat receyued
Ther þou were wel fro þennes artow weyued
Inprudent Emperour of Rome allas
was þer no philosopher in al þy toun
Is no tyme bet þan oþer in such caas
Of viage is þer noon eleccioun
Namly to folk of heigh condicioun
Nought whan a roote is of a birthe Iknowe
Allas we ben to lewed and eek to slowe 
 is brought þis woful faire mayde 
Solempnely with euery circumstaunce 
Now Ihū crist so be wiþ ȝou sche sayde 
Ther nys nomor but far wel fair Custaunce
  
She peyneth hire to make good contienaunce
And forþ I lete hire sayle in þis manere 
And torne I wol aȝein to my matiere 
The moder of þe Sawdan ful of vices
Aspyed haþ hir sones playn entent
how he wol lete his olde sacrifices
And right anoon sche for hir counseil sent
And þey ben come to knowe what sche ment
And whan assembled was þis folk in fere
Sche sette hir doun and sayd as ȝe schal heere 
Lordes quod sche ȝe knowen euerichon
how þat my sone in poynt is for to lete
The holy lawes of our alkaron
Ȝe ben goddes messangere makamete 
But oon avow to grete god I hete
The lyf schuld raþer out of my body stert
Or makametes law go out of myn hert
What schal vs tyden of þis newe lawe
But þraldam to oure body and penaunce
And afterward in helle to be drawe 
For we reneyed mahound oure creaunce
But lordes wol ȝe maken assuraunce
As I schal say assentyng to my lore
And I schal make vs sauf for euermore  
They sworen and assenten euery man
To lyf wiþ hir and dye and by hir stonde
And euerich in þe beste wise he can
To strengþen hir schal al his frendes fonde
And sche haþ Emperise take on honde
which ȝe schul heere þat I schal deuyse 
And to hem alle sche spak in þis wyse 
  
We schul first feyne ous cristendom to take
Cold watir schal nat greue vs but a lite 
And I schal such a fest and Reuel make 
That as I trow I schal þe Sowdan quyte
For þough his wyf be cristned neuer so white
Sche schal haue need to waissche away þe rede
They sche a font of watir wiþ hir lede
O Sowdones root of iniquite
Virago þou Semyram þe secounde
O serpent vnder feminite
Lyk to þe serpent deep in helle Ibounde
O feyned womman alle þat may confounde
Vertu and Innocence þurgh þy malice 
Is bred in þe as nest of euery vice
O Satan enuyous syn þilke day
That þou were chased fro oure heritage
wel knewest þou to wommen þe olde way
Thou madest Eue to bryng vs in seruage
Thou wolt fordoon þis cristen mariage
Thyn instrument so weylaway þe while
Makestow of wommen whan þou wolt bygile
This Sawdones whom I þus blame and wary
let pryuely hir counseil gon his way
what schuld I in þis tale lenger tary
Sche rideþ to þe Soudan on a day
And seyd him þat sche wold reney hir lay
And cristendam of prestes handes fonge
Repentyng hir sche hethen was so longe
Bysechyng him to doon hir þat honour
That sche most haue þe cristen men to feste 
To plesen hem I wil do my labour  
The sawdan seith I wol do at ȝour heste
  
And knelyng þankeþ hir of þat requeste
So glad he was he nyst nat what to seye
Sche kyst hir sone and hom sche goþ hir weye
Arryued ben þe cristen folk to londe 
In Surry with a gret solempne route
And hastily þis soudan sent his sonde
First to his moder and al þe regne aboute
And seyd his wyf was comen out of doute
And preyeþ hir for to ride aȝein þe queene
The honour of his regne to susteene 
Gret was þe prees and riche was tharray
Of Surriens and Romayns mette in feere
The moodur of þe Sowdan riche and gay
Receyued hir with al so glad a cheere
As eny modir might hir doughter deere
And to þe nexte Citee þer bysyde
A softe paas solempnely þay ryde
Nought trow I þe triumphe of Iulius
Of which þat lukan makeþ moche bost
was ryaller ne more curious
Than was thassemble of þis blisful oost
But þis Scorpioun þis wikked goost
This Sowdones for al hir flateryng
Cast vnder þis ful mortally to styng
The Sawdan comþ himself sone after þis
So really þat wonder is to telle
And welcomeþ hir wiþ ioy and blys
And þus with myrth and ioy I let hem dwelle
  
The fruyt of þis matier is þat I telle
whan tyme com men þought it for þe best
That reuel stynt and men goon to her rest
The tyme com þe olde Sowdonesse
Ordeyned haþ þis fest of which I told
And to þe feste cristen folk hem dresse
    
Ther men may fest and realte byholde
And deyntes mo  þan I can of deuyse
But al to deere þey bought it ar þey ryse  
O sodeyn wo þat euer art successour
 To worldly blis spreynd is wiþ bitternesse 
The ende of oure ioye of oure worldly labour
wo occupieth þe fyn of oure gladnesse
herken þis counseil for thyn sikernesse
vpon þyn glade dayes haue in þi mynde
The vnwar woo þat cometh ay bihynde
For schortly for to tellen at o word
The Sawdan and þe cristen euerichone
Ben al tohewe and stiked atte bord
But it were Dame Constaunce allone
This olde Sowdones þis cursed crone
haþ wiþ hir frendes doon þis cursed dede
For sche hir self wold al þe contre lede
Ne þer was surrien noon  þat was conuerted
That of þe counseil of þe Sawdon woot
That he nas altohewe or he asterted
And Constaunce haue þey take anon foothoot
And in a schippe  steleres god it woot
They haue hir set and bad hir lerne to sayle
Out of Surry aȝeinward to ytaile
  
A certein tresour þat sche þider ladde
And soþ to sayn vitaile gret plente
They haue hir ȝeuen and cloþes eek sche hadde
And forþ sche sayleþ to þe salte see
O my Constaunce ful of benignite
O Emperoures ȝonge doughter deere
he þat is Lord of fortun be þi steere
Sche blesseþ hir and with ful pitous voys
Vnto þe croys of crist þan seyde sche
O cler o welful auter holy croys
Rood of þe lambes blood ful of pite
That wissh þe world fro old iniquite
Me fro þe feend and fro his clowes keepe
That day þat I schal drenchen in þe deepe
Victorious tre proteccioun of trewe
That oonly were worthy for to bere
That kyng of heuen with his woundes newe  
The white lamb þat hurt was with a spere
Flemer of feendes out of him and here 
On which þy lymes feithfully extenden
Me kepe and ȝif me might my lyf to menden
Ȝeres and dayes flette þis creature
Thurghout þe see of Grece in to þe strayte
Of Marrok as it was hir aduenture 
O many a sory mele may sche bayte
After hir deth ful  ofte may sche wayte
Or þat þe wilde wawe wol hir dryue
Vnto þe place þer as sche schal arryue
Men mighten aske why sche was nouȝt slayn
Ek at þe fest who might hir body saue
And I answered that demaunde agayn
who saued Daniel  in thorrible Caue
  
That euery wight sauf he mayster or knaue
was wiþ þe lioun frete or he asterte
No wight but god þat he bar in his herte
God lust to schewe his wondurful miracle
In hir for sche schuld seen his mighty werkes
Crist which þat is to euery harm triacle
By certeyn menes ofte as knowen clerkes
Doth þing for certeyn ende þat ful derk is 
To mannes witt  þat for our ignoraunce
Ne can nought knowe his prudent puruyaunce
Now sith sche was nat at þe fest Islawe 
who kepte hir fro drenching in þe see 
who kepte Ionas in þe fisches mawe
Til he was spouted vp at Niniue
wel may men knowe it was no wight but he
That kept þe pepul Ebrayk fro her drenchyng
wiþ drye feet  þurghout þe see passyng
Who hadde foure spiritȝ of tempest
That power han to noyen land and see
Boþe norþ and souþ and also west and Est
Anoyeþ neyþer londe  see ne tree 
Soþly þe comaunder of þat was he
That fro þe tempest ay þis womman kepte  
As wel when sche awok as when sche slepte
Wher might þis womman mete and drinke haue 
Thre ȝer and more  how lasteþ hir vitaille
who fedde þe Egipcien marie in þe Caue
Or in desert no wight but crist saunȝ faile
Fyf þousand folk  it was a gret meruaile
wiþ loues fyf and fissches tuo to feede
God sent his foysoun at her grete neede
  
Sche dryueþ forþ in to oure Occean
Thurghout oure wilde see til atte last
vnder an holte þat men nempne can
Fer in Northumberland þe wawe hir cast
And in þe sand þe schip styked so fast
That þennes wold it nouȝt in al a tyde
The wille of crist was þat sche schold abyde
The Constabil of  þe castel doun is fare 
To se þis wrak  and al þe schip he sought
And fond þis wery womman ful of care
And fand also þe tresour þat sche brought
In hir langage mercy sche bisought
The lif out of her body for to wynne
hir to delyuer of woo þat sche was Inne 
A maner latyn corupt was hir speche
But algates  þer by sche was vnderstonde
The constabil whan him lust no lenger seche
This woful womman broughte he to londe 
Sche kneleþ doun and thanketh goddes sonde
But what sche was sche wolde no man seye
For foul ne faire  þough sche scholde deye
Sche was sche seyd so mased in þe see
That sche forgat hir mynde by hire trowþe 
The constable had of hir so gret pitee
And eek his wyf þey wepeden for routhe
Sche was so diligent wiþouten slouþe 
To serue and plese euer in þat place
That alle hir louen þat loken on hir face
The Constable and dame hermegyld his wyf
To telle ȝou playne in peynes boþe were  
But hermegyld loued constance as hir lyf
And Constance haþ so long herberwed þere
  
In orisoun wiþ many a bitter teere 
Til ihū haþ conuerted þurgh his grace
Dame hermegyld þe Constables wif of þe place
In al þe lond no cristen men durst route
Al cristen men ben fled from þat contre
Thurgh payens þat conquered al aboute 
The places of þe north by land and see
To wales fled þe cristianite
Of olde britouns dwellyng in þis yle 
Ther was hir refut for þe mene while
But ȝit nere cristen britouns so exiled
That þer  nere some in here pryuite 
honoured crist and heþen men bygiled
And neigh þe Castel such þer dwellid þre
That oon of hem was blynd and might nat se 
But if it were wiþ eyen of his mynde
wiþ which men seen after þat þey ben blynde
Bright was þe sonne as in someres day
For which þe constable and his wif also
And Constaunce had take þe righte way
Toward þe see a forlong wey or two
To pleyen and to Romen to and fro
And in þat walk the blynde men þey mette
Croked and olde with eyen fast yschette
In name of crist  cryed þis old britoun
Dame hermegyld ȝif me my sight aȝeyn
This lady wax affrayed of þe soun
lest þat hir houseband schortly to sayn
wold hir for ihū cristes loue haue slayn
Til Constaunce made hir bold and bad hir werche
The wil of crist as douȝter of holy chirche
  
The Constable wax abaisshed of þat sight
And sayde what amounteþ al þis fare
Constaunce answered  sir it is cristes might
That helpeth folk out of þe feendes snare 
And so ferforþ sche gan hir lay declare  
That sche þe Constable er þat it was Eue
Conuerted and on crist made him bileue
This Constable was no þing lord of þe place
Of which I speke þer he Constance fond
But kept it strongly many a wynter space
vnder alla kyng of Northumberlond
That was ful wys and worþy of his hond
Aȝein þe scottes as men may wel heere
But tourne aȝein I wil to my mateere
Satan þat euer vs wayteþ to begile 
Sawe of Constaunce þe persecucioun
And cast anoon how he might quyt hir while 
And made a ȝong knight þat dwelt in þe toun
Loue hir so hoot of foul affeccioun
That verrayly him þouȝt he schulde spille
But he of hire  oones had his wille
He wowith hir but it avayleþ nought
Sche wolde do no synne by no weye
And for despyt  he compassed in his þought
To maken hir a schamful deþ to deye
he wayteth whan þe Constable was aweye
And pryuyly vpon a nyght he crepte
In hermyngyldes chambre whil sche slepte 
Wery forwaked in here Orisoun
Slepeþ Constaunce and hermyngyld also
This knight þurgh Satanas temptacioun
Al softely is to þe bed ygo
  
And kutte þe þrote of hermegild a two 
And leyd þe bloody knyf by dame Constaunce
And went his way þat god ȝeue him meschaunce
Sone after comþ þis Constable hom agayn
And eek alla þat was kyng of þat lond
And say his wyf dispitously Islayn
For which ful oft  he wept and wrong his hond
And in þe bed þe blody knyf he fond
By Dame Custaunce allas what might he say
For verray woo  hir witt was al away
To king Alla was told al þis meschaunce  
And eekþe tyme and wher and eek þe wyse
That in a schip was founden þis Constaunce
As here bifore ȝe haue herd me deuyse 
The kinges hert of pite gan agrise
whan he saugh so benigne a creature
Falle in disese and in mysauenture
For as þe lomb toward his deþ is brought 
So stant þis Innocent bifore þe kyng
This false knight þat haþ þis tresoun wrought
Bereþ hir an hand þat sche hath don þis þing
But neuer þe les þer was gret mornyng
Among þe people and seyn þey can not gesse
That sche had doon so gret a wikkednesse
For þey han seyen hir so vertuous
And louyng hermegyld right as hir lyf
Of þis bar witnesse euerich in þat hous
Saue he þat slowȝ hermegyld with his knyf
This gentil kyng haþ caught a gret motyf
Of his witnesse and þought he wold enquere
Deppere in þis cas a trouþe to lere
  
Allas Constaunce þou ne has no champioun
Ne fighte canstow nat so welaway
But he þat for oure redempcioun
Bonde Sathan and ȝit liþ þer he lay
So be þy stronge champioun þis day
For but crist vpon þe miracle kythe
withouten gilt þou schalt be slayn as swithe
Sche set hir doun on knees and þan sche sayde
Immortal god þat sauedest Susanne
For false blame and þou mercyful mayde
Mary I mene doughter of seint Anne
Bifore whos child aungeles syng Osanne
If I be gultles of þis felonye
My socour be for elles schal I dye
Haue ȝe not seye somtyme a pale face
Among a prees of him þat haþ be lad
Toward his deþ wher him geyneþ no grace 
And such a colour in his face haþ had  
Men mighte knowe his face was so bystad
Among alle þe faces in þat route
So stant Constance and lokeþ hire aboute 
O queenes lyuyng in prosperite
Duchesses and ȝe ladies euerychon
haueþ som reuþe on hir aduersite
An emperoures doughter stond allon
Sche nath no wight to whom to make hir moon
O blod ryal þat stondest in þis drede 
Ferre be þy frendes at þy grete neede 
This Alla kyng haþ such compassioun
As gentil hert is fulfild of pite
That from his eyen ran þe water doun
Now hastily do fech a book quod he 
  
And if þis knight wil swere how þat sche 
This womman slowȝ ȝet wol we us avyse
whom þat we wille schal be oure iustise
A britoun book Iwrite wiþ euaungiles
was fette and on þis book he swor anoon
Sche gultif was and in þe mene whiles
An hond him smot vpon þe nekke boon
That doun he fel anon right at a stoon
And boþe his yen brast out of his face
In sight of euery body in þat place
A vois was herd in general audience
And seist þou hast disclaundred gulteles
The doughter of holy chirche in hire presence
Thus hastow doon and ȝit I holde my pees
Of þis meruaile agast was al þe prees
As mased folk þey stooden euerychon
For drede of wreche saue Custaunce allon
Gret was þe drede and eek þe repentaunce
Of hem þat hadden gret suspeccioun
vpon þe sely Innocent Custaunce
And for þis miracle in conclusioun
And by Custaunces mediacioun
The kyng and many oþer in þe place
Conuerted was  thanked be cristes grace  
This false knight was slayn for his vntrouþe 
By Iuggement of Alla hastyly
And ȝit Custaunce haþ of his deþ gret rouþe
And after þis ihus of his mercy
Made alla wedde ful solempnely
This holy mayde þat is bright and schene 
And þus haþ crist Imaad Constance a queene
  
But who was woful if I schal not lye 
Of þis weddyng but Domegild and þo
The kynges mooder ful of tyrannye
hir þought hir cursed herte brast atwo
Sche wolde nat hir sone had Ido so
hir þought despyte  þat he schulde take
So straunge a creature vnto his make
Me lust not of þe caf ne of þe stree
Make so long a tale as of þe corn
what schuld I telle of þe realte
Of mariage  or which cours goþ biforn
who bloweth in a trompe or in an horn
The fruyt of euery tale is for to seye
They ete and drynk  and daunce  and synge and pleye
They gon to bed as it was skile and right
For þough þat wyfes ben ful holy þinges
They moste take in pacience a night
Such maner necessaries as ben plesynges
To folk that han Iwedded hem wiþ rynges
And haluendel her holynesse ley a side
And for þe tyme it may non oþer betyde
On hire he gat a knaue child anoon
And to a bisschope and a Constable eeke
he took his wyf to kepe whan he is goon
To scotlondward his foomen for to seeke
Now faire Custaunce þat is so humble and meeke
So long is goon wiþ childe til þat stille
Sche held hir chambre abidyng goddes wille
The tyme is come a knaue child sche bere
Maurius atte funstone men him calle
This Constabil doþ come forþ a messager  
And wrot to his kyng þat cleped was Alle
  
how þat þis blisful tydyng is bifalle
And oþer þinges spedful for to seye
he takeþ þe lettre and forþ he goþ his weye
This messanger to doon his auauntage
vnto þe kynges moder he goþ ful swiþe
And salueth hire  fair in his langage
Ma dame quod he ȝe may be glad and bliþe
And þanke god an hundred þousand siþe
My lady queen haþ child wiþouten doute
To ioye and blis of al þe reame aboute
Lo heer þe lettres sealed of þis þing
That I mot bere with al þe hast I may
If ȝe wole ought vnto ȝoure sone þe kyng
I am ȝoure seruaunt boþe night and day
Doungyld answerde as now þis tyme nay
But here al nyght I wol þou take þy rest
To morwen I wil say þe what me lest
This messanger drank sadly ale and wyn
And stolen were his lettres pryuely
Out of his box whil he sleep as a swyn
And countrefeet þey were subtily
Anoþer sche him wroot ful synfully
vnto þe kyng direct of þis matiere
Fro his Constable as ȝe schul after heere
The lettre spak þe queen delyuered was
Of so orryble and feendly creature
That in þe castel noon so hardy was
That eny while dorste þerin endure 
The mooder was an Elf by auenture
Bycome by charmes or by sorcerie
And euery man hatiþ hir companyne
  
Wo was þis kyng whan he þis letter had sein
But to no wight he told his sorwes sore
But of his owen hand he wrot agayn
welcome þe sond of crist for eueremore
To me þat am now lerned in his lore
lord welcome be þy lust and þy pleasaunce  
My lust I putte al in þyn ordinaunce
Kepeth þis child al be it foul or fair
And eek my wyf vnto myn hom comyng
Crist whan him lust may sende me an hair
More agreable þan þis to my likyng
The lettre he seleth pryuyly wepyng
which to þe messager he took ful sone
And forþ he goth þer nys no more to done
O messager fulfild of dronkenesse
Strong is þy breþ þy lymes faltren ay
And þou bywreyest alle sykernesse
Thy mynde is lorn þou ianglest as a Iay
Thy face is torned al in a newe array
Ther drunkenesse regneþ in eny route
Ther is no counseil hid wiþouten doute
O Domegyld I haue non englisch digne
vnto þy malice and þy tyrannye
And þerfor to þe feend I þe resigne
let him endyten of þi treccherie
Fy mannyssch fy o nay by god I lye
Fy feendly spirit for I dar wel telle
Though þou here walke þy spirit is in helle
This messanger comþ fro þe kyng agayn
And at þe kinges modres court he light
And sche was of þis messenger ful fayn
And pleseþ him in al þat euer sche might
  
he drank and wel his gurdel vnderpight
he slepeþ and he fareþ in his gyse
Al nyght vnto þe sonne gan arise
Eft were his lettres stolen euerichon
And countrefeted lettres in þis wise
The kyng comaundeþ his constable anon
vp peyne of hangyng of an heiȝ Iustise
That he schulde suffre in no maner wyse
Constaunce in his regne for to abyde
Thre dayes and a quarter of a tyde
But in þe same schip as he hir fond
hire and hir ȝonge sone and al hire gere  
he schulde putte and crowde fro þe londe
And charge hire þat sche neuer eft come þere
·O my Constaunce wel may þy goost haue fere
And slepyng in þy drem ben in penaunce
whan Domegyl cast al þis ordynaunce 
This messanger amorwe whan he awook
vnto þe castel held þe nexte way
And to þe constable he þe lettre took
And whan þat he þe pitous lettre say
Ful ofte he seyd allas and welaway
Lord crist quod he how may þis world endure
So ful of synne is many a creature
O mighty god if þat it be þy wille
Seþ þou art rightful iugge how may þis be 
That þou wolt suffre Innocentȝ to spille 
And wikked folk regne in prosperite
·O good Constance allas so wo is me
That I moot be þy tormentour or deye
On schamful deþ þer is non oþer weye
  
Wepyng boþe ȝong and olde in al þat place
whan þat þe kyng þis corsed lettre sent
And Constance with a dedly pale face
The fayre day toward hir schip sche went
But neuerþeles sche takeþ in good entent
The wil of crist  and knelyng on þe grounde
Sche sayde lord ay welcome be þy sonde
He þat me kepte fro þe false blame
whil I was on þe lond amonges ȝou
He can me kepe from harm and eek fro schame
In þe see al þough I se nat how
As strong as euer he was he is right now
In him trust I and in his mooder deere
That is to me my sayl and eek my steere 
Hir litel child lay wepyng in hir arm
And knelyng pitously to him sche sayde 
Pees litle sone I wol do þe noon harm
wiþ þat hir kerchef of hir hed sche brayde
And ouer his litel yȝen sche it layde  
And in hir arm sche lullith it wel faste
And vnto heuen hir eyȝen vp sche caste
Moder quod sche and mayde bright marie
Soþ is þat þurgh wommannes eggement
Mankynde was lorn and dampned ay to dye
For which þy child was on a cros torent
Thyn blisful eyȝen sawh al þis torment
Then nys þer noon comparisoun bitwene
Thy wo and any woo may nat sustene
Thow saugh þy child Islaw byfor þyn yen
And ȝit now lyueþ my litel child par fay
Now lady bright to whom alle woful cryen
Thou glory of wommanhod þou faire may
  
Thou heuen of refute brighte sterre of day
Rewe on my child þat of þyn gentilnesse 
Rewest on euery synful in destresse
O litel child allas what is þi gilt
That neuer wroughtest synne as ȝet par de
why wil þyn harde fader han þe spilt
O mercy deere and Constable seyde sche
And let my litel child here dwelle with þe
And if þou darst not sauen him for blame 
So kys him oones in his fadres name
Ther wiþ sche loked bakward to þe lond
And seyde far wel housbond rewþeles
And vp sche rist and walkeþ doun þe stronde
Toward þe schip hir folweþ al þe prees
And euer sche preyeþ hir child to hold his pees
And took hir leue and wiþ an holy entent
Sche blesseþ hire and to þe schip sche went
Vytailled was þe schip it is no drede
Abundauntly for hire ful longe space
And oþer necessaries þat schulde nede
Sche had ynowȝ heryed be cristeȝ grace
For wynd and water almighty god purchace
And bryng hir hom I can no bettre say
But in þe see sche dryueþ forþ hir way
Alla þe kyng comþ hom soon after þis  
vnto þe Castel of þe which I tolde
And askeþ wher his wyf and his child ys
The Constable gan aboute his herte colde
  
And playnly al þe maner he him tolde
As ȝe han herd  I can telle it no better
And schewed þe kynges seal and his letter
And seyde lord as ȝe comaunded me
vp peyne of deþ so haue I do certayn
This messager tormented was til he
Moste biknowe and telle it plat and playn ·
Fro nyght to night in what place he had layn ·
And þus by witt and subtil enqueryng
ymagined was by wham þis gan to spryng
The hand was knowen þat þe lettre wroot
And al þe venym of þis cursed dede
But in what wyse certeynly I noot
Theffect is þis þat alla out of drede
his moder slough as men may pleynly reede 
For þat sche traytour was to hir ligeaunce
Thus endeþ olde Domegild wiþ meschaunce
The sorwe þat þis alla night and day
Makþ for his wyf and for his child also
Ther is no tonge þat it telle may
But now I wol vnto Custaunce go
That fleetetþ in þe see in peyne and wo
V ȝeer and more as likeþ cristes sonde
Er þat hir schip approched vnto londe
Vnder an hethen castel atte last
Of which þe name in my text nouȝt I fynde
Constaunce and eek hir child þe see vpcast
Almighty god þat saueth al mankynde 
Haue on Constaunce and on hir child som mynde
That fallen is in hethen hond eft sone
In poynt to spille as I schal telle ȝou soone
  
Doun fro þe Castel comþ þer many a wight
To gawren on þis schip and on Constaunce
But schortly fro þe castel on a night
The lordes styward God ȝiue him meschaunce  
A þeef þat had reneyed oure creaunce
Com in to schip alone and seyd he scholde
hir lemman be wheþir sche wold or nolde
Wo was þis wrecched womman þo bigoon
hire childe crieþ and sche pytously
But blisful mary hilp hir right anoon
For wiþ hir strengþe wel and mightily
The theef fel ouer boord al sodeinly
And in þe see he drenched for vengaunce
And þus haþ crist vnwemmed kept Constance
O foule lust O luxurie lo þin ende 
Nought oonly þat þou feyntest mannes mynde
But verrayly þou wolt his body schende
The ende of þyn werk or of þy lustes blynde
his compleynyng how many may men fynde
That nought for werk som tyme but for þentent
To doon his synne ben eyþer slayn or schent 
How may þis weyke womman han þe strengþe
hir to defende aȝein þe renegat
O Golias vnmesurable of lengþe
how mighte dauid make þe so mate
So ȝong and of armure so desolate
how dorst he loke vpon þyn dredful face
wel may men seyn it nas but goddes grace
Who ȝaf Iudith corage or hardynesse 
To slen him Olefernes in his tent
And to delyueren out þe wrecchednes
The peple of god I say in þis entent
  
That right as good spiryte vigor sent
To hem and saued hem out of meschaunce 
So sent he might and vigor to Constaunce
Forth goþ hir schip þurghout þe narwe mouth
Of Iubalter and Septe dryuyng ay
Somtyme west som tyme north and south
And somtyme Est ful many a wery way
Til cristes mooder blessed be sche ay
haþ schapen þurgh hir endeles goodnesse
To make an ende of hir heuynesse  
Now let vs stynt of Constance but a þrowe
And speke we of  þe Romayn Emperour
That out of Surrye haþ by lettres knowe
The slaughter of cristen folk and deshonour
Doon to his douȝter by a fals traytour
I mene þe cursed and wikked sowdenesse
That at þe fest leet slee boþe more and lesse
For which þis Emperour haþ sent anoon
his senatours with real ordynaunce
And oþer lordes got wot many oon
On surriens to take high vengaunce
They brenne  sleen  and bringen hem to meschaunce
Ful many a day but schortly þis is þende
homward to Rome þey schapen hem to wende
This Senatour repayreþ wiþ victorie
To Romeward saylyng ful really
And mette þe schip dryuyng as seiþ þe story
In which Constance sitteþ ful pitously
No þing ne knew he what sche was ne why
Sche was in such aray  sche nolde seye
Of hire astaat al þough sche scholde deye
  
He bryngeþ hir to Rome and to his wyf
he ȝaf hir and hir ȝonge sone also
And wiþ þe Senatour lad sche hir lyf
Thus can our lady bryngen out of woo
woful Constance and many anoþer moo
And longe tyme dwelled sche in þat place
In holy werkes as euer was hir grace 
The Senatoures wif hir aunte was
But for al þat sche knew hir neuer more
I wol no lenger taryen in þis cas
But to kyng Alla which I spak of ȝore 
That for his wyf wepeþ and sikeþ sore 
I wol retorne  and lete I wol Constaunce
vnder þe Senatoures gouernaunce
Kyng alla which þat had his mooder slayn
vpon a day fel in such repentaunce 
That if I schortly telle schal and playn  
To Rome he comeþ to receyue his penaunce
And putte him in þe popes ordynaunce
In heigh and lowe and ihū crist bysought
Forȝef his wikked werkes þat he wrought
The fame anon þurgh Rome toun is born
how alla kyng schal come in pilgrymage
By herberiourȝ þat wenten him biforn
For which þe Senatour as was vsage
Rood him aȝein and many of his lynage
As wel to schewen his magnificence
As to doon eny kyng a reuerence
Gret cheere doþ þis noble Senatour
To kyng Alla and he to him also
Euerich of hem doþ oþer gret honour
And so bifel þat on a day or two
  
This Senatour is to kyng Alla go
To fest and schortly if I schal not lye
Constances sone  went in his companye
Som men wold seyn at request of Custaunce
This Senatour haþ lad þis child to feste
I may not telle euery circumstaunce
Be as be may þer was he atte leste
But soth it is right at his modres heste
Byforn hem alle duryng þe metes space
The child stood lokyng in þe kynges face
This alla kyng haþ of þe child gret wonder
And to þe Senatour he seyd anoon
whos is þat faire child þat stondeþ ȝonder
I not quod he by god and by seynt Ion
A moder he haþ but fader haþ he non
That I of woot and schortly in a stounde
he told Alla how þat þis child was founde 
But god woot quod þis senatour also
So vertuous a lyuer in my lyf
Ne saugh I neuer such as sche nomo
Of worldly womman mayden or of wyf
I dar wel say sche hadde leuer a knyf
Thurghout hir brest þan ben a womman wikke  
Ther is no man can bryng hir to þat prikke
Now was þis child as lik vnto Custaunce
As possible is a creature to be
This alla haþ þe face in remembraunce
Of Dame Custaunce and þer on mused he
If þat þe childes mooder were ought sche
That is his wyf and pryuely he hight
And sped him fro þe table þat he might
  
Par fay þought he fantom is in myn heed
I ought to deme of righful Iuggement
That in þe salte see my wyf is deed
And afterward he made þis argument
what woot I wher crist haþ hider sent
My wyf by see as wel as he hir sent
To my contre fro þennes þat sche went
And after noom home wiþ þe senatour
Goth alla for to see þis wonder chaunce
This Senatour doþ alla gret honour
And hastely he sent after Custaunce
But trusteþ wel hir luste nat to daunce 
whan þat sche wiste wherfore was þat sonde
vnnethes on hir feet sche mighte stonde 
Whan alla saugh his wyf fayre he hir grette
And wepte þat it was rewþe to se
For at þe firste look he on hir sette
he knew wel verrely þat it was sche
And for sorwe as domb sche stant as tre
So was hire herte schett in his distresse
whan sche remembred his vnkyndenesse
Twies sche swowned in his owen sight
he wept and him excuseþ pitously
Now god quod he and alle his halwes bright
So wisly on my soule haue mercy
That of ȝoure harm as gulteles am I
As is maurice my sone so lyk ȝoure face
Elles þe feend me fecche out of þis place 
Long was þe sobbyng and þe bitter peyne
Or þat here woful herte mighte cesse  
Gret was þe pite for to here hem pleyne
Thurgh whiche playntȝ gan here wo encresse
  
I pray ȝou alle my labour to relesse
I may not telle al here sorwe vnto morwe
I am so wery for to speke of þe sorwe 
But fynally whan þat the soþ is wist
That alla gilteles was of hir woo
I trowe an hundred tymes þey ben kist
And such a blys is þer bitwix hem tuo
That saue þe ioye þat lasteþ eueremo
Ther is noon lyk þat eny creature
haþ seyn or schal whil þat þe world may dure
Tho prayde sche hir housbond meekely
In þe relees of hir pytous pyne
The he wold preye hir fader specially
That of his maieste he wold enclyne
To vouche sauf som tyme with him to dyne
Sche preyeþ him eek he schulde by no weye
Vnto hir fader no word of hir seye
Som men wold seye þat hir child Maurice
Doþ his message vnto þe Emperour
But as I gesse alla was nat so nyce
To him þat is so souerayn of honour
As he þat is of cristes folk þe flour
Sent eny child but it is best to deeme
he went himsilf and so it may wel seme 
This Emperour haþ graunted gentilly
To come to dyner as he him bysought
As wel rede I he loked besily
vpon þe child and on his douȝter þought
Alla goþ to his In and as him ought
Arrayed for þis fest in euery wyse
As ferforth as his connyng may suffise
  
The morwe cam and alla gan him dresse
And eek his wyf þe Emperour for to meete
And for þey ryde in ioye and in gladnesse 
And whan sche saugh hir fader in þe streete
Sche light a doun and falleþ him to feete  
Fader quod sche ȝour ȝonge child Constance
Is now ful clene ou of ȝour remembraunce
I am ȝour doughter Custaunce quod sche
That whilom ȝe haue sent vnto Surrye
It am I fader þat in þe salte see
was put alloon and dampned for to dye
Now goode fader mercy I ȝou crye
Send me no more vnto noon hethenesse
But þanke my lord her of his kyndenesse
Who can þe pytous Ioye telle al
Bitwix hem þre siþ þey be þus Imette
But of my tale make an ende I schal
The day goþ fast I wol no lenger lette
This glade folk to dyner þey ben sette
In ioye and blys at mete I let hem dwelle
A þousand fold wel more þan I can telle
This child Maurice was siþþen Emperour
Imaad by þe pope and lyued cristenly
To cristes chirche dede he gret honour
But I let al his story passen by
Of Custaunce is my tale specially
In olde Romayn gestes men may fynde
Maurices lyf I bere it nought in mynde
This kyng alla whan he his tyme say
with his Constaunce his holy wyf so swete
To Engelond þey com þe righte way
wher as þey lyue in ioye and in quyete
  
But litel whil it last I ȝou biheete
Ioy of þis world  for tyme wol not abyde
Fro day to night it chaungeth as þe tyde
Who lyued euer in such delyt a day
That him ne meued eyþer his conscience
Of Ire or talent  or som maner affray
Enuy or pride or passioun or offence
I ne say but for þis ende þis sentence
But litel whil in ioye or in plesaunce
lasteþ þe blis  of alla with Custaunce
For deth þat takþ of heigh and low his rent  
whan passed was a ȝeere as I gesse 
Out of þis worlde  kyng alla he hent
For whom Custauns haþ ful gret heuynesse 
Now let vs pray þat god his soule blesse 
And dame Custaunce fynally to say
Toward þe toun of Rome goþ hir way
To Rome is come þis nobil creature
And fynt hir freendes þer boþe hool and sound
Now is sche skaped al hir auenture
And whanne sche hir fader had Ifounde
Doun on hir knees falleþ sche to grounde
wepyng for tendirnes in herte blithe
Sche heried god an hundred þousand sithe
In vertu and in holy almesdede
They lyuen alle and neuer a sondre wende
Til deþ departe hem þis lyf þey lede
And far now wel my tale is at an ende
Now ihū crist þat of his might may sende 
Ioy after wo gouerne vs in his grace 
And keep ous alle þat ben in þis place 
  
Our Ost vppon his styrops stood anoon·
And seyde good men herkneth euerychoon·
This was a þrifty tale for þe noones
Sir parissh prest quod he for goodes boones
Tel out a tale  as was þy forward ȝore
I see wel þat ȝe lered men in lore
Can moche good by goddes dignete
The parsoun him answerde ben dicite
what eyleþ þe man so synfully to swere
Our Ost answerd O Iankyn be ȝe þere
I smel a loller in þe wynd quod he
Now good men quod our Oste  herkneþ me


For we schul haue a predicacioun
This loller wolde prechen vs heer som what 
Nay by my fader soule þat schal he nat
Sayde the sompnour he schal heer nauȝt preche
he schal no gospel preche here ne teche  
we leuyn alle in þe grete god quod he
He wolde schewen som difficulte
Or springen cokkil in our clene corn
And þerfor ost I warne þe byforn
My ioly body schal a tale telle
Experiens þough noon auctorite
were in þis world it were ynough for me
To speke of wo þat is in mariage
For lordyngs syns I twelf ȝer was of age
I thank it god þat is eterne on lyue
housbondes atte chirch dore I haue had fyue
For I so ofte might haue weddid be
And alle were worþy men in here degre
But me was taught nought longe tyme goon is
That synnes crist went neuer but onys
To weddyng in þe Cane of Galile
That by þe same ensampul taught he me
That I ne weddid schulde be but ones
Herken such a scharp word for þe nones
Biside a welle Ihc god and man
Spak in reproef of þe Samaritan
Thou hast yhad fyue housbondes quod he
And þat ilk man which þat now haþ þe
Is nouȝt þin housbond þus he sayd certayn
what þat he ment þer by I can not sayn
But þat I axe why þe fyfte man
was nought housbond to þe Samaritan
How many might sche haue in mariage
Ȝit herd I neuer tellen in myn age
  
Vppon þis noumbre diffinicioun
Men may diuine and glosen vp and doun
But wel I wot wiþouten eny lye
God bad vs for to wax and multiplie
That gentil tixt can I wel vnderstonde
Ek wel I wot he sayd myn housebonde
Schuld lete fader and moder and folwe me  
But of no noumber mencioun made he
Of Bygamye or of Octogomye 
why schuld men speken of þat vilonye 
lo hier þe wise kyng Daun Salamon
I trow he hadde wyfes mo þan oon
As wold god it were leful vnto me
To be refreisshed half so oft as he
which ȝift of god had he for alle his wyuys
No man haþ such þat in þe world on lyue is
God wot þis nobil king as to my wit
The firste night had many a mery fit
with ech of hem so wel was him on lyue
Iblessid be god þat I haue weddid fyue
welcome þe sixte whan þat euer he schal
For sothe I nyl not kepe me chast in al
whan myn housbond is fro þe world Igon
Som cristne man schal wedde me anoon
For þan þapostil saith þat I am fre
To wedde a goddis haf wher so it be
he saith þat to be weddid is no synne
Bet is to be weddid þan to brynne
what recchith me what folk sayn viloyne
Of schrewith lameth or of Bigamye 
I wot wel abram was an holy man
And Iacob eek as ferforth as I can
And ech of hem had wyues mo than tuo
And many another holy man also
whan sawe ȝe in eny maner age
That highe god defendid mariage
  
By expres word I pray ȝow tellith me
Or wher comaunded he virginite
I wot as wel as ȝe it is no drede 
Thapostil whan he spekþ of maydenhede
he sayd þat precept þer of had he noon
Men may counseil a womman to be oon
But counselyng nys no comaundement
He put it in our owne Iuggement 
For hadde god comaundid maydenhede   
Than had he dampnyd weddyng with þe dede
And certes if þer were no seed Isowe 
Virginite · wheron schuld it growe
Poul ne dorst not comaunde atte lest
A þing of which his maister ȝaf non hest
The dart is set vpon virginite
Cach whoso may who rennith best  let se
But þis word is not taken of euery wight
But þer as god list ȝiue it of his might
I wot wel þat þapostil was a mayde
But naþeles þough þat he wrot or sayde
he wolde þat euery wight were such as he 
Al nys but counseil vnto virginite
And for to ben a wyf he ȝaf me leue
Of indigence  so nys it to repreue
to wedde me if þat my make deye
withoute excepcioun of bigamye
Al were it good to womman for to touche
he mente in his bed or in his couche
For peril is boþe fuyr an tow to assemble
Ȝe knowe what þis ensample wold resemble
This is al and som  he holdith virginite
More parfit þan weddyng in frelte
Frelte clepe I · but if þat he and sche
wold leden al her lif in chastite
I graunt it wel I haue noon enuye
Though maidenhede preferre bygamye
  
It likeþ hem to be clene in body and gost
Of myn estate I nyl make no bost
For wel ȝe wot a lord in his houshold
He nath not euery vessel ful of gold
Som ben of tre and don her lord seruise
God clepeth folk to him in sondry wise
And euery haþ of god a propre ȝifte
Som þis som þat as him likith to schifte
Virginite is gret perfeccioun
And continens eek wiþ gret deuocioun
But crist þat of perfeccioun is welle  
Bad nouȝt euery wight schuld go and selle
Al þat he had and ȝiue it to þe pore
And in such wise folwe him and his fore 
he spak to hem þat wolde lyue parfytly
But lordyngs by ȝour leue þat am not I
I wol bystowe þe flour of myn age 
In þe actes and in þe fruytes of mariage
Tel me also to what conclusioun
were membres maad of generacioun
And in what wise was a wight ywrouȝt
Trustith right wel þay were nouȝt maad for nouȝt
Glose whoso wol and say boþe vp and doun
þat þay were made for purgacioun
Oure boþe vryn and þinges smale 
was eek to knowe a femel fro a male
And for non oþer cause say ȝe no
Thexperiens wot wel it is not so 
So þat þese clerke ben not with me wroþe 
I say þis þat þay makid ben for boþe
Þat is to say for office and for ease
Of engendrure þer we god nouȝt displease
why schuld men ellis in her bokes sette
That man schal ȝelde to his wif his dette
Now wherwiþ schuld he paye his payement
If he ne vsed his sely instrument
  
Than were þay maad vp a creature
To purge vryn and eek for engendrure
By I say not þat euery wight is holde
That haþ such harneys as I to ȝow tolde
To gon and vsen hem in engendrure
Than schuld men take of chastite no cure
Crist was a mayde and schapen as a man
And many a seynt sin þat þe world bygan
Ȝit lyued þay euer in parfyt charite
I nyl enuye no virginite
let hem be bred of pured whete seed
And let vs wyues eten barly breed
And ȝet wiþ barly bred men telle can  
Oure lord refreisschid many a man
In such astaat as god haþ cleped ous
I wil perseuer I am not precious
In wyfhode I wil vse myn instrument
Als frely as my maker haþ me it sent
If I be daungerous god ȝiue me sorwe
Myn housbond schal han it at eue and at morwe
whan þat him list com forth and pay his dette
An housbond wol I haue I wol not lette 
which schal be boþe my dettour and my þral
And haue his tribulacioun wiþ al
vpon his fleissch whil þat I am his wyf
I haue þe power duryng al my lif
vpon his propre body and not he 
Right þus þapostil told it vnto me 
And bad oure housbondes for to loue vs wel
Al þis sentence me likith euery del
 vp start þe pardoner and þat anoon
Now dame quod he by god and by seint Iohn
Ȝe ben a noble prechour in þis caas
I was aboute to wedde a wif allaas
what schal I buy it on my fleisch so deere
Ȝit had I leuer wedde no wif to ȝere
  
Abyd quod sche my tale is not bygonne 
Nay þou schalt drinke of anoþer tonne
Er þat I go schal sauere wors þan ale
And whan þat I haue told þe forþ my tale
Of tribulacioun in mariage
I which I am expert in al myn age
This is to say my self haþ ben þe whippe
Than might þou chese wheþir þou wilt sippe
Of þilke tonne þat I schal abroche
Be war of it er þou to neigh approche
For I schal telle ensamples mo þan ten
whoso þat nyl be war by oþer men
By him schal oþer men corrected be
The same wordes writes protholome
Rede in his almagest and tak it þere  
Dame I wold pray ȝow  if þat ȝoure wille were
Sayde þis pardoner as ȝe bigan
Tel forth ȝoure tale sparith for no man
Teche vs ȝonge men of ȝoure practike
Gladly quod sche syns it may ȝow like
But þat I pray to al þis companye 
If þat I speke after my fantasie
As takeþ nouȝt agreef of þat I say
For myn entente is nought but to play 
NOw sires now wol I telle forth my tale
As euer mote I drinke wyn or ale
I schal say soþ of housbondes þat I hadde
As þre of hem were goode and tuo were badde
Tuo of hem were goode riche and olde
Vnnethes mighte þay þe statute holde
In which þat þay were bounden vnto me
Ȝe wot wel what I mene of þis par de
As help me god I laugh whan þat I þinke
how pitously on night I made hem swynke 
But by my fay I told of it no stoor
Thay had me ȝiue her lond and her tresor
  
Me nedith not no lenger doon diligence
To wynne her loue or doon hem reuerence
Thay loued me so wel by god aboue
That I tolde no deynte of her loue
A wys womman wol bysi hir euer in oon
To gete hir loue þere sche hath noon
But synnes I had hem holly in myn hond
And synnes þay had me ȝeuen al her lond
what schuld I take keep hem for to please
But it were for my profyt and myn ease 
I sette hem so on werke by my fay
That many a night þay songen weylaway
The bacoun was nought fet for hem I trowe
That som men fecche in Essex an donmowe
I gouerned hem so wel after my lawe
That ech of hem ful blisful was and fawe
To bringe me gaye þinges fro þe faire  
Þay were ful glad whan I spak to hem faire
For god it woot I chidde hem spitously
Now herkeneþ how I bar me proprely
Ȝe wise wyues þat can vnderstonde
Þus scholde ȝe speke and bere hem wrong on honde
For half so boldely can þer no man
Swere and lye as can a womman
I say not by wyues þat ben wise
But if it be whan þay ben mysauise
Iwis a wif if þat sche can hir good
schal beren him on hond þe cow is wood
And take witnes on hir oughne mayde 
Of hire assent but herkeniþ how I sayde
See olde Caynard is þis þin array
why is my neghebores wif so gay
Sche is honoured ouer al þer sche goth
I sitte at hom I haue no thrifty cloth 
what dostow at my neighebores hous
Is sche so fair  what artow amorous
  
what roune ȝe wiþ hir maydenes benedicite
Sir olde lecchour let þi iapes be
And if I haue a gossib or a frend
wiþouten gilt þou chidest as a fend
If þat I walk and play vnto his hous
Þou comest hom as dronken as a mous
And prechist on þy bench wiþ euel pree
Þou saist to me it is a gret meschief
To wedde a pouer womman for costage 
And if þat sche be riche and of parage
Thanne saist þou it is a tormentrie
To suffre hir pride and hir malencolie
And if þat sche be fair þou verray knaue
Þou saist þat euery holour wol hir haue
Sche may no while in chastite abyde
That is assayled þus on eche syde
Þou saist þat som folk desire vs for riches
Som for our schap and som for our fairnes
And some for þat sche can synge and daunce  
And some for gentilesse or daliaunce
Som for hir handes and hir armes smale 
Thus goth al to þe deuel by þi tale
Thou saist men may nought kepe a castel wal
Hit may so be biseged ouer al
And if sche be foul  þanne þou saist þat sche
Coueitith euery man þat sche may se 
For as a spaynel sche wol on him lepe
Til þat sche fynde som man hire to chepe
Ne noon so gray a goos goþ in þe lake 
As sayest þou wol be wiþouten make 
And saist it is an hard þing for to wolde
Thing þat no man wol  his willes holde
Thus seistow lorel whan þou gost to bedde
And þat no wys man nedith for to wedde 
Ne no man þat entendiþ vnto heuene
wiþ wilde þunder dynt and fuyry leuene
  
Mote þi wicked necke be tobroke 
Þou saist þat droppyng hous and eek smoke 
And chydyng wyues maken men to fle
Out of here oughne hous a benedicite
what eylith such an old man for to chyde 
Þou seist we wyues woln oure vices hide 
Til we ben weddid and þan we wil hem schewe
wel may þat be a prouerbe of a schrewe
Thou saist þat assen  oxen and houndes
Þay ben assayed at diuers stoundes
Basyns lauours eek er men hem bye
Spones  stooles  and al such housbondrie
Also pottes cloþes and array
But folk of wyues maken non assay
Til þay ben weddid olde dotard schrewe
And þanne saistow we woln oure vices schewe
Þou saist also þat it displesith me
But if þat þou wilt praysen my beaute
And but þou pore alway in my face
And clepe me faire dame in euery place
And but þou make a fest on þilke day  
Þat I was born and make me freisch and gay
And but þou do my norice honoure
And to my chamberer wiþinne þy boure
And to my fadres folk and myn allies
Thus saistow olde barel ful of lies
And ȝit of oure apprentys Iankyn
For his crisp her schynyng as gold so fyn
And for he squiereþ me vp and doun
Ȝet hastow caught a fals suspeccioun
I nyl him nought þough þou were deed to morwe
But tel me wherfor hydestow wiþ sorwe
Thy keyes of þy chist away fro me
It is my good as wel as þin par de
 what wenest þou make an ydiot of oure dame
Now by þat lord þat cleped is seint Iame
  
Thow schalt not bothe þough þou were wood
Be maister of my body and of my good
That oon þou schalt forgo maugre þin yen
what helpeth it on me tenqueren or espien
I trowe þou woldest lokke me in þy chest
Thou scholdist say  wif go wher þe lest
Take ȝoure disport I nyl lieue no talis
I know ȝow for a trewe wif dame alis
we loueþ no man þat takith keep or charge
wher þat we goon  we loue to be at large
 Of alle men Iblessed most he be
Þe wise astrologe daun protholome
That saith þis prouerbe  in his almagest
Of alle men his wisedom is highest
Þat rekkith not who haþ þe world in honde
By þis prouerbe  þou schalt vnderstonde 
Have þou ynough what þar þe recch or care
How merily þat oþer folkes fare
For certes olde dotard wiþ ȝour leue
Ȝe schul haue queynte right ynough at eue
he is to gret a nygard þat wol werne
A man to light a candel at his lanterne
he schal haue neuer þe lasse light par de  
Haue þou ynough þe thar not playne þe
Thou saist also þat if we make vs gay
with cloþing and with precious array
Þat it is peril of our chastite
And ȝit wiþ sorwe þou most enforce þe
And say þese wordes in thapostles name
In abyt maad wiþ chastite and schame
Ȝe wommen schuld apparayl ȝow quod he 
And nought wiþ tressed her  and gay perre 
As perles ne with golden cloþis riche
After þy text ne after þin rubriche
I wol nouȝt wirche as moche as a gnat
Thow saist þus þat I was lik a cat
  
But whoso wolde senge the cattes skyn
Than wold þe catte  duellen in his In
And if þe cattes skyn be slyk and gay
Sche wol not duelle in house half a day
But forth sche wil er eny day be dawet
To schewe hir skyn and goon a caterwrawet
This is to say if I be gay sir schrewe 
I wol renne aboute my borel for to schewe
Sir olde fool what helpith þe to aspien
Þough þou praydest argus wiþ his hundrid yen
To be my warde corps as he can best
In faith he schuld not kepe me but if me lest
Ȝit couþe I make his berd þough queynte he be
Þou saydest eek þat þer ben þinges þre
The whiche þinges troublen al þis erþe
And þat no wight may endure þe ferþe
O leue sire schrewe ihu schorte þy lif
Ȝit prechestow and saist an hateful wif
Irekened is for oon of þese meschaunces
Ben þer noon oþer of þy resemblaunces
Þat ȝe may liken ȝoure parables vnto
But if a cely wyf be oon of þo
Thow likenest wommannes loue to helle
To bareyn lond þer water may not duelle
Thou likenest it also to wilde fuyr  
The more it brenneth þe more it haþ desir
To consume euery þing þat brent wol be
Thou saist right as wormes schenden a tre
Right so a wif schendith hir housebonde
This knowen þo þat ben to wyues bonde
lordynges right þus as ȝe han vnderstonde
Bar I styf myn housebondes on honde
Þat þus þay sayde in her dronkenesse
And al was fals but þat I took witnesse
On Iankyn and vpon my nece also
O lord þe peyne I dede hem and þe wo
  
Ful gulteles by goddes swete pyne
For as an hors I couþe boþe bite and whyne
I couþe pleyne and ȝet I was in þe gilt
Or elles I hadde often tyme be spilt
whoso first comeþ to þe mylle first grynt
I pleyned first so was oure werre stynt
Thay were ful glad to excuse hem ful blyue
Of þing þat þay neuer agilt in her lyue
And wenches wold I beren hem on honde
whan þat for seek þay might vnnethes stonde
Ȝit tykeled I his herte for þat he
wende I had of him so gret chierete
I swor þat al my walkyng out a nyght
was for to aspie wenches þat he dight
vnder þat colour had I many a mirthe
For al such witte is ȝeuen vs of birthe
Deceipt wepyng  spynnyng  god haþ ȝiue
To wymmen kyndely whil þay may lyue
And þus of o thing I auaunte me 
And þende I had þe bet in ech degre
By sleight or fors or of som maner þing
As by continuel murmur or chidyng
Namly on bedde hadden þay meschaunce
Ther wold I chide and do hem no plesaunce
I wold no lenger in þe bed abyde 
If þat I felt his arm ouer my syde
Til he had maad his raunsoun vnto me  
Than wold I suffre him doon his nycete
And þerfor euery man þis tale telle
wynne whoso may for al is for to selle
wiþ empty hond men may noon haukes lure
For wynnyng wold I al his lust endure
And make me a feyned appetyt
And ȝit in bacoun had I neuer delyt
That made me þat euer I wold hem chyde
For þough þe pope had seten hem bisyde
  
I nold not spare hem at her oughne bord
For by my trouþe I quyt hem word for word
Als help me verray god omnipotent 
Þough I right now schuld make my testament
I owe hem nought a word þat it nys quitte
I brought it so aboute by my witte
Þat þay most ȝeue it vp as for þe best
Or ellis had we neuer ben in rest
For þough he loked as a grym lyoun
Ȝit schuld he fayle of his conclusioun
Than wold I say  now goode leef tak keep
how mekly lokith wilkyn oure scheep
Com ner my spouse let me ba þy cheke
Ȝe schulde be al pacient and meke
And haue a swete spiced consciens
Siþþen ȝe preche so of Iopes paciens
Suffreth alway syns ȝe so wel can preche
And but ȝe do certeyn we schul ȝow teche 
That it is fair to haue a wyf in pees
On of vs tuo mot bowe douteles
And siþþen man is more resonable
Than womman is  ȝe moste be suffrable
what aylith ȝow  þus for to grucche and grone
Is it for ȝe wold haue my queynt allone 
why tak it al  lo haue it euery del
Peter I schrewe ȝow but ȝe loue it wel
For if I wolde selle my bele chose 
I couþe walk as freisch as eny rose
But I wol kepe it for ȝoure owne toth  
Ȝe ben to blame by god I say ȝow soth 
Such maner wordes hadde we on honde
Now wol I speke of my fourth housbonde 
My fourþe housbond was a reuelour
This is to say he had a paramour
I was ȝong and ful of ragerie
Stiborn and strong and ioly as a pye
  
how couþe I daunce to an harpe smale
And synge ywys as eny nightyngale
whan I had dronke a draught of swete wyn
Metillius þe foule cherl þe swyn
That with a staf byraft his wyf hir lyf
For sche drank wyn þough I had ben his wif
Ne schuld nouȝt haue daunted me fro drink
And after wyn on venus most I þink
For also siker as cold engendrith hayl
A likorous mouth most haue a licorous tail
In wymmen vinolent is no defens
This knowen lecchours by experiens
But lord crist whan þat it remembrith me
vpon my ȝouthe and on my iolite
It tikelith me aboute myn herte roote
Vnto þis day it doþ myn herte boote
That I haue had my world as in my tyme
But age allas þat al wol enuenyme
Haþ me bireft my beaute and my pith
Let go far wel  þe deuyl go þer wiþ
The flour is goon þer nis no more to telle
The bran as I best can now mot I selle
But ȝit to be mery wol I fonde 
Now wol I telle of my fourt housbonde
I say I had in herte gret despyt
That he of eny oþer had delit
But he was quit by god and by seint Ioce
I made him of þe same woode a croce
Nought of my body in no foul manere
But certeynly I made folk such chere
That in his owne grees I made him frie  
For anger and for ialousie
By god in erþe I was his purgatory
For which I hope his soule be in glory
For god it wot  he sat ful stille and song
whan þat his scho ful bitterly him wrong
  
Ther was no wight sauf god and he þat wist
In many wyse how sore I him twist
I sayde whan I cam fro Ierusalem
And lith Igraue vnder þe roode bem
Al is his tombe nought so curious
As was þe sepulcre of him Darius
which þat appellus wrought so subtily
It nys but wast to burie him preciously
let him far wel god ȝiue his soule rest
he is now in his graue and in his chest
 Now of my fifte housbond wol I telle 
God let his soule neuer come in helle 
And ȝit was he to me þe moste schrewe 
That fele I on my ribbes alle on rewe 
And euer schal vnto myn endyng day
But in oure bed he was so freisch and gay
And þer with al so wel he couþe me glose 
whan þat he wolde haue my bele chose 
That þough he had me bete on euery boon
he couþe wynne my loue right anoon
I trowe I loued him beste for þat he
was of his loue daungerous to me
we wymmen han if þat I schal nouȝt lye
In þis matier a queynte fantasie
wayte what þyng we may not lightly haue
Ther after wol we sonnest crie and craue
Forbeed vs þing and þat desire we
Pres on vs fast and þanne wol we fle
wiþ daunger outen alle we oure ware
Greet pres at market makith deer chaffare
And to greet chep is holden at litel pris
This knowith euery womman þat is wys
My fyfte housbond god his soule blesse  
which þat I took for loue and no richesse 
he somtyme was a clerk of Oxenford
And had left scole and went at hoom to borde
  
wiþ my gossib duellyng in oure toun
God haue hir soule hir name was Alisoun
Sche knew myn herte and my priuite
Bet þan oure parisch prest so mot I the 
To hir bywreyed I my counseil al
For had myn housbond pissed on a wal
Or don a þing þat schuld haue cost his lif
To hir and to anoþer worþy wyf
And to my neece which I loued wel
I wold haue told his counseil euery del
And so I did ful ofte god it woot
That made his face ofte reed and hoot
For verry schame and blamyd himself þat he 
had told to me so gret a priuete
And so byfel þat oones in a lent
So ofte tyme to my gossib I went
For euer ȝit I loued to be gay
And for to walk in march aueril and may
From hous to here sondry talis
Þat Iankyn Clerk and my gossib dame alis
And I my self in to þe feldes went
Myn housbond was at londone al þat lent
I had þe bettir leysir for to pleye
And for to see and eek for to be seye
Of lusty folk what wist I wher my grace
was schapen for to be or in what place
Therfore I made my visitaciouns
To vigiles and to processiouns
To prechings eek and to þis pilgrimages
To pleyes miracles and mariages
And wered vpon my scarlet gytes
Þese wormes þese moughtes ne þese mytes
Vpon my perel fretith hem neuer a deel
And wostow why for þay were vsed wel
Now wol I telle forþ what happid me  
I say þat in þe feldes walkid we
  
Til trewely we had such daliaunce
This Clerk and I þat of my puruyaunce
I spak to him and sayde how þat he
If I were wydow schulde wedde me
For certeynly I say for no bobaunce
Ȝit was I neuer wiþouten purueyaunce
Of mariage ne of no þinges eeke
I hold a mouses hert not worþ a leek
That haþ but oon hole to sterte to
And if þat faile þan is al Ido
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
But now sir let me se what I schal sayn
A ha by god I haue my tale agayn
 whan þat my fourþe housbond was on bere
I wept algate and made a sory cheere
As wyues mooten for it is vsage
And with my kerchief couered my visage
But for þat I was purueyed of a make 
I wept but smal and þat I vndertake
To chirche was myn housbond brought on morwe
with neighebors þat for him made sorwe
And Iankyn oure clerk was oon of þo
As help me god whan þat I saugh him go
After þe beere me þought he had a paire
Of legges and of feet so clene and faire
That al myn hert I ȝaf vnto his hold
He was I trowe twenty wynter old
  
And I was fourty I schal say þe sothe
But ȝit I had alway a Coltis toþe
Gattothid I was and þat bycom me wel
I had þe prynte of seynt Venus sel
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Myn ascent was taur and mars þer Inne 
Allas alas þat euer loue was synne
I folwed ay myn inclinacioun
By vertu of my constillacioun
That made me þat I couþe nouȝt wiþdrawe 
My chambre of venus from a good felawe 
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
what schuld I say but at þe monthis ende  
This ioly clerk Iankyn þat was so heende
Haþ weddid me with gret solempnitee
And to him ȝaf I al þe londe and fee
That euer was me ȝiue þer bifore
But aftirward repented me ful sore
he nolde suffre noþing of my list
By god he smot me oones wiþ his fist
For I rent oones out of his book a lef
That of þat strok myn eere wax al deef
  
Styborn I was as is a leones
And of my tonge a verray iangleres
And walk I wold as I had don biforn
Fro hous to hous al þough he had it sworn
For which he ofte tyme wolde preche
And me of olde Romayn gestes teche 
How he Simplicius gallus left his wyf
And hir forsok for terme of al his lyf
Nought but for open heedid he hir say
lokyng out at his dore vpon a day
Anoþer Romayn told he me by name
That for his wyf was at a somer game
wiþout his wityng he forsok hir eeke
And þanne wold he vpon his book seeke
That ilke prouerbe of Ecclesiaste
wher he comaundith and forbedith faste
Man schal not suffre his wyf go roule aboute 
Than wold he say right þus wiþouten doute
 Who þat buyldith his hous al of salwes
And priketh his blynde hors ouer the falwes
And suffrith his wyf to go seken halwes
Is worþy to ben honged on þe galwes
But al for nought I sette nought an hawe
Of his prouerbe ne of his olde sawe
Ne I wolde not of him corrected be
I hate him þat my vices tellith me
And so doon mo god it wot þan I
This made him wiþ me wood al outerly
I nolde not forbere him in no cas  
Now wol I say ȝow soth by seint Nicholas
why þat I rent out of þe book a leef
For which he smot me þat I was al def
he had a book þat gladly night and day
For his desport he wolde rede alway
he clepyd it Valelye and theofrast
At which book he lough alway ful fast
  
And eek þay say þer was som tyme at Rome
A clerk a Cardynal þat heet seint Ierome
That made a book aȝens Iouynyan
In which book eeke þer was terculan
Crisippus tortula and eek helewys
That was abbas not fer fro paris
And eek þe parablis of Salamon
Ouydes art and bourdes many oon
And alle þese were bounde in oo volume
And euery night and day was his custume
whan he had leysir and vacacioun
From oþer worldes occupacioun
To reden in þis book of wikked wyues
he knew of hem mo legendes and lyues
Þan ben of goode wyues in þe bible
For trustith wel it is an inpossible
That any clerk schal speke good of wyues
But if it be of holy seintes lyues
Ne of noon oþer wyfes neuer þe mo
who peyntid þe leoun tel me who
By god if wommen hadde writen stories
As clerkes haue wiþinne her oratories
Thay wold haue write of men more wickidnes
Than al þe mark of Adam may redres
These children of mercury and of venus
Ben in her werkyng ful contrarius
Mercury louith wisdom and science
And venus loueth ryot and dispense
And for her diuers disposicioun
Ech fallith in oþeres exaltacioun
And þus god wot mercury is desolate  
In pisses wher venus is exaltate
And venus faylith wher Mercury is reysed
Therfor no womman of clerkes is preised
The clerk whan he is old and may nouȝt do
Of venus werkis is not worþ a scho
  
Than sit he doun and writ in his dotage
That wommen can nought kepe here mariage
But now to purpos why I tolde þe
That I was beten for a leef par de
vpon a night Iankyn þat was oure sire
Rad on his book as he sat by þe fyre
Of Eua first þat for hir wikkidnes
was al mankynde brought to wrecchednes
    
    
    
    
Tho rad he me how Sampson left his heris
Slepyng his lemman kut it wiþ hir scheris
Thurgh which tresoun lost he boþe his yen
Tho rad he me if þat I schal not lyen
Of Ercules and of his deianyre
That caused him to sette himself on fuyre
No þing forȝat he þe care and wo
Þat Socrates had wiþ his wyues tuo
How exantipa cast pisse vpon his heed
Þis seely man sat stille as he were deed
he wyped his heed no more durst he sayn
But er þunder stynte þer comeþ rayn
Of phasipha þat was þe queen Creete
For schrewednes him þought þe tale sweete
Fy spek no more it is a grisly þing
For her horribil lust and her likyng
Of Clydemystra for hir leccherie
That falsly made hir housbond for to dye
he rad it with ful good deuocioun
he told me eek for what occasioun
Amphiores at Thebes left his lif
Myn housbond had a legend of his lyf
Exiphilem þat for an ouche of gold
haþ prively vnto þe Grekes told
  
wher þat hir housbond hyd him in a place  
For which he had at thebes sory grace
Of lyma told he me and of lucye
Thay boþe made her housbondes for to dye 
That oon for loue · þat oþer was for hate
Lyma hir housbond on an euen late
Empoysond hath  for þat sche was his fo
Lucia licorous loued hir housbond so
For þat he schuld alway vpon hir þink
Sche ȝaf him such a maner louedrink
That he was deed er it was by þe morwe
And þus algates housbondes had sorwe
Than told he me how oon latumyus
Compleigned vnto his felaw arrius
That in his gardyn growed such a tre
On which he sayde how þat his wyues þre 
Honged hem selfe  for herte despitous
O leue broþer  quod þis arrious
Ȝif me a plont of þilke blessid tre
And in my gardyn schal it plantid be
Of latter date of wyues haþ he red
That som han slayn her housbondes in her bed
And let her lecchour dighten al þe night
whil þat þe corps lay in þe flor vpright
And som han dryuen nayles in her brayn
whiles þay sleepe and þus þey han hem slayn
Som haue hem ȝiue poysoun in her drink
he spak more harm þan herte may byþynk
And þer wiþ al he knew mo prouerbes
Þan in þis world þer growen gres or herbes
Better is quod he thyn habitacioun
Be with a leoun or a foul dragoun
Than with a womman vsyng for to chyde
Better is quod he hihe in þe roof abyde
Than wiþ a wikked womman doun in a hous
Thay ben so wicked and so contrarious
  
Þay haten þat her housbondes louen ay
He sayd a womman cast hir schame away
whan sche cast of hir smok  and forþer mo  
A fair womman but sche be chast also
Is lyk a gold ryng in a sowes nose
who wolde wene or who wolde suppose 
The wo þat in myn herte was and pyne
And whan I saugh he nolde neuer fyne
To reden on þis cursed book al night
And sodeinly þre leues haue I plight
Out of þis booke þat he had and eeke
I with my fist so took him on þe cheeke
That in oure fuyr he fel bakward adoun·
And he vpstert as doþ a wood leoun
And wiþ his fist he smot me on þe hed
That in þe floor I lay as I were deed
And whan he saugh so stille þat I lay
he was agast and wold haue fled away
Til atte last out of my swown I brayde
O hastow slayn me false þef I sayde
And for my lond þus hastow mourdrid me
Er I be deed ȝit wol I kisse þe
And ner he cam and knelith faire a doun
And sayde deere suster alisoun
As help me god I schal þe neuer smyte
That I haue doon it is þiself to wite 
Forȝiue it me and þat I þe biseke
And ȝet eft sones I hyt him on þe cheke
And sayde þef þus mekil I me wreke
Now wol I dye I may no lenger speke
But atte last wiþ mochil care and wo
we fyl accordid by our seluen tuo
he ȝaf me al þe bridil in myn hand
To haue þe gouernaunce of hous and land
And of his tonge and of his hond also 
And made him brenne his book anoon right þo
  
And whan I hadde geten vnto me
By maistry al þe souereynete
And þat he sayde myn owne trewe wif
Do as þe list in term of al þy lif
kepe þyn honour and kep eek myn estat  
And after þat day we neuer had debat
God help me so I was to him as kynde
As eny wyf fro Denmark vnto Inde
And also trewe was he vnto me
I pray to god þat sitte in mageste
So blesse his soule for his mercy deere
Now wol I say my tale if ȝe wol heere
 The Frere lough when he had herd al þis
Now dame quod he so haue I ioye or blis
This is a long preambel of a tale
And whan þe Sompnour herd þe frere gale
Lo quod þe sompnour for goddes armes tuo
A frer wol entremet him euermo
lo goode men a flie and eek a frere
woln falle in euery dissche and matiere
what spekst þou of  perambulacioun
what ambil  or trot  or pees or go sit doun
Thou lettest oure disport in þis matere
Ȝe woltow so sir sompnour quod þe frere
Now by my fay I schal er þat I go
Telle of a sompnour such a tale or tuo
That alle þe folk schuln laughen in þis place 
Now ellis frere I byschrew þy face
Quod þis Sompnour and I byschrewe me
But  if I telle tales tuo or þre
Of freres er I come to Sydingborne
Þat I schal make þin herte for to morne
  
For wel I wot þy paciens is goon
Oure hoste cride pees and þat anoon
And sayde let þe womman telle hir tale 
Ȝe fare as folkes þat dronken ben of ale
Do dame tel forth ȝour tale and þat is best
Al redy sir quod sche right as ȝou lest
If I haue licence of þis worthy frere
Ȝis dame quod he tel forþ and I schal heere
IN olde dayes of þe kyng arthour  
Of which þat britouns speken gret honour
Al was þis lond fulfilled of fayrie
The elf queen wiþ hir ioly compaignye
Daunced fuloft in many a grene mede
This was þe old oppynyoun as I rede
I speke of many hundrid ȝer ago
But now can no man see noon elues mo
For now þe grete charite and prayeres
Of lymytours and oþer holy freres
That sechen euery lond and euery streem
As thik as motis in þe sonne beem
Blessynge halles  chambres  kichenes  boures
Citees  burghes  castels  hihe and toures 
Thropes  bernes  schepnes  and dayeries
That makith þat þer ben no fayeries
For þer as wont was to walken an elf
Ther walkith noon  but þe lymytour himself
In vndermeles and in morwenynges
And saith his matyns and his holy þinges
As he goþ in his lymytacioun
wommen may go saufly vp and doun
In euery bussch or vnder euery tre
Þer is non oþer incumbent but he 
And ne wol but doon hem dishonour
And so bifel it  þat þis king arthour
had in his hous a lusty bacheler
That on a day com rydyng fro ryuer
  
And happed al alone as sche was born
he saugh a mayde walkyng him byforn
Of which mayden anoon maugre hir heed
By verray fors byraft hir maydenhed
For such oppressioun was such clamour
And such pursuyte vnto kyng arthour
That dampned was þe knight and schuld be ded
By cours of lawe and schuld haue lost his heed
Parauenture such was þe statut þo
But þat þe queen and oþer ladys mo
So longe preyeden þay þe kyng of grace  
Til he his lif haþ graunted in þe place
And ȝaf him to þe queen al at hir wille
To chese wethir sche wolde him saue or spille
The queen thanked þe kyng wiþ al hir might
And after þus sche spak vnto þe knight
whan þat sche saugh hir tyme vpon a day
Thow stondest ȝet quod he in such array
Þat of þy lyf hastow no sewerte
I graunte þy lif if þou canst telle me
what þing is it þat wommen most desiren
Be war and keep þy nek bon fro þe Iren
And if þou canst not tellen it anoon
Ȝet wol I ȝiue þe leue for to goon
A twelf month and a day it for to lere
An answar suffisaunt in þis matiere
And seurte wol I haue er þat þou pace
Thy body for to ȝelden in þis place
wo was þis knight and sorwfully he siked
But what he may not doon al as him liked
And atte last he ches him for to wende
And cam aȝein right at þe ȝeres ende
wiþ swich answer as god him wolde purueye
And takith his leue and wendith forþ his weye
He sekith euery hous and euery place
wherso he hopith for to fynde grace
  
To lerne what þing wommen louen most
But he ne couþe arryuen in no cost
wher as he mighte fynde þis matiere
To þese þinges accordyng in fere
Somme sayden womme louen best richesse
Somme sayde honour and some sayde iolynesse
Somme sayde riche array some sayden lust on bedde
And ofte tyme to be wydow and wedde
Somme sayden oure herte is most Ieased
whan we ben yflaterid and ypleased
He goþ ful neigh þe soth I wil not lye
A man schal wynne vs best wiþ flaterye
And with attendaunce and busynesse  
Ben we ylimed boþe more and lesse 
And somme sayen þat we louen best
For to be fre and to doon as vs lest
And þat no man repreue vs of oure vice
But say þat we ben wys and no þing nyce
For trewely þer is noon of vs alle
If eny wight wold claw vs on þe galle 
That we nyl like for he saith vs soþ
Assay and he schal fynd it þat so doþ
For be we neuer so vicious wiþinne
we schuln be holde wys and clene of synne
And somme sayn þat gret delit han we
For to be holden stabil and secre 
And in oon purpos stedfastly to duelle 
And nought bywreye þing þat men vs telle 
But þat tale is not  worth a rakes stele
Par dy we wymmen  can right no þing hele
witnes on myda wil ȝe here þe tale 
Ouyd among his oþer þinges smale
Sayde Myda had  vnder his lange heris
Growyng vpon his heed tuo asses eeris
The whiche vice he hid as he best might
Ful subtilly fro euery mannes sight
  
That saue his wyf þer wist of þat no mo
he loued hir most  and trusted hir also 
he prayed hir  þat to no creature
sche schulde tellen  of his disfigure 
Sche swor him nay for al þis world to wynne
Sche nolde do þat vilony or synne
To make hir housbond haue so foul a name
Sche wold not tel it for hir oughne schame
But natheles hir þoughte þat sche dyde
That sche so long a counseil scholde hyde
hir þought it swal  so sore about  hir hert
That needely som word hir most astert
And sins sche dorst not tel it vnto man
Doun to a marreys faste by sche ran
Til sche cam þer hir herte was on fuyre  
And as a bytoure bumblith in þe myre
Sche layd hir mouth vnto þe water doun
Bywrey me not þou watir with þi soun
Quod sche to þe I telle it and no mo
Myn housbond haþ long asse eeris tuo
Now is myn hert al hool now is it oute
I might no lenger kepe it out of doute
Her may ȝe se þeigh we a tyme abyde
Ȝet out it moot we can no counseil hyde
The remenaunt of þe tale if ȝe wil here 
Redith ovid  and þer ȝe mow it leere
 This knight of which my tale is specially
whan þat he saugh he might nouȝt come þerby
This is to say what wommen louen most
wiþinne his brest ful sorwful was þe gost
But hom he goþ  he might no lenger soiourne
The day was come þat homward most he torne
And in his way it hapnyd him to ride
In al his care vnder a forest side
wher as he saugh vpon a daunce go
Of ladys four and twenty and ȝit mo
  
Toward þis ilke daunce I drough ful ȝerne 
In hope þat som wisdom schuld I lerne 
But certeynly er I com fully þere
Vanysshid was þis daunce he nyste where 
No creature saugh he þat bar lif
Sauf on þe greene he saugh sittyng a wyf 
A fouler wight þer may no man deuyse
Aȝens þe knight þis olde wyf gan ryse
And sayder sir knight heer forth lith no way
Tel me what  ȝe seekyn by ȝour fay
Par aduenture  it may þe better be 
Thise olde folk can mochil þing quod sche
My lieue modir quod þis knight certayn
I am but ded but if þat I can sayn
what þing is it  þat wommen most desire
Couþe ȝe me wisse  I wold wel quyt ȝour huyre 
Plight me þy trouth  her in myn hond quod sche  
The nexte þing þat I require þe
Thou schalt it doo if it be in þy might
And I wol telle it þe er it be night
haue her my trouþe quod þe knight I graunte
Thanne quod sche I dar me wel auaunte
Þy lif is sauf for I wol stonde þer by
vpon my lif þe queen wol say as I
let se which is þe proudest of hem alle
Þat werith on a couerchief or a calle
Þat dar say nay of þing I schal þe teche
let vs go forth wiþouten more speche
Tho rowned sche a pistil in his eere
And bad him to be glad and haue no fere
whan þay ben comen to þe court þis knight
Sayd he had holde  þat day þat he hight
Al redy was his answer as he sayde
Ful many a noble wyf and many a mayde
And many a wydow for þat þay ben wyse
The queen hirself sittyng as a Iustise
  
Assemblid ben his answer for to hiere
And afterward þis knight was bode appiere
To euery wight comaundid was cilence
And þat þe knight schuld telle in audience
what þing þat worldly wommen louen best
 Þe knight ne stood not stille as doþ a best
But to þe questioun anoon answerde
wiþ manly voys þat al the court it herde
My liege lady generally quod he
wommen desiren to haue soueraynte
As wel ouer hir housbond as ouer hir loue
And for to be in maystry him aboue
This is þe most desir þough ȝe me kille 
Doþ as ȝow list I am heer at ȝour wille
In al þe court ne was þer wyf ne mayde
Ne wydow þat contraried þat he sayde
But sayden he  was worþy haue his lif
And wiþ þat word vp start þat olde wif
which þat þe knight saugh sittyng on þe grene  
Mercy quod sche my soueraigne lady queene
Er þat ȝour court departe doþ me right
I taughte þis answer vnto þe knight
For which he plighte me his trouþe there
The firste þing þat I wold him requere
he wold it do if it lay in his might
Bifore þe court þen pray I þe sir knight
Quod sche þat þou me take vnto þy wif
For wel þou wost þat I haue kept þy lif
If I say fals sey nay vpon þy fey
This knight answerd allas and waylawey
I wot right wel þat such was my byhest
For goddes loue as chese a ne request
Tak al my good and let my body go
Nay quod sche þan I schrew vs boþe tuo
For þough þat I be foule old and poure
I nolde for al þe metal ne for þe oure
  
That vnder erthe is graue or lith aboue
But I þy wife  were and eek þy loue
My loue quod he  nay nay  my dampnacioun
Allas þat eny of my nacioun
Schuld euer so foule disparagid be
But al for nought  þe ende is þis þat he
Constreigned was  he needes most hir wedde
And takith his wyf and goþ wiþ hir to bedde
 Now wolden som men say par aduenture
That for my necgligence I do no cure
To telle ȝow þe ioye and tharray
That at þat fest was maad þat ilke day
To which þing schortly answeren I schal
And say þer nas feste ne ioy at al
Ther nas but heuynes and mochil sorwe
For priuely he weddyd hir in a morwe
And alday hudde him  as doþ an oule
So wo was him his wyf loked so foule
Gret was þe wo  þe knight had in his þought
whan he was with his wyf on bedde brought
He walwith and he torneth to and fro  
his olde wyf lay smylyng euer mo
And sayd o deere housbond benedicite
Fareth euery knight wiþ his wyf as ȝe 
Is þis þe lawe of king arthures hous
Is euery knight of his þus daungerous
I am ȝour oughne loue  and ȝour wyf
I am sche þat hath sauyd ȝour lyf
And certes ne dede I ȝow neuer vnright
why fare ȝe þus with me þe firste night
ȝe fare lik a man þat had left his wit
what is my gult  for godes loue tel me it
And it schal be amendid if þat I may
Amendid quod þis knight allas nay nay
It wol nought ben amendid neuer mo
Thow art so loþly and so old also
  
And þerto comen of so lowh a kynde
That litil wonder is þough I walwe and wynde
So wolde god myn herte wolde brest
Is þis quod sche þe cause of ȝour vnrest
Ȝe certeynly quod he no wonder is
Now sire quod sche I couþe amende al þis
If þat me list er it were dayes þre 
So wel ȝe mighte bere ȝow to me
But for ȝe speken of such gentilesse
As is descendit out of old richesse
Therfor schuld ȝe  ben holden gentil men
Such arrogaunce  is not worth an hen
lok who þat is most vertuous alway
Priue and pert and most entendiþ ay
To do þe gentil dedes þat he can
Tak him for þe grettest gentil man
Crist wol we clayme of him oure gentilesse
Nought of oure eldres for our gret richesse
For þough þey ȝiue vs al her heritage
For which we clayme to be of high parage
Ȝit may þay not biqueþe for no þing
To noon of vs so vertuous lyuyng
That made hem gentil men ycallid be  
And bad vs folwe hem in such degre
wel can þe wyse poet of Florence
That hatte Daunt speke of þis sentence 
Lo in such maner of rym is Dauntes tale
Ful seeld vprisith by his braunchis smale 
Prowes of man  for god of his prowesse
wol þat we clayme of him our gentilesse
For of our auncestres  we no þing clayme
But temporal þing þat men may hurt and mayme
Ek euery wight wot þis as wel as I
If gentiles were plaunted naturelly
Vnto a certayn lignage doun þe line
Priue ne apert þay wolde neuer fine
  
To don of gentilesce þe fair office
Thay might nought doon no vileny or vice
Tak fuyr and ber it in þe derkest hous
Bitwixe þis  and þe mount Cankasous
And let men schit  þe dores and go þenne
Ȝit wol þe fuyr as fair and lighte brenne
As twenty þousand men might it biholde
his office naturel ay wol it holde
vp peril on my lif til þat it dye
her  may ȝe se wel how þat genterye
Is nought annexid to possessioun
Sithins folk ne doon her operacioun
Alway as doth þe fuyr lo in his kynde
For god it wot men may ful often fynde
A lordes sone do schame and vilonye
And he þat wol haue pris of his gentrie
For he was boren of a gentil hous
And had his eldres noble and vertuous
And nyl himselue  doo no gentil dedis
Ne folw his gentil aunceter þat deed is
he is nought gentil be he duk or erl 
For vileyn synful deedes makeþ a cherl 
For gentilnesse nys but renome
Of þin auncestres for her heigh bounte
which is a straunge þing to þy persone  
Thy gentilesce comeþ fro god alloone
Than comþ oure verray gentilesse of grace
It was no þing biquethe vs wiþ oure place
Thinkeþ how nobil as saith valerius
was þilke tullius hostilius
That out of pouert  ros to high noblesse
Redith Senek and redith eek Boece 
Ther schuln ȝe se expresse þat no dred is
Þat he is gentil þat doþ gentil dedis
And þerfor lieue housbond I conclude
Al were it that myn auncetres wer rude
  
Ȝit may þe highe god and so hope I
Graunte me grace to lyue vertuously
Than am I gentil whan þat I bygynne
To lyue vertuously and weyuen synne
And þer as ȝe of povert me repreue
The heighe god on whom þat we bilieue
In wilful pouert ches to lese his lif
And certes euery man  mayden or wif
May vnderstonde þat Ihc heuen king
Ne wold not chese  a vicious lyuyng
Glad pouert is an honest þing certayn
This wol Senek and oþer clerkes sayn
who þat holt him payd of his pouert
I hold him riche  al had he nouȝt a schert
he þat coueitith is a pore wight
For he wold haue þat is not in his might
But he þat nouȝt haþ  ne coueyteth nouȝt to haue
Is riche al þough ȝe hold him but a knaue
Verray pouert is synne proprely
Iuuenal saith of pouert merily
 The pore man whan he goþ by þe way
Bifore þe theues he may synge and play
Pouert is hateful and as I gesse 
A ful gret brynger out of busynesse 
A gret amender eek of Sapiens
To him þat takith it in paciens
Pouert is þis al þough it seme elenge  
Possessioun þat no wight wil chalenge
  Pouert ful often whan a man is lowe
Makith him his god and eek himself to knowe
  Pouert a spectacle is as þinkith me
Þurgh which he may his verray frendes se
And þerfor sir syth þat I ȝow nought greue
Of my pouert no more ȝe me repreue
 Now sir of elde ȝe repreue me
And certes sir þough noon auctorite
  
were in no book ȝe gentils of honour
Sayn þat men schuld an old wight doon fauour
And clepe him fader for ȝour gentilesse
And certes I schal fynden as I gesse
Than drede ȝou nought to ben a cokewold
Now þer þat ȝe sayn I am foul and old
For filthe and elde also mot I the
Ben grete wardeyns vpon chastite 
But natheles sith I knowe ȝour delyt
I schal fulfille ȝoure worldly appetyt
Chese now quod sche oon of þese þinges tweye
To haue me foul and old til þat I deye
And be to ȝow a trewe humble wyf
And neuer ȝow displease in al my lyf
Or elles ȝe wol haue me ȝong and fair
And take ȝour auenture of þe repair
Þat schal be to ȝour hous by cause of me
Or in som oþer place may wel be
Now chese ȝour seluen whethir þat ȝow likith
This knight auysith him and sore sikith
But atte last he sayd in þis manere
My lady and my loue  and my wif so deere
I putte me in ȝour wyse gouernaunce
Chesith ȝour self which may be most pleasaunce
And most honour to ȝow and me also
I do no fors þe wheþer of þe tuo
For as ȝow likith it suffisith me
Than haue I gete of ȝow þe maystry quod sche 
Sith I may gouern and chese as me list  
Ȝe certis wyf quod he I hold it best
kys me quod sche we ben no lenger wroþe
For by my trouþe  I wol be to ȝow boþe
This is to say ȝe boþe fair and good
I pray to god þat I mot sterue wood
But I be to ȝow also good and trewe
As euer was wyf siþþen þe world was newe
  
And but I be to morow as fair to seen
As eny lady emperesse or queen
That is bitwixe thest and eek þe west
Doth by my lyf  right euen as ȝow lest
Cast vp þe cortyns and look what þis is
And whan þe knyght saugh verrayly al þis
That sche so fair was and so ȝong þer to
For ioye he hent hir in hir armes tuo
his herte bathid in a bath of blisse
A thousand tyme on rowe he gan hir kisse
And sche obeyed him in euery þing
That mighte doon him pleisauns or likyng
And þus þay lyue vnto her lyues end
In parfyt ioye and ihū crist vs sende
housbondes meke ȝonge and freissche on bedde
And grace to ouerbyde hem þat we wedde
And eek I pray to Ihū schort her lyues
That wil nought be gouerned after her wyues
And old and angry nygardes of despense
God send hem sone verray pestilence 
THis worthy lymytour þis noble Frere
he made alway a lourynge cheere
vpon the sompnour  but for honeste 
No vileyns worde  ȝit to him spak he
But atte last he sayd vnto þe wyf
Dame quod he  god ȝiue ȝow good lyf
Ȝe han her touchid al so mot I the
In scole matier gret difficulte
Ȝe han sayd mochel þing right wel I say  
But dame right as we ryden by þe way
Vs needeþ nouȝt but for to speke of game ·
And lete auctorites in goddes name
To preching and to scoles of clergie 
But if it like to þis companye 
I wil ȝow of a sompnour telle a game
Par de ȝe may wel knowe by þe name
That of a sompnour may no good be sayd
I pray ȝow þat noon of ȝow be euel apayd
A Sompnour is a renner vp and doun
wiþ maundementȝ for fornicacioun
And is ybete at euery tounes eende 
Our oste spak  a sir ȝe schold been heende 
And curteys as a man of ȝour estaat
In company we wol haue no debaat
Telleþ ȝour tale and let þe sompnour be
Nay quoþ þe sompnour let him say to me
what so him list whan it comeþ to my lot
By god I schal him quyten euery grot
I schal him telle which a gret honour
Is to ben a fals flateryng lymytour
And his offis I schal him telle Iwis
Our host answerd and sayd þe sompnour þis
And after þis he sayd vnto þe Frere
Telleþ forþ ȝour tale my maister deere
Whilom þer was duellyng in my countre
An erchedeken a man of gret degre
That boldely did execucioun
In punyschyng of fornicacioun
Of wicchecraft and eek of Bauderye
Of diffamacioun and auoutrie 
Of chirchereues and of testamentes
Of contractes and of lak of sacraments
And eek of many anoþer cryme
which nediþ not to reherse at þis tyme
Of vsur and of Symony also
But certes lecchours did he grettest woo 
Thay schulde synge if þay were hent  
And smale tyþers þay were fouly schent
If eny persoun wold vpon hem pleyne
Ther might astert him no pecunial peyne
For smale tyþes and for smal offrynge
he made þe poeple pitously to synge
For er þe bisschop caught him in his hook
Þay weren in þe archedeknes book
And hadde þurgh his iurediccioun
Power to haue of hem correccioun
he had a sompnour redy to his hond
A slyer boy was noon in Engelond
Ful priuely he had his espiaile
That taughte him wher he might auayle
he couþe spare of lecchours oon or tuo
And techen him to four and twenty mo
For þough þis sompnour wood were as an hare
To telle his harlottry I wol not spare
  
For we ben out of here correccioun
Thay haue of vs no iurediccioun
Ne neuer schul to terme of alle her lyues
Peter so been þe wommen of þe styues
Thay beþ Iput out of oure cures
Pees with meschaunce and wiþ mesauentures
Þus sayd our host and let him telle his tale 
Now telleþ forþ al þough þe sompnour gale
Ne spareþ nought myn owne maister deere
Þis false þeef þe sompnour quoþ þe frere 
Had alway bawdes redy to his hond
As eny hauk to lure in engelond
Þat told him al þe secre þat þay knewe
For here acqueintaunce was not come of newe
Þay were his approwours priuely
He took himself a gret profyt þer by
His maister knew nat alway what he wan
wiþoute maundement a lewed man
He couþe sompne vp peyne of cristes curs
And þay were glad to fille wel his purs 
And make him grete festis atte nale   
And right as Iudas hadde purses smale 
And was a theef right such a þeef was he
his maister had not half his duete
he was if I schal ȝiue him his laude 
A þeef a sompnour and eek a baude 
And he had wenches at his retenue
That wheþir þat sir Robert or sir hughe
Or Iak or Rauf or whoso þat it were
That lay by hem þay told it in his eere
Thus was þe wenche and he of oon assent
And he wold fecche a feyned maundement
And sompne hem to chapitre boþe tuo
And pyle þe man and let þe wenche go
Than wold he sayn I schal frend for þy sake
Don strike þe out of oure lettres blake
  
The þar no more as in þis cas trauayle
I am þy frend þer I þe may avayle
Certeynly he knew of bribours mo
Than possible is to telle in ȝeres tuo
For in þis world nys dogge for þe bowe
Þat can an hurt deer from an hol yknowe
Bet þan þis sompnour knew a leccheour
Or auoutier or ellis a paramour
And for þat was þe fruyt of al his rent
Therfore þer on he set al his entent
And so bifel þat oones on a day
This sompnour euer wayting on his pray
Rod forth to sompne a widew and old ribibe
Feynyng a cause for he wolde bribe
And happed þat he say bifore him ryde
A gay ȝeman vnder a forest syde
A bow he bar and arwes bright and kene
He had vpon a courtepy of grene
An hat vpon his heed wiþ frenges blake
Sir quod þis sompnour heyl and wel ouertake
welcome quod he and euery good felawe
whider ridestow vnder þis grene schawe
Sayde þis ȝiman wiltow fer to day  
This sompnour answerd and sayde nay
Her faste by quod he is myn entent
To ryden for to reysen vp a rent
That longith to my lordes duete
Artow þan a bayely quod he 
He durste not for verray filth and schame
Sayn þat he was a sompnour for þe name
De par dieux quod þe ȝeman lieue broþer
Thou art a bayly  and I am another
I am vnknowen as in þis contre
Of þin acqueintance I wol praye þe
And eek of broþerheed it ȝow lest
I haue gold and siluer in my chest
  
If that þe happe come in to oure schire
Al schal be þin right as þou wolt desire
Graunt mercy quod þis sompnour by my faith 
Euerich in otheres hond his trouthe laith
For to be sworne breþeren til þay deyen
In daliaunce forþ þay ride and pleyen
This Sompnour which þat was as ful of iangles
As ful of venym ben þese weryangles
And euer enquering vpon euery þing
Broþer quod he wher now is ȝour dwellyng
Anoþer day if þat I schuld ȝow seeche
This ȝiman him answerd in softe speche
Broþer quod he fer in þe norþ contre
wher as I hope somtyme I schal þe se
Er we depart I schal þe so wel wisse
That of myn hous ne schaltow neuer misse
Now broþer quod þis sompnour I ȝow pray
Teche me whil þat we ryden by þe way
Syn þat ȝe ben a baily as am I
Som subtilte as tel me faithfully
In myn office  how þat I may wynne
And spare not for consciens or for synne 
But as my broþer tel me how do ȝe
Now by my trouthe brothir myn sayd he 
As I schal telle þe a faithful tale  
My wages ben ful streyt and eek ful smale
My lord to me is streyt and daungerous
And myn office is ful laborous
And þerfor by extorciouns I lyue
For soþ I take al þat men wil me ȝiue
Algate by sleighte or by violence
Fro ȝer to ȝer I wynne my despence
I can no better telle faithfully
Now certes quod þis sompnour so fare I
I spare not to take god it woot
But if it be to heuy or to hoot
  
what I may gete  in counseil priuely
No more consciens of þat haue I
Nere myn extorcions I might not lyuen
Ne of such iapes I wil not be schriuen
Stomak ne conscience  know I noon
I schrew þes schriftefadres euerychoon
wel be we met by god and by seint Iame
But leue broþer telle me þy name
Quod þis sompnour in þis mene while
This ȝeman gan a litel for to smyle
Broþir quod he woltow þat I þe telle
I am a feend my dwellyng is in helle
And her I ryde about my purchasyng
To wite wher men wol ȝiue me eny þing
My purchas is þeffect of al my rent
loke how þou ridest for þe same entent
To wynne good þou rekkist neuer how
Right so fare I for ryde I wolde now
vnto þe worldes ende for a pray
A quod þe sompnour benedicite what ȝe say
I wende ȝe were a ȝeman trewely
ȝe han a mannes schap as wel as I
haue ȝe a figure  þan determinate
In helle þer ȝe ben in ȝour estate 
Nay certeynly quod he þer haue we non
But whan vs likith we can make vs on
Or ellis make ȝow seme þat we ben schape  
Som tyme like a man or like an ape
Or lik aungel can I ryde or go
It is no wonder þing þough it be so
A lousy iogelour can decyue þe
And parfay ȝit  can I more craft þan he
 why quod þis sompnour ryde ȝe þan or goon
In sondry wyse and nouȝt alway in oon
For quod he we wol vs in such forme make
As most abil is  oure pray to take 
  
what makith ȝow to haue al þis labour
Ful many a cause lieue sir sompnour
Sayde þis feend  but al þing hath a tyme
Þe day is schort and it is passed prime
And ȝit ne wan I no þing in þis day
I wol entent to wynnyng if I may
And not entende oure þinges to declare 
For broþer myn þy wit is al to bare
To vnderstond al þough I told hem þe
For but þou axid  whi laboure we 
For som tyme we ben goddis instrumentes
And menes to don his comaundementes
whan þat him list vpon his creatures
In diuers act  and in diuers figures
wiþouten him we haue no might certeyn
If þat him liste  stonde þer ageyn
And som tyme at our prayer haue we leeue
Only þe body and not þe soule greue 
witnes on Iope whom we dide ful wo
And somtyme haue we might of boþe tuo
This is to say of body and soule eeke
And som tyme be we suffred for to seeke
vpon a man and doon his soule vnrest
And not his body and al is for þe best
whan he wiþstondith oure temptacioun
It is a cause of his sauacioun
Al be it so  it was nought oure entent
he schuld be sauf  but þat we wold him hent
And som tyme we · ben seruaunt vnto man  
As to therchebisschope seynt Dunstan
And to thapostolis seruaunt was I
Ȝit tel me quod þe sompnour faithfully
Make ȝe ȝow  newe bodies alway
Of elementȝ  þe fend answerde nay
Som tyme we feyne  and somtyme we ryse

And speke renably  and as fair and wel
As to þe Phitonissa dede Samuel
And ȝit wol somme say  it was not he

But oon þing warne I þe I wol not iape
Þou wilt algates wite how we ben schape
Thow schalt her afterward my broþer deere
Com wher þe nedith no þing for to leere
For thou schalt by þin oughn experience
Conne in a chayer reden of þis sentence
Bet þan virgile whils he was on lyue 
Or Daunt also  now let vs ryde blyue
For I wol holde company with þe
Til it be so þat þou forsake me
Nay quod þe sompnour þat schal nought betyde
I am a ȝiman þat knowen is ful wyde
My trouþe wol I hold as in þis caas
For þough þou be þe deuyl Sathanas
My trouþe wol I holde  to þe my broþer
As I am swore  and ech of vs to oþer
For to be trewe breþeren in þis caas
For boþe we goon abouten oure purchas
Tak þou þi part and þat men wil þe ȝyuen
And I schal myn þus may we boþe lyuen
And if eny of us  haue more þan oþer
Let him be trewe  and part it wiþ his broþer
I graunte quod þe deuel by my fay 
And wiþ þat word þay riden forth her way
And right at þentryng of a townes ende 
To which þis sompnour schope him for to wende
Thay seigh a cart that chargid was with hay  
which þat a carter drof forþ in his way 
Deep was þe way for which þe carte stood
This carter smoot and cryde as he wer wood

As ferforthly as euer wer ȝe folid
So moche wo as I haue with ȝow tholid
The deuyl haue al boþe cart  and hors and hay
This sompnour sayde her schal we se play
And ner þe feend he drough as nouȝt ne were
Ful priuely and rouned in his eere

Ne herest nought þou  what þe carter saith
hent it anoon · for he haþ ȝiuen it þe
boþe hay and caples and eek his cart parde
 Nay quod þe deuyl god wot neuer a del
It is nought his entente trustith wel
Ask it þiself if þou not trowist me
Or ellis stint a while and þou schalt se
This carter thakketh his hors vpon the croupe
And þay bygon to drawen and to stowpe
hayt now quod he ther  Ihu crist ȝow blesse
And al his hondwerk boþe more and lesse
That was wel twight myn oughne lyard boy
I pray god saue þy body and seint loy
Now is my cart out of þe sloo par de
Lo broþer quod þo feend what told I þe
Her may ȝe seen  myn owne deere broþer
The carter spak oon þing  and þought anoþer
Let vs go forth  abouten our viage

That had almost  as lief to leese hir necke 
As for to ȝiue a peny of hir good

Or I wol somone hir to oure office  
And ȝit god wot I know of hir no vice
But for þou canst not as in þis contre

And answer þer  by my procuratour
To suche þing as  men wol oppose me
Ȝis quod þis sompnour  pay anoon let se
Twelf pens to me and I þe wil acquite

My mayster hath þe profyt and not I
Com of and let me ryden hastily
Ȝif me my twelf pens I may no lenger tary
Twelf pens quod sche  now lady seinte mary
So wisly help me  out of care and synne

And whan þe deuyl herd hir curse so

Now mabely myn owne modir deere
Is þis ȝour wil in ernest þat ȝe seye
Þe deuel quod he fecche him er he deye
And panne and al but he wol him repente
Nay olde stot þat is not myn entente 
Quod þis sompnour to repente me
For eny þing þat I haue had of þe

Now broþir quod þe deuyl be not wroþ
Thy body and þis panne is myn by right

And wiþ þat word þe foule fend him hente

And god þat maked after his ymage
Mankynde saue and gyde vs alle and some
And leene þis sompnour good man to bycome
lordyngs I couþ han  told ȝow quod þe frere
had I had leysir for þis sompnour here
After þe text of crist powel and Ion
And of oþer doctours many oon
Such peynes þat our herte might agrise
Al be it so no tonge may deuyse 
Though þat I might a þousand wynter telle
The peyn of þilke cursed hous of helle
  
But for to kepe vs fro þat cursed place  
wakiþ and prayeth ihu for his grace
So kepe vs fro þe temptour Sathanas
herknith þis word  beþ war as in þis cas
The lyoun syt in his awayt alway
To slen þe Innocent if þat he may
Disposith ȝoure hertes to wiþstonde
The fend þat wolde make ȝow þral and bonde 
He may not tempte ȝow ouer ȝour might
For crist wol be ȝour champioun and knight
And prayeth þat oure sompnour him repente
Of his mys dede  er þat þe fend him hente
This sompnour in his styrop vp he stood
vpon þe Frere his herte was so wood
That lyk an aspen leef he quok for Ire
lordyngs quod he  but oon þing I desire
I ȝow biseke þat of ȝour curtesye
Syn ȝe han herd þis false frere lye
As suffrith me I may my tale telle
This frere bosteth þat he knowith helle
And god it wot  þat is litil wonder
Freres and feendes been but litel asonder
For pardy ȝe han often tyme herd telle 
how þat a frere rauyscht was to helle
In spirit ones by a visioun
And as an aungel  lad him vp and doun
To schewen him þe peynes þat þer were
In al þe place saugh he not a frere
Of oþer folk he saugh ynowe in wo
vnto þis aungel spak þis frere þo
Now sire quod he han freres such a grace
That noon of hem schal comen in þis place
Ȝis quod þis aungil many a mylioun
And vnto Sathanas he lad him doun
And now haþ sathanas saith he a tayl
Broder þan of a Carrik is þe sayl
hold vp þy tayl þou Sathanas quod he  
Schew forth þyn ars and let þe frere se
wher is þe nest of freres in þis place
And er þan half a forlong way of space
  
Right so as bees swarmen out of an hyue
Out of þe deueles ers þay gonne dryue
Twenty þousand freres on a route
And þorugh out helle swarmed al aboute
And comen as fast as þay may goon
And in his ers þay crepen euerich oon ·
he clappid his tayl agayn and lay ful stille
This frere whan he loked had his fille
Vpon þe torment of þis sory place
his spirit god restored of his grace
vnto his body agayn and he awook
But naþeles for fere ȝit he quook
So was þe deueles ers ȝit in his mynde
That is his heritage of verray kynde
God saue ȝow alle saue þis cursed frere
My proloug wol I ende in þis manere
LOrdyngs þer is  in Engelond I gesse
A mersschly lond called holdernesse
In which þer went a lymytour aboute
To preche and eek to begge it is no doubte
And so bifel it  on a day þis frere
had preched at a chirch in his manere
And specially abouen euery þing
Excited he þe poepul in his preching
To trentals and to ȝiue for goddis sake
wher that men mighten holy soules make
Ther as diuine seruys is honoured
Nought þer as it is wasted and deuoured
Neither it needeþ not for to be ȝiue
As to possessioneres þat mow lyue
Thanked be god in wele and abundaunce
Trentals sayd he delyuereth fro penaunce
her frendes soules as wel eld as ȝonge
Ȝe whanne þat þay hastily ben songe
Nought for to hold a prest iolif and gay  
he syngith not but oon masse in a day
Delyuerith out quod he þe soules
Ful hard it is wiþ fleischhok or with oules
To ben yclawed  or brend or Ibake
Now speed ȝow hastily for cristes sake
And whan þis frere had sayd al his entent
with Qui cum patre  forþ he went
whan folk in chirch had ȝiue him what hem lest
he went his way no lenger wold he rest
  
with scrip and pyked staf ytouked hye
In euery hous and gan to pore and prye
And beggyd mele or chese or ellis corn

A payr of tablis al of yuory
And a poyntel ypolischt fetisly
And wroot þe names alway as he stood
Of alle folk that ȝaf him eny good
Ascaunce þat he wolde for hem preye
Ȝif vs a busshel  whet or malt or reye
A goddes kichil or a trip of chese
Or elles what ȝow list we may not chese
A goddes halpeny or a masse peny
Or ȝif vs of ȝoure braune if ȝe haue eny
A dagoun of ȝour blanket leeue dame
Oure suster deer  lo her I write ȝour name
Bacoun or beef or such þing as we fynde
A stourdy harlot ay went hem by hynde
That was her hostis man and bar a sak
And what men ȝaf hem layd it on his bak
And whan þat he was out atte dore anoon
he planed out þe names euerychoon
That he biforn had writen in his tablis
He serued hem wiþ nyfles and wiþ fablis
Nay þer þou lixt þou sompnour sayd þe frere
Pees quod our host for cristes moder deere
Tel forþ þy tale and spare it not at al
So thriue I quod þe sompnour so I schal
So long he wente hous by hous til he  
Cam til an hous þer he was wont to be
Refresshid mor þan in an hundrid placis 
Syk lay þe housbond man whos þat þe place is 
Bedred vpon a couche lowe he lay
Deus hic quod he O thomas frend good day
Sayde þis frere al curteysly and softe 
O Thomas god ȝeld it ȝow ful ofte

And fro þe bench he drof away þe cat
And layd adoun his potent and his hat
And eek his scrip and set him soft adoun
his felaw was go walkid in þe toun
Forth with his knaue to þe ostelrye 
wher as he schop him þilke night to lye
O deere maister quod þe seeke man

And specially for þy saluacioun

And for myn oþer frendes god hem blesse 
I haue to day ben at your chirche at messe
And sayd a sermoun after my simple wit
Nought al after þe text of holy wryt
For it is hard for ȝow as I suppose
And þerfor wil I teche ȝow ay þe glose
Glosyng is a ful glorious þing certayn
For letter sleþ so as we clerkes sayn
Þer haue I taught hem to be chariteable
And spend her good  þer it is resonable
And þer I seigh our dame wher is sche

Sayde þis man  and sche wil come anoon
 Ey mayster welcome be ȝe by seint Iohn
Sayde þis wyf how fare ȝe hertily

And hir embracith in his armes narwe  
And kist hir swete  and chirkith as a sparwe

Graunt mercy dame þis haue I found alway
But of ȝour grete goodnes by ȝoure leue

These curates ben ful negligent and slowe
To grope tendurly a conscience
In schrift and preching is my diligence
Study in petres wordes and in poules
And walk and fissche cristen mennes soules
To ȝelde Ihu crist his propre rent
To spreden his word is al myn entent
Now by ȝour leue o deere sire quod sche
Chyd him right wel for seinte trinite

Though þat he haue al þat he can desire
Though I him wrye on night and make him warm
And ouer him lay my leg oþer myn arm

Othir disport of him right noon haue I

And after þat a rostyd pigges heed  
But þat I wold for me no best were deed

My spirit haþ his fostryng on þe bible

For I so frendly ȝow my counseil schewe

After his deth  I seigh him born to blisse
In myn auysioun so god me wisse 
So did our sextein  and our fermerere
That han ben trewe freres many a ȝere
Þay may now god be thanked of his lone
Maken her Iubile  and walk alloone
But vp I roos and al our couent eeke

For sire and dame trustith me right wel

And more we se of goddis secre þinges
Than borel folk alþough þat þay ben kinges

And borel folk in riches and dispence
Of mete and drink and in her ful delyt

And diuers guerdoun hadde þay þerby

And fatte his soule and make his body lene

Sufficeþ vs  þough þay ben not goode

Makith þat crist acceptith oure prayeres

Receyued he þe lawe þat was writen

In mount oreb or he had eny speche

And eek þe oþer prestes euerychoon
In to þe temple whan þay schulden goon

No drynke which þat dronke might hem make 
But þer in abstinence prey and wake

But þay ben sobre þat for þe pepul pray

Oure lord Ihu as oure lore deuysith
Ȝaf vs ensampil of fastyng and prayeres
Þerfore we mendinauntȝ we cely freres
Ben wedded to pouert and to continence
To charite · humblesse and abstinence
To persecucioun for rightwisnesse
To wepyng misericord and clennesse
And þerfor may ȝe seen þat oure prayeres

Ben to þe hihe god mor acceptable
Than ȝoures with ȝour festis at ȝour table
Fro paradis first if I schal not lye

And chast was man in paradis certeyn  
But now herk thomas  what I schal þe seyn
I ne haue no tixt of it as I suppose 
But I schal fynd it in a maner glose 
That specially our swete lord ihc
Spak þis by freres whan he sayde þus
Blessed be þay þat pouer in spirit ben
And so forþ in þe gospel ȝe may seen

Or heris þat swymmen in possessioun
Fy on her pomp and on her glotenye
And on her lewydnesse I hem defye
Me þinkith þay ben lik Iouynian

Al vinolent as botel in þe spence

whan þay for soules sayn þe psalm of dauid
lo boef þay say  Cor meum eructauit
who folwith cristes gospel and his fore
But we þat humble ben and chast and pore
werkers of goddes word and auditours
Therfor right as an hauk vpon a sours
vpspringeth in to þaer right so prayeres
Of charitabil and chaste busy freres
Maken her sours to goddis eeres tuo
Thomas thomas so mote I ryde or go
And by þat lord þat clepid is seint Iue
Ner þou oure broþer schuldestow neuer þriue
In oure chapitre pray we day and night
To crist þat he þe sende hele and might
Thy body for to welden hastily
God wot quod he þerof nought feele I 
As help me crist as I in fewe ȝeeres

Ful many a pound ȝit fare I neuer þe bet
Certeyn my good haue I almost byset
  
Far wel my gold for it is almost a go
The frere answerd  O thomas dostow so
what needith ȝow dyuerse freres seche  
what needith him þat haþ a parfyt leche 
To sechen oþir leches in þe toun
Ȝoure inconstance is ȝoure confusioun
holde ȝe þan me or oure couent
To praye for ȝow insufficient
Thomas þat iape is not worth a myte
Ȝoure malady is for we haue to lite
 A ȝiue þat couent half a quarter otes
A ȝiue þat couent four and twenty grotes
A ȝiue þat frere a peny and let him go 
Nay nay thomas it may nought be so
what is a ferthing worth depart in tuelue
lo ech þing þat is ooned in himselue
Is more strong þan whan it is toskatrid
Thomas of me þou schalt not ben yflatrid
Thow woldist haue our labour al for nought
The hihe god þat al this world hath wrought
Saith þat a werkman is worþy his hyre
Thomas nouȝt of ȝour tresor I desire
For my self but for that oure couent
To pray for ȝow is ay so diligent
And for to buylden cristes holy chirche
Thomas if ȝe wil lerne for to wirche 
Of buyldyng vp on chirches may ȝe fynde
If it be good in thomas lyf of ynde
Ȝe lye her ful of anger and of Ire
wiþ which þe deuel set ȝour hert on fuyre
And chyden her þe holy Innocent
Ȝour wyf þat is so meke and pacient 
And þerfor trow me thomas if þou list
Ne stryue nought wiþ þy wif as for þi best
And ber þis word away now by þy faith
Touchinge such þing lo þe wise man saith
  
 wiþinne þin hous be þou no lyoun
To þy subiects do noon oppressioun
Ne make þyn acqueyntis fro þe fle
And ȝit thomas eftsons I charge þe 
Be war for hir þat in þy bosom slepith  
war for þe serpent þat so priuely crepith
vnder þe gras and styngith priuely
Be war my sone and werk paciently
For twenty þousend men han lost her lyues
For stryuyng wiþ her lemmans and her wyues
Now syns ȝe han so holy and meeke a wif
what nedith ȝow thomas to make strif
Ther nys Iwis no serpent so cruel
when men trede on his tail ne half so fel
As womman is when sche haþ caught an Ire
Vengeans is þanne  al þat þay desire
Schortly may no man by rym and vers
Tellen her thoughtes þay ben so dyuers
Ire is a þing oon þe grete of seuene
Abhominable to þe god of heuene
And to himself it is destruccioun
This euery lewed vicory or parsoun
Can say how Ire engendrith homicide
Ire is in soth executour of pride
I couþe of Ire seyn so moche sorwe
My tale schulde laste til to morwe
Ire is þe grate of synne as saith þe wise
To fle þer fro ech man schuld him deuyse
And þerfor pray I god boþe day and night
An Irous man god send him litil might
It is greet harm and also gret pite
To set an Irous man in high degre
 whilom þer was an Irous potestate
As seith senek þat duryng his estaat 
vpon a day out riden knightes tuo
And as fortune wolde right as it were so
That oon of hem cam home þat oþer nouȝt
Anoon þe knight bifore the iuge is brouȝt
That sayde þus þou hast þy felaw slayn
For which I deme þe to deth certayn
  
And to anothir knight comaundid he 
Go lede him to þe deth I charge þe 
And happed as þay wente by þe weye  
Toward þe place þer he schulde deye
The knight com which men wend hadde be deed
Than þoughten þay it were þe beste reed
To lede hem boþe to þe iuge agayn
Thay sayden lord þe knight haþ not slayn
his felaw lo heer he stont hool on lyue
Ȝe schal be deed quod he so mote I þriue
That is to sayn boþe oon tuo and þre
And to þe firste knyȝt right þus spak he
I deme þe þou most algate be deed
Than þoughte þay it were þe beste rede
To lede him forþ in to a fair mede
And quod þe iuge also þou most lese þin heed
For þou art cause why þy felaw deyth
And to þe þridde felaw þus he seith
Thou hast nought doon þat I comaundid þe
And þus he let don sle hem alle þre
Irous Cambises was eek dronkelewe
And ay delited him to ben a schrewe
And so bifel a lord of his meigne
That loued vertues and eek moralite
Sayd on a day bitwix hem tuo right þus
A lord is lost if he be vicious
An Irous man is lik a frentik best
In which þer is of wisdom noon arrest
And dronkenes is eek a foul record
Of any man and namly of a lord
Ther is ful many eyȝe and many an eere
Awaytand on a lord and he not where
For goddes loue drynk more attemperelly
wyn makith man to lese wrecchedly
his mynde and eek his lymes euerichoon
The reuers schaltow seen quod he anoon
And proue it by þin owne experience
That wyn ne doþ to folk non such offence
Ther is no wyn byreueth me my wit
Of hond of foot ne of myn eyȝe sight
  
And for despyt he dronke moche more  
An hundrid part þan he had doon byfore
And right anoon þis irous cursid wrecche 
Let þis knightes sone anoon biforn him fecche
Comaundyng hem þay schuld biforn him stonde
And sodeinly he took his bowe on honde
And vp þe streng he pulled to his eere
And wiþ an arwe he slough þe child right þere
Now wheþir haue I a sikur hond or noon
Quod he is al my mynde and might agoon
hath wyn byreuyd me myn eye sight
what schuld I telle þe answer of þe knight
his sone was slayn þer is no more to say
Be war þerfor wiþ lordes how ȝe play
Syngith placebo and I schal if I can
But if it be vnto a pore man
To a pore man men schuld his vices telle
But not to a lord þey he schuld go to helle
lo Irous Cirus þilke Percien
how he destruyed þe ryuer of Gysen
For þat an hors of his was dreynt þer Inne
whan þat he wente Babiloyne to wynne
he made þat þe ryuer was so smal
Þat wommen mighte wade it ouer al
lo what sayde he þat so wel teche can
Ne be no felaw  to an irous man
Ne with no wood man walke by þe way
lest þe repent I wol no lenger say
Now thomas leue broþer leue þin Ire
Thow schalt me fynde as iust as is a squire
Thyn anger doth þe al to sore smerte
hald not þe deueles knyf alway at þyn herte
But schewe to me al þy confessioun
Nay quod þis syke man by seynt symoun
I haue ben schriuen þis day of my curate
I haue him told holly al myn estate
  
Nedith no more to speken of it saith he 
But if me list of myn humilite
Ȝif me þan of þy good to make our cloyster  
Quod he for many a muscle and many an oyster
haþ ben oure foode our Cloyster to arreyse
whan oþer men han ben ful wel at eyse
And ȝit god wot vnnethe þe foundement
Parformed is ne of oure pauyment
Is nought a tyle ȝit wiþinne our wones
By god we owe ȝit fourty pound for stones
Now help Thomas for him þat harewed helle
Or elles moote we oure bookes selle
And ȝif ȝow lakke oure predicacioun
Thanne goþ þe world al to destruccioun
For whoso wold vs fro þe world byreue
So god me saue Thomas by ȝoure leue
he wolde byreue out of þis world þe sonne
For who can teche and werken as we conne
And þis is not of litel tyme quod he
But siþþen Elye was her or ele

In charite Iþanked be oure lord
Now Thomas help for seynte charite
Adoun he sette him anoon on his kne
This sike man wex welneigh wood for Ire

Such þing as is in my possessioun
Quod he þat may I ȝeue ȝow and noon oþer
Ȝe sayn me þus how þat I am ȝour broþer
Ȝe certes quod þe frere trusteth wel
I took our dame þe letter vnder oure sel
Now wel quod he and som what schal I ȝiue
Vnto ȝour holy couent whils þat I lyue
And in þyn hond þou schalt it haue anoon
On þis condicioun and oþer noon
  
That þou depart it so my deere broþer
That euery frere haue as moche as oþer
Thy schaltow swere on þy professioun
wiþouten fraude or cauillacioun
I swere it quod þis frere vpon my faith  
And þerwith his hond in his he laith
lo her myn hond in me schal be no lak
Now þanne put þyn hond doun at my bak
Sayde þis man and grope wel byhynde
Bynethe my buttok þere schaltow fynde
A þing þat I haue hud in priuete
A þought þis frere þat schal go with me 
And doun his hond he launched to þe clifte
In hope for to fynde þer a ȝifte
And whan þis syke man felte þis frere
Aboute his tuel grope þer and heere
Amyd his hond he leet þe freere a fart
Ther is no capul drawyng in a cart
That might haue let a fart of such a soun
The frere vpstart as doth a wood lyoun
A false cherl quod he for goddes bones
This hastow in despit don for þe noones
Thou schalt abye þis fart if þat I may
his meyne which þat herd of þis affray
Com lepand In and chased out þe frere
And forth he goþ wiþ a foul angry cheere
And fat his felaw þere lay his stoor
he lokid as it were a wylde boor
And grynte with his teeþ so was he wroth
A stordy paas doun to þe court he goth
wher as þer wonyd a man of gret honour
To whom þat he was alway confessour
This worþy man was lord of þat  village
This frere com as he were in a rage
wher þat þis lord sat etyng at his bord
Vnneþe might þe frere speke a word
  
Til atte last he sayde god ȝow se
This lord gan loke and sayde benedicite
What frere Iohn what maner world is þis 
I se wel þat som þing is amys
Ȝe loke as þough þe woode were ful of þeuys
Sit doun anoon and tel me what ȝour gref is
And it schal ben amendit if þat I may  
I haue quod he had a despit to day
God ȝelde ȝow adoun in ȝoure vilage
That in þis world is noon so pore a page
That he nold haue abhominacioun
Of þat I haue receyued in ȝoure toun
And ȝet ne greuith me no þing so sore
As þat þis elde cherl wiþ lokkes hore
Blasphemed haþ our holy couent eeke
Now maister quod þis lord I ȝow biseke
No maister sir quod he but seruitour
Þough I haue had in scole such honour
God likith not þat Raby men vs calle
Neither in market neyther in ȝour large halle
No fors quod he tellith me al ȝour greef
Þis frere sayd sire an odious meschief
This day bytid is to myn ordre and to me
And so par consequens to ech degre
Of holy chirche god amend it soone
Sir quod þe lord ȝe wot what is to doone
Distempre ȝow nought ȝe ben my confessour
Ȝe ben þe salt of þerþe and sauyour
For goddes loue ȝoure pacience ȝe holde
Tel me ȝour greef and he anoon him tolde
As ȝe han herd bifore ȝe wot wel what
The lady of þat hous ay stille sat
Til sche had herd what þe frere sayde
Ey goddes moodir quod she blisful mayde

Ma dame quod he how þynke ȝow þerby

His syke heed is full of vanyte
I hold him in a maner frenesye 
Ma dame quod he Iwis I schal not lye
But I in oþir wise may be wreke
I schal defame him ouer al wher I speke
The false blasfememour þat chargid me  
To parten þat wil not departed be
To euery man yliche wiþ meschaunce
The lord sat stille as he were in a traunce
And in his hert he rollid vp and doun
How had þis cherl ymaginacioun
So schewe such a probleme to þe frere
Neuer eft er now herd I of such matiere
I trowe þe deuel put it in his mynde
In ars metrik  schal þer no man fynde
Biforn þis day of such a questioun
who schulde make a demonstracioun
That euery man schuld haue a lyk his part
As of a soun or of a sauour of a fart
O nyce proude cherl I schrew his face
lo sires quod þe lord wiþ harde grace

Ey nyce cherl god let him neuer þe
The romblyng of a fart and euery soun

And euer it wastith lyte and lyt away
Ther nys no man can deme by my fay 
If þat it were departed equally
what lo my cherl what lo how schrewedly
vnto my confessour to day he spak
I hold him certeinly demoniak
  
Now etith ȝour mete and let þe cherl go play 
Let him go honge himself on deuel way 
Now stood þe lordes squier at þe bord
That carf his mete and herde word by word
Of al þis þing which þat I of haue sayd
My lord quod he be ȝe nouȝt euel payd

To ȝow sir frere so þat ȝe be not wroth
How þat þis fart euen  departed schuld be
Among ȝour couent if I comaunded be
Tel quod þe lord and þou schalt haue anoon  
A goune cloþ by god and by seint Iohn
My lord quod he whan þat þe wedir is fair

But þat it haue his spokes alle
Twelf spokes hath a cart whel comunly
And bring me  xij  freres wit ȝe why
For þrettene is a couent as I gesse 
Ȝour noble confessour her god him blesse
Schal parfourn vp þe nombre of þis couent
Thanne schal þay knele doun by oon assent
And to euery spokes ende in þis manere
Ful sadly lay his nose schal a frere
Ȝour noble confessour þer god him saue
Schal hold his nose vpright vnder þe naue
Than schal þis churl with bely stif and tought
As eny tabor hider ben ybrought
And sette him on þe whele of þis cart
vpon þe naue and make him lete a fart
And ȝe schul seen vp peril of my lif
By verray proef þat is demonstratif
  
That equally þe soun of it wol wende 
And eek þe stynk vnto þe spokes ende
Saue þat þis worþy man ȝour confessour
By cause he is a man of gret honour
Schal haue þe firste fruyt as resoun is

As certeynly he haþ it wel deserued
he hath to day taught vs so mochil good
with preching in þe pulpit þer he stood
That I may vouche sauf I say for me
He hadde þe firste smel of fartes þre
And so wold al his couent hardily

The lord þe lady and ech man sauf þe frere
Sayde þan Iankyn spak in þis matiere
As wel as euclide or elles protholome  
Touchand þe clerk þay sayd þat subtilte
An high wyt made him speken as he spak
he nas no fool ne no demoniak 
And Iankyn haþ Iwonne a newe goune
My tale is don we ben almost at toune
SIr clerk of Oxenford our hoste sayde
Ȝe ryde as stille and coy as doþ a mayde 
were newe spoused sittyng at a bord
This day ne herd I of ȝour mouth a word
I trowe ȝe study aboute som sophime
But Salomon saith euery þing hath tyme
For goddis sake as beth of better cheere
It is no tyme for to stody hiere
Tel vs som mery tale by ȝour fay
For what man is entred vnto play
he moot nedes vnto þat play assent
But prechith not as freres doon in lent
To make vs for our olde synnes wepe
Ne þat þy tale  tale make vs for to slepe
Tel vs som mery þing of aduentures
Ȝoure termes ȝour colours and ȝour figures
keep hem in stoor til so be þat ȝe endite
high style as whan þat men to kynges write
Spekith so playn at þis tyme we ȝow pray
That we may vnderstonde þat ȝe say 
This worþy clerk benignely answerde 
Sir host quod he I am vnder ȝour ȝerde
Ȝe haue of vs as now þe gouernaunce 
And þerfor wol I do ȝow obeissaunce
  
Als fer as resoun askith hardily
I wil ȝow telle a tale which þat I
lerned at Padowe of a worþy clerk
As prouyd by his wordes and his werk
he is now deed and nayled in his chest
Now god ȝiue his soule wel good rest
Fraunces petrark þe laureat poete  
highte þis clerk whos rethorique swete
Enlumynd al ytail of poetrie
As linian did of philosophie
Or lawue or other art particulere
But deth þat wol not suffre vs duellen heere
But as it were a twyncling of an ye
hem boþe haþ slayn and alle schul dye
But forth to telle of this worþy man
That taughte me þis tale as I first bigan
I say þat he first with heigh stile enditith
Er he þe body of his tale writith
A proheme in the which descriuith he
The mounde and of Saluces þe contre
And spekith of appenyne þe hulles hye
That ben þe boundes of al west lombardye
And of mount vesulus in special
wher as þe poo out of a welle smal
Takith his firste springyng and his sours
That estward ay encresceth in his cours
To Emylward · to ferard and to venise
The which a long þing were to deuyse
And trewely as to my Iuggement
Me thinkith it a þing Impertinent
Saue þat he wold conueyen his matiere
But þis is þe tale which þat ȝe schuln heere
Ther is at þe west  ende of ytaile
Doun at þe root of vesulus þe colde
A lusty playn abundaunt of vitaile
wher many a tour and toun þou maist byholde
That foundid were in tyme of fadres olde
And many anothir delitable sight
And Saluces þis noble contray hight
A marquys whilom duellid in þat lond
As were his worþy eldris him bifore
And obeisaunt ay redy to his hond
were alle his liegis bothe lesse and more  
Thus in delyt he lyueth and hath don ȝore
Biloued and drad þurgh fauour and fortune
Boþe of his lordes and of his comune
Ther with he was as to speke of lynage
The gentileste born of lumbardye
A fair persone  and strong and ȝong of age
And ful of honour and of curtesie
Discret ynough his contre for to gye
Sauynge in som þing he was to blame
And wautier was þis ȝonge lordes name
I blame him thus that he considered nought
In tyme comyng what mighte bityde
But on his lust present was al his þought
As for to hauke and hunte on euery syde
wel neigh al oþir cures let he slyde
And eek he nolde þat was  þe worst of al
wedde no wyf for no þing þat might bifal
  
Only þat poynt his poeple bar so sore
That flokmel on a day to him þay went
And oon of hem that wisest was of lore
Or elles þat þe lord wolde best assent
That he schuld telle him what his poeple ment
Or ellis couþe he schewe wel such matiere
he to þe marquys sayd as ȝe schuln hiere
O noble marquys  ȝoure humanite
Assureth vs and ȝiueth vs hardynesse
As ofte as tyme is of necessite
That we to ȝow may telle oure heuynesse
Acceptith lord now  of ȝour necessite
That we with pitous hert vnto ȝow playne
And let ȝoure eeris my vois not disdeyne
And haue I nought to doon in þis matere
More þan anoþer man haþ in þis place 
Ȝit for as moche as ȝe my lord so deere
han alway schewed me fauour and grace
I dar þe better ask of ȝow a space 
And audience to asken oure request
And ȝe my lord to doon right as ȝow lest  
For certes lord so wel vs likith ȝow
And al ȝour werk and euer han doon þat we
Ne couþen not deuysen how
we mighte lyue more in felicite
Saue oon þing lord if þat ȝour wille be
That for to be a weddid man ȝow list
Than were ȝour peple in souereign hertes rest 
Bowith ȝour neck  vndir þat blisful ȝok
Of souereignete  nought of seruise
which þat men clepe spousail or wedlok
And thenkith lord among ȝour þoughtes wise 
  
how þat our dayes passe in sondry wyse
For þough we slepe or wake or rome aboute
Ay fleth þe tyme it wil no man abyde
And though ȝour grene ȝouþe floure as ȝit
In crepith age alway as stille as stoon
And deth manasith euery age and smyt
In ech estat for þer ascapith noon
And as certeyn as as we knowe euerychon
That we schuln deye as vncerteyn we alle
Ben of þat day þat deþ schal on vs falle
Acceptith thanne of vs þe trewe entent
That neuer ȝit refusid ȝoure hest
And we wil lord if þat ȝe wil assent
Chese ȝow a wyf in schort tyme atte lest
Born of þe gentilest and þe heighest
Of al þis lond so þat it oughte seme
honour to god  and ȝow as we can deme
Deliuer vs out of al þis busy drede
And tak a wyf fo hihe goddes sake 
For if it so bifel as god forbede
That þurgh ȝour deþ ȝour lygnage schuld aslake
And þat a straunge successour schuld take
Ȝour heritage  O  wo were vs on lyue
wherfor we pray ȝow hastily to wyue
Her meeke prayer  and her pitous chere
Made þe marquys for to han pite
Ȝe wolde quod he  myn owne poeple deere  
To þat I neuer erst þought constreigne me
I me reioysid of my liberte
That selden tyme is founde in mariage
Ther I was fre I mot ben in seruage
  
But natheles I se of ȝou þe trewe entent
And trust vpon ȝour witt and haue doon ay
wherfor of my fre wil I wil assent
To wedde me as soon as euer I may
But þer as ȝe haue profred me to day
To chese me a wyf I wol relese
That choys and pray ȝow of þat profre cesse 
For god it woot þat childer ofte been
vnlik her worthy eldris hem bifore
Bounte comeþ al of god nought of þe streen
Of which thay ben engendrid and Ibore
I trust in goddis bounte and þerfore
My mariage and myn estat and rest
I him bytake  he may doon as him lest
Let me aloon  in chesyng of my wif
That charge vpon my bak I wil endure
But I ȝow pray and charge vpon ȝour lyf
That wyf þat I take ȝe me assure 
To worschip  whil  þat hir lif may endure
In word and werk  boþe heer and euery where 
As sche an Emperoures doughter were
And forthermor þus schul ȝe swer þat ȝe
Aȝeins my chois schuln neuer grucche ne stryue
For sins I schal forgo my liberte
At ȝour request as euer mot I þriue
Ther as myn hert is set þer wil I wyue
And but ȝe wil assent in such manere
I pray spek no more of þis matiere
With hertly wil  þay sworen and assentyn
To al þis þing þer sayde no wight nay
Bysechyng him of grace er þat þay wentyn
That he wol graunten hem a certeyn day
  
Of his spousail as soone as euer he may
For ȝit alway þe peple som what dredde  
lest that the marquys wolde no wyf wedde
He graunted hem a day such as him lest
On which he wolde be weddid sicurly
And sayd he dede al þis at her requeste
And þay with humble hert ful buxomly
knelyng vpon her knees ful reuerently
him þanken alle and þus þay haue an ende
Of her entent  and hom aȝein þay wende
And her vpon he to his officeris
Comaundith for the feste to purueye
And to his priue knightes and squyeres
which charge ȝaf as him list on hem leye
And thay to his comaundement obeye 
And ech of hem doth his diligence
To doon vnto þe feste reuerence
NOught fer fro þilke place honurable
wher as this marquys schop his mariage
Ther stood a thrope of sighte delitable
In which þat pore folk of þat vilage
hadden her bestes and her herburgage 
And after her labour took her sustienaunce
After the erthe ȝaf hem abundaunce
Among this pore folk there duelt a man
which þat was holden porest of hem alle
But heighe god som tyme sende can
his grace vnto a litel oxe stalle
Ianicula men of þat throop him calle 
A doughter had he fair ynough to sight
And Crisildes þis ȝonge doughter hight
  
But for to speke of hir vertuous beaute
Than was sche oon þe fayrest vnder sonne
For porely Ifostered vp was sche
No licorous lust was in his body ronne
wel ofter of þe welle þan of þe tonne
She dronk and for sche wolde vertu please
Sche knew wel labour but noon ydel ease
But þough þis mayden tender were of age  
Ȝet in þe brest of her virginite
Ther was enclosed rype and sad corrage
And in gret reuerence and charite
Hir olde pore fader fostred sche 
A fewe scheep spynnyng on þe feld sche kept
Sche nolde not ben ydel til sche slept
And whan sche com hom sche wolde brynge
wortis or oþer herbis tymes ofte
The which sche schred and seth for hir lyuyng
And made hir bed ful hard and no þing softe
And ay sche kept hir fadres lif on lofte
with euery obeissance and diligence
That child may do to fadres reuerence
Vpon Grisildes þe pore creature
Ful ofte sithes þis marquys set his ye
As he on huntyng rood par auenture
And whan it fel he mighte hir espye
he not with wantoun lokyng of folye
his eyȝen cast vpon hir but in sad wyse
vpon hir cheer he wold him oft avise
Comendyng in his hert hir wommanhede
And eek hir vertu passyng any oþer wight
Of so ȝong age as wel in cheer as dede
For þough þe poeple haue no gret insight
  
In vertu he considereth aright
Hir bounte and desposed þat he wolde
wedde hir oonly if euer he wedde scholde
The day of weddyng cam but no wight can
Telle what womman it schulde be 
For which meruayle wondrith many a man
And sayden whan þay were in priuete
wol nought our lord ȝit leue his vanite
wol he not wedde allas allas þe while
why wol he þus himself and vs bigyle
But natheles þis marquys haþ doon make
Of gemmes set in gold and in asure
Broches and rynges for Grisildes sake 
And of hir clothing took he þe mesure  
By a mayde ylik to hir of stature
And eek of oþer ornamentes alle 
That vnto such a weddyng schulde falle 
The tyme of vndern of þe same day
Approchith þat þis weddyng schulde be 
And al þe palys put was in array
Boþe halle an chambur  ylik here degre
houses of office stuffid with plente
Ther maystow se of deynteuous vitayle
That may be founde as fer as lastith Itaile 
This real marquys really arrayd
lordes and ladyes in his compaignye
he which vnto þe feste were prayed
And of his retenu þe bachelerie
with many a soun of sondry melodye
vnto þe vilage of which I tolde
In þis array þe right way han þay holde
  
Grysild of þis god wot ful Innocent 
That for hir schapen was al þis array 
To fecche water at a welle is went
And cometh hom as soone as sche may
For wel sche had herd sayd þat ilke day
The marquys schulde wedde and if sche might
Sche wold haue seyen som what of þat sight
Sche sayd I wol with oþer maydenes stonde 
That ben my felawes  in oure dore and see 
The marquys and þerfore wol I fonde 
To don at hom as soone as it may be
The labour which þat longeth vnto me
And þanne may I at leysir hir byholde
And sche þe way in to þe castel holde 
And as sche wold ouer þe þreisshfold goon
The marquys cam and gan hir for to calle
And sche set doun her waterpot anoon
Bisides þe þreischfold of þis oxe stalle 
And doun vpon hir knees  sche gan falle
And with sad countenaunce knelith stille
Til sche had herd what was þe lordes wille  
This þoughtful marquys spak vnto þis mayde
Ful soberly and sayd in þis manere
wher is ȝour fader Grisildes he sayde
And sche with reuerence and humble cheere
Sayde lord he is al redy heere 
And in sche goth wiþouten lenger let
And to þe marquys sche hir fader fet
He by þe hond þan takith þis olde man
And sayde þus  whan he him had on syde 
Ianicula I neither may ne can
lenger þe plesauns of myn herte hyde
  
If þat ȝe vouche sauf what so betyde 
Thy doughter wil I take er þat I wende
As for my wyf vnto hir lyues ende 
Thow louest me I wot it wel certeyn
And art my faithful liege man Ibore 
And al þat likith me I dar wel sayn
It likith þe  and specially þerfore
Tel me þat poynt  as ȝe haue herd bifore
If þat þow wolt vnto þat purpos drawe 
To take me as for þy · sone in lawe
The sodeyn caas þe man astoneyd þo
That reed he wax abaischt and al quakyng
he stood vnneþe sayd he wordes mo
But oonly þis  lord quod he my willyng
Is as ȝe wol aȝenst ȝoure likyng
I wol no þing ȝe be my lord so deere
Right as ȝow list gouernith þis matiere
Ȝit wol I quod þis markys softely
That in þy chambre I and þou and sche 
haue a collacioun and wostow why
For I wol aske if it hir wille be
To be my wyf and reule hir after me
And al þis schal ben doon in þy presence
I wol nought speke out of þyn audience
And in þe chamber whil þay were aboute
her tretys which as ȝe schul after hiere
The poeple cam vnto þe hous wiþoute  
And wondrid hem in how honest manere
And tendurly sche kept hir fader deere
But outerly grisildes wonder might
For neuer erst ne saugh sche such a sight
  
No wonder is þough þat sche were astoned
To seen so gret a gest come in to þat place 
Sche neuer was to suche gestes woned
For which sche loked with ful pale face 
But schortly þis matiere forth to chace
These arn þe wordes þat þe marquys sayde 
To this benigne verray faithful mayde
Grisyld he sayde ȝe schul wel vnderstonde 
It liketh to ȝour fader and to me
That I ȝow wedde and eek it may so stonde
As I suppose ȝe wil þat it so be 
But þese demaundes aske I first quod he 
That sith it schal be doon in hasty wyse
wol ȝe assent or elles ȝow auyse 
I say þis be ȝe redy with good hert
To al my lust and þat I frely may
As me best liste  do ȝow laughe or smert
And neuer ȝe to gruch it night ne day
And eek whan I say ȝe ȝe say not nay
Neyther by word ne frownyng contenaunce
Swer þis and here swer I oure alliaunce
Wondryng vpon þis word quakyng for drede
Sche sayde lord vndigne and vnworthy
I am to thilk honour  þat ȝe me bede
But as ȝe wil ȝour self right so wol I
And here I swere þat neuer wityngly
In werk ne thought I nyl ȝow disobeye
For to be deed þough me were loth to deye
This is ynough Grisilde myn quod he 
And forth goth he wiþ a ful sobre chere
Out at þe dore and after þat cam sche
And to þe pepul he sayd in þis manere ·
  
This is my wyf quod he þat stondith heere
honoureth hir and loueth hir I ȝow pray  
who so me loueth þer is no more to say
And for þat no þing of hir olde gere
Sche schulde brynge vnto his hous he bad
That wommen schuld despoilen hir right þere
Of which þese ladyes were nought ful glad
To handle hir cloþes wherin sche was clad
But natheles þis mayde bright of hew
Fro foot to heed þay schredde han al newe
Hir heeres han þay kempt þat lay vntressed
Ful rudely and with hir fyngres smale
A coroun on hir heed þay han Idressed
And set hir ful of nowches gret and smale
Of hir array what schuld I make a tale 
Vnnethe þe poeple hir knew for hir fairnesse 
whan sche translated was in such richesse 
This marquis haþ hir spoused with a ryng
Brought for þe same cause and þan hir sette
vpon an hors snowwhyt and wel amblyng
And to his palys er he lenger lette
with ioyful poeple þat hir ladde and mette
Conueyed hire and þus þe day þay spende
In reuel til þe sonne gan descende
And schortly þis tale for to chace
I say þat to þis newe marquisesse
God hath schewed fauour and sent hir of his grace
That it semyd not by liklynesse
That sche was born and fed in rudenesse
As in a cote or in an Oxe stalle
But norischt in an emperoures halle
  
To euery wight sche waxen is so deere
And worschipful þat folk þer sche was born
And from hir burthe knew hir ȝer by ȝere
Vnneth trowed þay but dorst han sworn
That to Ianicle of which I spak biforn
Sche doughter were  for as by coniecture
Hem þought sche was anoþer creature
For þough þat euer vertuous was sche
Sche was encresed in such excellence  
Of thewes goode iset in high bounte
And so discret and fair of eloquence
So benigne and so digne of reuerence
And couþe so þe poeples hert embrace
That ech hir loueþ þat lokith in hir face
Nought oonly of Saluce in þe toun
Puplissched was þe bounte of hir name
But eek byside in many a regioun
If oon sayd wel anoþer sayd þe same
So sprad of hire heigh bounte þe fame 
That men and wommen as wel ȝong as olde
Gon to Saluce vpon hir to byholde
This walter louly  nay but really
weddid with fortunat honestete
In goddes pees lyueth ful esily
At home and outward grace ynough haþ he
And for he saugh þat vnder low degre
was ofte vertu yhid þe poeple him helde
A prudent man and þat is seint ful selde
Nought oonly þis Grisildes þurgh hit witte
Couthe al þe feet of wifly humblesse 
But eek whan þat þe tyme required it
The comun profyt couthe sche redresse
  
Ther nas discord rancour ne heuynesse 
In al þat lond þat sche ne couþe appese 
And wisly bryng hem alle in rest and ese
Though þat hir housbond absent were anoon
If gentil men or oþer of hir contre
were wroth sche wolde brynge hem at oon
So wyse and rype wordes hadde sche
And Iuggement of so gret equite
That sche from heuen sent was as men wende 
Poeple to saue and euery wrong to amende
Nought longe tyme after þat þis Grisilde
was wedded sche a douȝter haþ Ibore
Al had hir leuer han had a knaue childe
Glad was þis marquis and þe folk þerfore
For though a mayden child come al byfore   
Sche may vnto a knaue child atteigne
By liklihed and sche nys not bareigne
Ther fel as fallith many tymes mo
whan þat þis child haþ souked but a þrowe
This marquys in his herte longith so
Tempte his wyf  hir sadnesse for to knowe
That he ne might out of his herte þrowe
This meruaylous desir his wyf tassaye
Now god wot he þought hir to affraye
He had assayed hir ynough bifore
And fond hir euer good what needith it
hire to tempte  and alway more and more
Though som men prayse it for a subtil wit
But as for me I say that euel it sit
Tassay a wyf whan þat it is no neede
And putte hir in anguysch and in dreede
  
For which þis marquis wrouȝt in þis manere
he com aloone a night þer as sche lay 
wiþ sterne face and with ful trouble cheere
And sayde þus Grisild quod he þat day 
Þat I ȝow took out of ȝour pore array 
And putte ȝow in estat of heigh noblesse
Ȝe haue not þat  forgeten as I gesse 
I say Grisild þis present dignite
In which þat I haue put ȝow as I trowe
Makith ȝow not  forȝetful for to be
Þat I ȝow took in pore estat ful lowe
For eny wele ȝe moot ȝour selue knowe 
Tak heed of euery word þat I ȝow say 
Ther is no wight þat herith it but we tway 
Ȝe wot ȝour self  how ȝe comen heere
In to þis hous it is nought long ago
And þough to me þat ȝe be leef and deere
vnto my gentils ȝe be no þing so
Thay seyn to hem it is gret schame and wo
For to ben subiect  and ben in seruage 
To the þat born art of a smal village  
And namely syn þy doughter was Ibore
These wordes han þay spoken douteles
But I desire as I haue doon byfore
To lyue my lif with hem in rest and pees
I may not in þis caas be reccheles
I moot do with þy doughter for þe best
Not as I wolde but as my pepul lest
And ȝit god wot þis is ful loth to me
But naþeles wiþoute ȝoure witynge
wol I not doon  but þis wold I quod he 
That ȝe to me assent as in þis þing 
  
Schew now ȝour paciens in ȝour wirching
Þat þou me hightest and swor in ȝon village
That day þat maked was oure mariage
Whan sche had herd al þis sche nouȝt ameeuyd
Neyþer in word in cheer or countenaunce
For as it semed sche was nought agreeued
She sayde lord al lith in ȝour plesaunce
My child and I with hertly obeisaunce
Ben ȝoures al  and ȝe may saue or spille
Ȝour oughne þing  werkiþ after ȝour wille 
Ther may no þing so god my soule saue
liken to ȝow þat may displesen me
Ne I desire no þing for to haue
Ne drede for to lese saue oonly ȝe
This wil is in myn hert and ay schal be
No length of tyme or deþ may þis deface 
Ne chaunge my corrage to oþer place 
Glad was this marquis of hir answeryng
But ȝit he feyned as he were not so
Al dreery was his cheer and his lokyng
whan þat he schold out of þe Chambre go
Soon after þis a forlong way or tuo
he priuely haþ told al his entent
vnto aman  and vnto his wyf him sent
A maner Sergeant was þis priue man
The which þat faithful oft he founden hadde
In þinges grete  and eek such folk wel can  
Don execucioun in þinges badde
The lord knew wel þat he him loued and dradde
And whan þis sergeant wist his lordes wille
In to þe chamber he stalked him ful stille
  
Ma dame he sayd ȝe most forȝiue it me
Though I do þing  to which I am constreynit
Ȝe ben so wys þat ful wel knowe ȝe
Þat lordes hestes mow not ben Ifeynit
Thay mowe wel biwayl it or compleyn it
But men moot neede vnto her lust obeye
And so wol I þer is no more to seye
This child I am comaundid for to take 
And spak no more but out þe child he hent
Dispitously and gan a chiere make
As þough he wold han slayn it er he went
Grisild moot al suffer and al consent
And as a lamb sche sitteth meeke and stille 
And let þis cruel sergeant doon his wille
Suspecious was þe defame of þis man
Suspect his face suspect his word also 
Suspect þe tyme in which he þis bigan
Allas hir doughter þat she loued so
Sche wend he wold han slayen it right þo
But naþeles sche neyþer weep ne siked
Conformyng hir to þat þe marquis liked
But atte last speke sche bigan
And mekely sche to þe sergeant preyde
So as he was a worþy gentil man
That she most kisse hir child er þat it deyde
And on hir arm þis litel child sche leyde
wiþ ful sad face and gan þe child to blesse
And lullyd it and after gan it kesse 
And þus sche sayd in hir benigne vois
Far wel my child I schal þe neuer see 
But sith I þe haue marked wiþ þe croys 
Of þilke fader blessed mot þou be
  
That for vs deyde vpon a cros of tre
Thy soule litel child I him bytake  
For þis night schaltow deyen for my sake 
I trowe þat to a norice in þis caas
It had ben hard þis rewthe for to see
wel might a moder þan haue cryed allas
But naþeles so sad stedefast was sche
Þat she endured al aduersite
And to þe sergeant mekely sche sayde 
Haue her agayn ȝour litel ȝonge mayde
Goth now quod sche and doþ my lordes heste
But o þing wil I pray ȝow of ȝour grace
Þat but my lord forbede ȝow atte leste
Burieth þis litel body in som place
That bestes ne no briddes it torace 
But he no word wil to þe purpos say 
But took þe child and went vpon his way
This sergeant com vnto þis lord agayn
And of Grisildes wordes and hir cheere
He tolde poynt for poynt in schort and playn
And him presentith with his douȝter deere
Som what þis lord hath rewthe in his manere
But naþeles his purpos huld he stille 
As lordes doon whan þay woln haue her wille
And bad þe sergeaunt þat he priuely
Scholde þis childe softe wynde and wrappe 
with alle circumstaunces tendurly
And cary it in a cofre or in his lappe
Vpon peyne his heed of for to swappe
That no man schulde knowe of þis entent
Ne whens he com ne whider þat he went
  
But at Boloyne to his suster deere
That þilke tyme of panik was Countesse
He schuld it take and schewe hir þis matiere
Byseching her to doon hir busynesse
This child to fostre in alle gentilesse
And whos child þat it was he bad hir hyde
From euery wight for ought þat mighte bytyde
The sergeant goþ and haþ fulfild þis þing
But to þis marquys now retourne we  
For now goþ he ful fast ymaginyng
If by his wyues cher he mighte se
Or by hir word apparceyue þat sche
were chaunged but he hir neuer couþe fynde
But euer in oon ylike sad and kynde 
As glad as humble as busy in seruise 
And eek in loue as sche was wont to be
was sche to him in euery maner wyse 
Ne of hir doughter nouȝt o word spak sche
Non accident for noon aduersite
was seyn in hir ne neuer hir doughter name
Ne nempnyd sche in ernest ne in game
IN þis estaat þer passed ben foure ȝer
Er sche wiþ childe was but as god wolde
A knaue child sche bar by þis waltier
Ful gracious and fair for to biholde
And whan þat folk it to his fader tolde
Nouȝt oonly he but al his contre merye
was for þis child and god þay þank and herie
When it was tuo ȝer old and fro þe brest
Departed fro his noris vpon a day
This markys caughte ȝit another lest
  
To tempt his wif ȝit after if he may
O needles was sche tempted in assay
But weddid men ne knowen no mesure
whan þat þay fynde a pacient creature
Wyf quod þis marquys ȝe han herd er þis
My peple sekly berith oure mariage
And namly syn my sone yboren is
Now is it wors þan euer in al our age
The murmur sleþ myn hert and my corrage
For to myn eeris comeþ þe vois so smerte
Þat it wel neigh destroyed haþ myn herte
Now say þay þus whan wauter is a goon
Than schal þe blood of Ianicula succede
And ben our lord for oþer haue we noon·
Suche wordes saith my poeple out of drede   
wel ought I of such murmur taken heede
For certeynly I drede such sentence
Þough þay not pleynly speke in myn audience 
I wolde lyue in pees if þat I might
wher for I am disposid outrely
As I his suster seruede by night
Right so þynk I to serue him priuely
This warn I ȝou þat ȝe not sodeinly
Out of ȝour self for no þing schuld outraye
Beþ pacient and þer of I ȝow pray
I haue quod sche sayd þus and euer schal
I wol no þing ne nil no þing certayn
But as ȝow list nought greueth me at al
Though þat my doughter and my sone be slayn
At ȝour comaundement þis is to sayne
I haue no had no part of children twayne
But first syknes and after wo and payne 
  
Ȝe ben oure lord doth with ȝour owne þing
Right as ȝow list axith no red of me
For as I left at hom al my cloþing
whan I first com to ȝow right so quod sche
Left I my wille and my liberte 
And took ȝour cloþing wher for I ȝow preye
Doþ ȝoure plesaunce I wil ȝoure lust obeye
And certes if I hadde prescience
Ȝour wil to knowe er ȝe ȝoure lust me tolde
I wold it doon wiþoute negligence
But now I wot ȝour lust and what ȝe wolde
Al ȝour plesaunce ferm and stable I holde
For wist I þat my deth wold don ȝow ease
Right gladly wold I deye ȝow to please
Deth may make no comparisoun
vnto ȝour loue and whan þis marquys say
The constance of his wyf he cast a doun
His eyȝen tuo and wondrith þat sche may
In pacience suffre al þis array
And forth he goþ with drery countenaunce
But to his hert it was ful gret plesaunce  
This Igly sergeaunt in þe same wise
That he hir doughter fette right so he
Or worse if men worse can deuyse
hath hent hir sone þat ful was of beaute
And euer in oon so pacient was sche
That sche no cheere made of heuynesse
But kist hir sone and after gan him blesse
Saue þis sche prayed him if þat he mighte
her litel sone he wold in eorþe graue
His tendre lymes delicate to sight
From foules and from bestes him to saue
  
But sche noon answer of him mighte haue
he went his way as him no þing ne rought
But to Boloyne he tenderly it brought
This marquis wondreth euer þe lenger þe more
vpon hir pacience and if þat he
Ne hadde soþly knowen þer bifore
Þat parfytly hir children loued sche
he wold haue wend þat of som subtilte
And malice or of cruel corrage
That sche had suffred þis wiþ sad visage
But wel he knew þat next himself certayn
Sche loued hir children best in euery wise
But now of wommen wold I aske fayn
If þese assayes mighten not suffice
what couþe a stourdy housebonde more deuyse
To prove hir wyfhode and her stedefastnesse 
And he contynuyng euer in stourdynesse
But þer ben folk of such condicioun
That whan þay haue a certeyn purpos take
Thay can nought stynt of her entencioun
But right as þay were bounden to a stake 
Þay wil not of her firste purpos slake
Right so þis marquys fullich haþ purposed
To tempt his wyf as he was first disposed
He wayteth if by word or countenaunce
That sche to him was chaunged of corage
But neuer couþe he fynde variaunce  
Sche was ay oon in hert and in visage
And ay þe ferþer þat sche was in age 
The more trewe if þat it were possible 
Sche was to him and more penyble
  
For which it semyd þis þat of hem tuo
Þer nas but oo wil for as walter lest
The same plesaunce was hir lust also
And god by thanked al fel for þe best
Sche schewed wel for no worldly vnrest
A wyf as of hir self no þing ne scholde
wylne in effect but as hir housbond wolde
The sclaunder of walter ofte and wyde spradde
That of a cruel hert he wikkedly
For he a pore womman weddid hadde
hath morthrid boþe his children priuely
Such murmur was among hem comunly
No wonder is for to þe peples eere
Ther com no word but þat þay mortherid were 
For which wher as his peple þer byfore
had loued him wel þe sclaunder of his diffame
Made hem þat þay him hatede þerfore
To ben a mordrer is an hateful name
But naþeles for ernest or for game
he of his cruel purpos nolde stente
To tempt his wyf was set al his entente
Whan þat his doughter twelf ȝer was of age
he to þe court of Rome in suche wise
Enformed of his wille sent his message
Comaundyng hem such bulles to deuyse
As to his cruel purpos may suffise
how þat þe pope as for his peples reste
Bad him to wedde anoþer if him leste
I say he bad þay schulde countrefete
The popes bulles makyng mencioun
That he haþ leue his firste wyf to lete
As by þe popes dispensacioun
  
To stynte rancour and discencioun
Bitwix his peple and him þus sayd þe bulle  
The which þay han publisshid atte fulle 
The rude poepel as it no wonder is
wende ful wel þat it had be right so
But whan þese tydynges come to Grisildis
I deeme þat hir herte was ful wo
But sche ylike sad for euermo
Disposid was þis humble creature
Thaduersite of fortun al tendure
Abydyng euer his lust and his plesaunce
To whom þat sche was ȝiue hert and al
As to hir verray worldly suffisaunce
But schortly if I þis story telle schal
This marquys writen haþ in special
A letter in which he schewith his entent
And secrely he to Boloyne it sent 
To therl of panyk which þat hadde þo
weddid his suster prayd he specially
To brynge hom aȝein his children tuo
In honurable estaat al openly
But oon þing he him prayde outerly
That he to no wight þough men wold enquere
Schuld not tellen whos children þay were
But say þe mayde schuld Iweddid be
vnto þe markys of Saluce anoon
And as þis eorl was prayd so dede he
For at day set he on his way is goon
Toward Saluce and lordes many oon
In riche array þis mayden for to guyde
hir ȝonge broþer rydyng by hir syde
  
Arrayed was toward hir mariage
This freisshe may al ful of gemmes clere
hir broþer which þat seuen ȝer was of age
Arrayed eek ful freissh in his manere 
And thus in gret noblesse and with glad chere
Toward Saluces schapyng her iournay
Fro day to day þay ryden in her way
AMong al þis after his wikked vsage  
This marquis ȝit his wif to tempte more
To þe vttrest proef of hir corrage
Fully to han experiens and lore
If þat sche were as stedefast as byfore
He on a day in open audience
Ful boystously haþ sayd hir þis sentence
Certes Grisildes I had ynough plesaunce
To haue ȝow to my wif for ȝour goodnesse
And for ȝoure trouþe and for ȝour obeissaunce
Nought for ȝour lignage ne for ȝour richesse
But now know I in verray sothfastnesse 
That in gret lordschip if I wel auyse 
Ther is gret seruise in sondry wyse 
I may not do as euery plough man may
My poeple me constreignith for to take
Anoþer wyf and certeyn day by day
And eek þe popes rancour for to slake
Consentith it þat dar I vndertake
And trewely þus moche I wol ȝow say
My newe wif is comyng by þe way
Be strong of hert and voyde anoon hir place
And þilke dower þat ȝe broughten me
Tak it agayn I graunt it of my grace
  
Retourneth to ȝour fadres hous quod he
No man may alway haue prosperite
with euen hert I rede ȝow endure
The strok of fortune or of aduenture
And sche agayn answerd in pacience
My lord quod sche I wot and wist alway
how þat bitwixe ȝour magnificence
And my pouerte no wight can ne may
Make comparisoun it is no nay
 I ne held me neuer digne in no manere
To ben ȝour wyf ne ȝit ȝour Chamberere
And in þis hous þer ȝe me lady made 
The highe god take I for my witnesse
And al so wisly he my soule glade
I neuer huld me lady ne maistresse   
But humble seruaunt to ȝour worthinesse
And euer schal whil þat my lyf may dure
Abouen euery worldly creature
That ȝe so longe of ȝour benignite
han holden me in honour and nobleye
wher as I was not worthy for to be
That þonk I god and ȝow to whom I preye
Forȝeld it ȝow þer is more to seye
vnto my fader gladly wil I wende
And with him duelle vnto my lyues ende 
Ther I was fostred as a child ful smal
Til I be deed my lyf ther wil I lede
A widow clene in body hert and al
For sith I ȝaf to ȝow my maydenhede
And am ȝour trewe wyf it is no drede
God schilde such a lordes wyf to take
Anoþer man to housbond or to make
  
And of ȝour newe wif god of his grace
So graunte ȝow wele and prosperite
For I wol gladly ȝelden hir my place
I which þat I was blisful wont to be
For sith it liketh ȝow my lord quod sche
That whilom were al myn hertes reste
That I schal gon I wil go whan ȝow leste
But þer as ȝe profre me such dowayre 
As I ferst brought it is wel in my mynde
It were my wrecchid cloþes no þing faire
Þe whiche to me were hard now for to fynde
O goode god how gentil and how kynde
Ȝe semed by ȝour speche and ȝour visage
That day þat maked was our mariage
But soþ is sayd algate I fynd it trewe 
For in effect it proued is on me
loue is nought old as whan þat it is newe
But certes lord for noon aduersite 
To deyen in þe caas it schal not be 
Þat euer in word or werk I schal repente
That I ȝow ȝaf myn hert in hol entente  
My lord ȝe wot þat in my fadres place
Ȝe dede me strippe out of my pore wede
And richely me cladden of ȝour grace
To ȝow brought I nought elles out of drede
But faith and mekenes and maydenhede 
And her agayn my cloþyng I restore
And eek my weddyng ryng for euermore
The remenant of ȝour jewels redy be 
wiþin ȝour chambur dore dar I saufly sayn
Naked out of my fadres hous quod sche 
I com and naked moot I torne agayn
  
Al ȝour pleisauns wold I fulfille fayn
But ȝit I hope it be not ȝoure entent
That I smocles out of ȝour chambre went
Ȝe couþe not doon so dishonest a þing
Þat þilke wombe in which ȝour children leye
Schulde byforn þe poeple in my walkyng
Be seye al bare wherfore I ȝow pray
let me not lik a worm go by þe way 
Remembre ȝow myn oughne lord so deere 
I was ȝour wyf þough I vnworþy were
Wherfor in guerdoun of my maydenhede
which þat I brought and nought agayn I bere
As voucheth sauf as ȝeue me to my meede
Such a smok as I was wont to were
That I þer with may wrye þe wombe of here 
Þat was ȝour wif and here take I my leue
Of ȝow myn oughne lord lest I ȝow greue
The smok quod he þat þou hast on þy bak
let it be stille and ber it forþ wiþ þe
But wel vnnethes þilke word he spak
But went his way for routhe and for pite
Byforn þe folk hir seluen strippith sche 
And in hir smok wiþ heed and foot al bare
Toward hir fader house forth is sche fare
The folk hir folwen wepyng in hir weye
And fortune ay þay cursen as þay goon
But sche fro wepyng kept hir eyen dreye  
Ne in þis tyme word ne spak sche noon
hir fader þat þis tyding herd anoon
Cursed þe day and tyme þat nature
Schoop him to ben a lyues creature
  
For out of doute þis olde þore man
was euer in suspect of hir mariage
For euer he deemed sith þat it bigan
That whan þe lord fulfilled had his corrage
him wolde þinke þat it were disparage
To his estate  so lowe for to light
And voyden hire as sone as euer he might
Agayns his doughter hastily quod he
For he by noyse of folk knew hir comyng
And wiþ hir olde cote as it might be 
he couered hir ful sorwfully wepynge
But on hir body might he it nouȝt bringe
For rude was þe cloth  and sche mor of age
By deyes fele  þan hir mariage
Thus with hir fader for a certeyn space
Dwellith þis flour of wifly pacience
That neyther by her wordes ne by hir face
Byforn þe folk nor eek in her absence
Ne schewed sche that hir was doon offence
Ne of hir highe astaat no remembraunce
Ne hadde sche  as by hir countenaunce
No wonder is for in hir gret estate
hir gost was euer in playn humilite
Ne tender mouth noon herte delicate
Ne pompe  ne semblant of realte
But ful of pacient benignite
Discrete and prideles ay honurable 
And to hir housbond euer meke · and stable
Men speke of Iob  and most for his humblesse ·
As clerkes whan hem lust can wel endite
Namely of men  but as in sothfastnesse
Þough clerkes prayse wommen but a lite
  
Þer can no man in humblesse him acquyte
As wommen can  ne can be half so trewe  
As wommen ben  but it be falle of newe
Fro boloyne is þis erl of panik ycome
Of which þe fame vp sprong to more and lasse
And to þe poeples eeres alle and some
was couth eek þat a newe marquisesse
he wiþ him brought in such pomp and richesse
That neuer was þer seyn with mannes ye
So noble array in al west lombardye
The marquys which þat schoop and knew al þis
Er þat þis erl was come sent his message 
After þilk cely pore Grisildis
And sche wiþ humble hert and good visage
Not with so swollen hert in hir corrage
Cam at his hest  and on hir knees hir sette
And reuerently and wyfly sche him grette
Grisild quod he  my wil is outrely
This mayden þat schal weddid be to me
Receyued be to morwe as really
As it possible is in myn hous to be
And eek þat euery wight in his degre
haue his estaat in sittyng and seruyse
In high plesaunce as I can deuyse
I haue no womman suffisant certeyne
The chambres for tarray in ordinance
After my lust and þerfor wold I feyne 
That þin were al such maner gouernaunce
Thow knowest eek of al my plesaunce
Though þyn array be badde and ille byseye
Do þou þy deuer atte leste weye
  
Nought oonly lord þat I am glad quod sche 
To don ȝour lust  but I desire also 
Ȝow for to serue and plese in my degre
wiþoute feynyng and schal euer mo
Ne neuer for no wele ne for no wo
Ne schal þe gost wiþinne myn herte stente 
To loue ȝow best wiþ al my trewe entent
And wiþ þat word sche gan þe hous to dight
And tables for to sette and beddes make  
And peyned hir to doon al þat sche might
Preying þe chamberers for goddes sake
To hasten hem and faste swepe and schake
And sche þe moste seruisable of alle 
haþ euery chamber arrayed and his halle 
Abouten vndern gan þis lord alight
Þat with him brought þese noble children tweye
For which þe peple ran to se þat sight
Of her array so richely biseye
And þan at erst amonges hem þay seye
That walter was no forþ þough that him lest
To chaunge his wyf  for it was for þe best 
For sche is fairer  as þay demen alle 
Than is Grisild and more tender of age
And fairer fruyt bitwen hem schulde falle
And more plesaunt for hir high lynage
hir broþer eek  so fair was of visage
That hem to seen þe peple haþ caught plesaunce
Comending now þe marquys gouernaunce
O stormy poeple  vnsad and euer vntrewe
And vndiscret and chaungyng as a fane
Desyryng euer in rombel þat is newe
For lik þe moone ay wax ȝe and wane
  
Ay ful of clappyng dere ynough a Iane
ȝoure doom is fals ȝour constaunce yuel preuith
A ful gret fool is he that on ȝow leeuith
Thus sayde saad folk in þat Citee
whan þat þe poeple gased vp and doun
For þay were glad right of þe nouelte
To han a newe lady of her toun
No more of þis now make I mencioun
But to Grisildes agayn wol I me dresse
And telle hir constance and hir busynesse 
Ful busy was grisild in euery þing
That to þe feste was appertinent
Right nought was sche abaissht of hir cloþing
Though it were ruyde  and som del eek torent
But wiþ glad cheer to þe ȝate is sche went  
with oþer folk to griete þe marquisesse
And after þat doth forth hir busynesse 
With so glad chier his gestes sche receyueth
And so connyngly euerich in his degre 
That no defaute no man aparceyueth
But ay þay wondren what sche mighte be
That in so pouer array was for to se
And couþe such honour and reuerence
And worthily þay prayse hir prudence
In al þis mene while sche ne stent
This mayde and eek hir brother to comende
with al hir hert  in ful buxom entent
So wel þat no man couþe hir pris amende
But atte last whan þat þese lordes wende
To sitte doun to mete he gan to calle 
Grisild as sche was busy in his halle
  
Grisyld quod he as it were in his play
how likith þe my wif and hir beaute
Right wel my lord quod sche for in good fay
A fairer saugh I neuer noon þan sche
I pray to god ȝiue hir prosperite
And so hope I  þat he wol to ȝow sende
Plesaunce ynough vnto ȝour lyues ende 
On þing warn I ȝow and biseke also 
That ȝe ne prike wiþ no tormentynge
Þis tendre mayden as ȝe haue do mo
For sche is fostrid in hir norischinge
More tendrely and to my supposynge 
Sche couþe not aduersite endure
As couþe a pore fostrid creature
And whan þis walter saugh hir pacience
hir glade cheer and no malice at al
And he so oft had doon to hir offence
And sche ay sad  and constant as a wal
Continuyng euer hir Innocence oueral
This sturdy marquys gan his herte dresse
To Rewen vpon hir wyfly stedefastnesse 
This is ynough Grisilde myn quod he  
Be now no more agast ne yuel apayed
I haue thy faith and þy benignite
As wel as euer womman was assayed
In gret estate and propreliche arrayed
Now knowe I dere wyf þy stedefastnesse
And hir in armes took and gan hir kesse
And sche for wonder took of it no keepe
Sche herde not what þing he to hir sayde
Sche ferd as sche had stert out of a sleepe
Til sche out of hir masidnesse abrayde
  
Grisild quod he by god þat for vs deyde
Thou art my wyf ne noon oþer I haue
Ne neuer had as god my soule saue
This is my doughter which þou hast supposed
To be my wif þat oþer faithfully
Schal be myn heir as I haue ay purposed
Thow bar hem in þy body trewely
At Boloyne haue I kept hem priuely
Tak hem agayn for now maistow not seye
That þou hast lorn noon of þy children tweye
And folk þat oþer weyes han seyd of me
I warn hem wel þat I haue doon þis deede
For no malice ne for no cruelte
But for tassaye in þe þy wommanhede
And not to slen my children god forbede
But for to kepe hem priuely and stille
Til I þy purpos knowe and al þy wille
Whan sche þis herd a swoned doun sche fallith
For pitous ioy  and after her swownyng
Sche bothe hir ȝonge children to hir callith
And in hir armes pitously wepyng
Embraseth hem and tenderly kissyng
Ful lik a moder with hir salte teris
Sche bathis boþe hir visage and hir eeris
O such a pitous þing it was to see
hir swownyng and hir humble vois to heere
Graunt mercy lord  god thank it ȝow quod sche  
That ȝe han kept my children so deere
Now rek I neuer to be deed right heere
Sith I stond in ȝour loue and in ȝour grace
No fors of deth ne whan my spirit pace
  
O tender deere  ȝonge children myne
Ȝoure woful moder wende stedefastly
That cruel houndes or som foul vermyne
had eten ȝow but god of his mercy
And ȝour benigne fader tenderly
hath doon ȝow kept and in þat same stounde
Al sodeinly sche swapped doun to grounde 
And in hir swough so sadly holdith sche
hir children tuo  whan sche gan hem tembrace
That with gret sleight and gret difficulte
The children from her am þay gonne arace
O many a teer  o many a pitous face
Doun ran of hem þat stooden hir bisyde
Vnnethe aboute hir mighte þay abyde
Waltier hir gladith and hir sorwe slakith
Sche rysith vp abaisshed from hir traunce
And euery wight hir ioy and feste makith
Til sche hath caught agayn hir continaunce
wauter hir doth so faithfully plesaunce
That it was daynte for to see þe cheere
Bitwix hem tuo  now þay be met in feere
These ladys whan þat þay her tyme say
han taken hir and in to chambre goon
And strippen hir  out of hir rude array
And in a cloth of gold þat brighte schon
with a coroun of many a riche stoon
vpon hir heed þay in to halle hir brought
And þer sche was honoured as hir ought
Thus hath þis pitous day a blisful ende
For euery man and womman doth his might
This day in mirth and revel to despende
Til on þe welken schon þe sterres bright
  
For more solempne in euery mannes sight
This feste was and gretter of costage  
Than was þe reuel of hir mariage 
Ful many a ȝer in heigh prosperite
lyuen þese tuo in concord and in rest
And richeliche his doughter maried he
vnto a lord on of þe worthiest
Of al ytaile and þanne in pees and rest
His wyues fader in his court he kepith
Til þat þe soule out of his body crepith
His sone succedith in his heritage
In rest and pees  after his fader day
And fortunat  was eek in mariage
Al put he not his wyf in gret assay
This world is not so strong it is no nay
As it haþ ben in olde tymes ȝore
And herknith what þis auctor saith þerfore
This story is sayd nat for þat wyues scholde
Folwe Grisild  as in humilite
For it were importable þough þay wolde
But for þat euery wight in his degre
Schulde be constant  in aduersite
As was Grisild  therfore Petrark writeth
This story which wiþ high stile he enditeth
For swich a womman was so pacient
vnto a mortal man wel more vs oughte
Receyuen al in gre þat god vs sent
For gret skil is he proue þat he wroughte
But he ne temptith no man þat he boughte
As saith seint Iame if he his pistil rede
he prouith folk al day it is no drede
  
And suffrith vs as for our exercise
wiþ scharpe scourges of aduersite
Ful ofte to be bete in sondry wise
Nought for to knowe oure wille for certes he
Er we were born  knew al our frelte
And for oure best is al his gouernaunce
Leet vs þanne lyue in vertuous suffraunce
But oo word lordes herkneth er I go
It were ful hard to fynde now a dayes  
As Grisildes in al a toun þre or tuo
For if þat þay were put to such assayes
The gold of hem haþ now so badde alayes
with bras þat þough þe coyn be fair at ye
hit wolde raþer brest in tuo þan plye
For which heer for þe wyues loue of bathe
whos lyf and alle of hir secte god meyntene
In high maistry and elles were it scathe
I wil with lusty herte freisch and grene
Say ȝow a song to glade  ȝow I wene
And lat vs stynt of ernestful matiere
herknith my song  þat saith in þis manere 
GRisild is deed and eek hir pacience
And bothe at oones buried in Itayle
For whiche I crye in open audience 
No weddid man so hardy be to assayle
his wyues pacience in hope to fynde
Grisildes for in certeyn he schal fayl
  
O noble wyues ful of heigh prudence 
let noon humilite ȝour tonges nayle
Ne lat no clerk haue cause or diligence
To write of ȝow a story of such meruayle 
As of Grisildes pacience and kynde
Lest Chichiuache ȝow swolwe in hir entraile
Folwith Ecco þat holdith no silence
But euer answereth at þe countretayle
Beþ nouȝt bydaffed for ȝour Innocence
But scharply tak on ȝow þe gouernayle
Empryntith wel þis lessoun in ȝour mynde
For comun profyt sith it may auayle
Ȝe archewyues stondith at defens
Syn ȝe ben strong as is a greet Chamayle
Ne suffre not þat men ȝow don offens
And sclendre wydewes felle as in batayle
Beth egre as is a Tyger ȝond in Inde
Ay clappith as a mylle I ȝow counsaile
Ne drede hem not  do hem no reuerence  
For þough þin housbond armed be in mayle
The arwes of þy crabbid eloquence
Schal perse his brest and eek his aduentayle 
In gelousy I rede eek þou him bynde
And þou schalt make him couche as doth a quayle
If þou be fair þer folk ben in presence
Schew þou þy visage and þin apparaile
If þou be foul be fre of þy despense
To gete þe frendes do ay þy trauayle 
Be ay of chier as light as lef on lynde 
And let hem care and wepe and wryng and wayle
WEpyng and wailyng care and oþer sorwe
I knowe ynough boþe on euen and on morwe
Quod þe marchaund  and so doon oþer mo
That weddid ben I trowe þat it be so
For wel I woot it fareth so with me
I haue a wyf  þe worste þat may be
For þough þe feend to hir ycoupled were
Sche wold him ouer macche I dar wel swere
what schuld I ȝow reherse in special
hir high malice  sche is a schrewe at al
Ther is a long and a large difference
Betwix Grisildes grete pacience
And of my wyf þe passyng cruelte
were I vnbounden also mot I the
I wolde neuer eft come in þe snare
we weddid men lyue in sorwe and care
Assay whoso wil and he schal fynde 
That I say soth by seint Thomas of Inde
As for þe more part  I say not alle
God schilde þat it scholde so byfalle 
A good sir host  I haue yweddid be
Thise monthes tuo and more not par de
And ȝit I trowe he þat al his lyue
wyfles haþ ben þough þat men wold him riue
vnto þe hert ne couþe in no manere 
Tellen so moche sorwe as I now heere  
Couþe telle of my wyfes cursednesse 
No quod our ost marchaunt so god ȝow blesse
Sin ȝe so moche knowen of þat art
Ful hertily tellith vs a part
Gladly quod he of myn oughne sore
For sory hert I telle may na more
Whilom þer was duellyng in lombardy
A worþy knight þat born was of pauy
In which he lyued in gret prosperite
And fourty ȝer  a wifles man was he
And folwed ay his bodily delyt
On wommen  ther was his appetyt
As doon þese fooles þat ben seculere
And whan þat he was passed fourty ȝere
were it for holyness or for dotage
I can not say  but such a gret corrage
hadde þis knight  to ben a weddid man
That day and night  he doþ al þat he can
Taspye wher þat he mighte weddid be
Praying our lord to graunte him þat he
Might oones knowen of þat blisful lif
Þat is bitwix an housbond and his wyf
And for to lyue vnder þat holy bond
with which god first  man to womman bond
Noon oþer lif said he is worth a bene
For wedlok is so holy and so clene
That in þis world it is a paradis
Thus sayd þis olde knight þat was so wys
And certeinly as soth as god is king
To take a wyf  is a glorious þing
And namely whan a man is old and hoor
Than is a wyf þe fruyt of his tresor
Than schuld he take a ȝong wif and a fair
On which he might engendre him an hair
  
And lede his lyf in mirthe and in solace
wher as þese bachileres synge allas
whan þay fynde eny aduersite
In loue which is but childes vanite  
And trewely it sit wel to be so
That bachilers haue ofte peyne and wo
On brutil ground þay bulde brutelnesse 
Þay fynde whan þay wene sikernesse
Thay lyue but as a brid oþer as a best
In liberte and vnder noon arrest
Ther as a weddid man in his estate
lyuith his lif busily and ordinate
vnder þe ȝok of mariage Ibounde
wel may his herte in ioye and blisse abounde 
For who can be so buxom as a wyf 
who is so trewe and eek so ententyf
To kepe him seek and hool as is his make
For wele or woo sche wol him not forsake 
Sche is not wery him to loue and serue
Theigh þat he lay bedred til þat he sterue
And ȝet som clerkes seyn it is not so
Of whiche theofrast is oon of þo
what fors þough theofrast liste lye
Ne take no wif quod he for housbondrye
As for to spare in houshold þy dispense
A trewe seruaunt doth more diligence
Þy good to kepe þan þin oughne wif 
For sche wol clayme half part in al hir lif
And if þat þou be seek so god me saue
Þyne verray frendes or a trewe knaue
wol kepe þe bet· þan sche þat waytith ay
After þy good and hath doon many day
And if þat þou take a wif be war
Of oon peril which declare I ne dar
This entent and an hundrid siþe wors
writith þis Mas ther god his bones curs
  
But take no keep of al such vanite
Deffy theofrast and herkne me
A wyf is goddes ȝifte verrayly
Al oþer maner ȝiftes hardily
As landes rentes pasture or comune
Or oþer moeblis ben ȝiftes of fortune  
That passen as a schadow on a wal
But dred not if I playnly telle schal
A wyf wil last and in þin hous endure
wel lenger þan þe lust par aduenture
Mariage is a ful gret sacrament
he which haþ no wif I hold him schent
he lyueth helples and is al desolate
I speke of folk in seculer estate
And herken why I say not þis for nought
The womman is for mannes help Iwrought
The heighe god whan he had adam maked
And saugh him aloone body naked
God of his grete goodnes sayde þanne
Let vs now make an helpe to þis manne
lyk to himself and þan he made Eue
her may ȝe see and here may ȝe preue
That wyf is mannes help and his comfort
his paradis terrestre and his desport
So buxom and so vertuous is sche 
Thay mosten neede lyue in vnite
O fleisch þay ben and on blood as I gesse
haue but oon hert in wele and in distresse 
  A wyf a seinte mary benedicite
how might a man haue eny aduersite
That haþ a wyf certes I can not say
The ioye þat is betwixen hem tway
Ther may no tonge telle ne herte þink
If he be pore sche helpith him to swynk
Sche kepith his good and wastith neuer a del
And al þat her housbond list sche likith it wel
  
Sche saith nought oones nay whan he saith ȝe
Do þis saith he al redy sir saith sche
O blisful ordre o wedlok precious
Thou art so mery and ek so vertuous
And so comendid and approued eek
That euery man þat holt him worth a leek
vpon his bare knees ought al his lyf
Thanken his god þat him haþ sent a wif  
Or pray to god oon him for to sende
To be with him vnto his lyues ende 
For þan his lyf is set in sikernesse 
he may not be deceyued as I gesse 
So þat he worche after his wyfes red
Þan may be boldely bere vp his heed
Thay ben so trewe and also so wyse
For whiche if þou wolt do as þe wyse
Do alway so þe womman wol þe rede
lo how þat Iacob as þe clerkes rede
By good counseil of his moder Rebecke
Band þe kydes skyn about his sones nekke
For which his fader benesoun he wan
Lo Iudith as þe story telle can
By wys counseil sche goddes poepel kept
And slough him oliphernus whil he slept
Lo abygaille by good counseil how sche 
Sauyd hir housbond Nacab whan þat he 
Schold han ben slayn And loke after also
By good counseil deliuered out of wo
Þe poeple of god and made him mandoche
Of Assure enhaunsed for to be
Ther nys no þing  in gre superlatif
As saith Senec aboue an humble wyf
Suffre þy wyues tonge as Catoun byt
She schal comaunde and þou schalt suffre it
And ȝit sche wil obeye of curtesye
A wif is keper of þin housbondrye
  
wel may þe sike man wayle and wepe
Ther as þer is no wyf þe hous to kepe
I warne þe if wisly þou wilt wirche
loue wel þy wyf as crist doth his chirche
If þou louest þiself þou louest þy wyf 
No man hatith his fleissch but in his lif 
he fostrith it and þerfore warne I þe
Cherissh þy wif or þou schalt neuer the
housbond and wif what men iape or pleye
Of worldly folk holden þe righte weye  
Thay ben so knyt þer may noon harm bytyde
And nameliche vpon þe wyues syde
For which þis Ianuary of which I tolde
Considered hath Inwith his dayes olde 
The lusty lif the vertuous quiete
That is in mariage honyswete
 And for his frendes on a day he sent
To tellen hem theffect of his entent
wiþ face sad he haþ hem this tale told
he sayde frendes I am hoor and old
And almost god woot at my pittes brinke
vpon my soule som what most I þynke
I haue my body folily dispendid
Blessed be god that I schal be amendid
For I wil be certeyn a weddid man
And þat anoon in al þe hast I can
vnto som mayde fair and tender of age 
I pray ȝow helpith for my mariage
Al sodeynly for I wil not abyde
I wil fonde tespien on my syde
To whom I may be weddid hastily
But for als moche as ȝe ben mo than I
Ȝe schul rather such a þing aspien
Þan I and wher me lust best to allien
But oo þing warne I ȝow my frendes deere 
I wil noon old wyf haue in no manere 
  
Sche schal not passe · sixtene ȝer certayn
Old fleisch and ȝong fleisch þat wold I haue ful fayn
Bet is quod he a pyk þan a pikerell
And bet þan olde boef is tendre vel
I wil no womman twenty ȝer of age
It nys but bene straw and gret forage
And eek þese olde wydewes god it woot
Thay can so moche craft of wades boot
So moche broken harm whan þat hem list
That wiþ hem schuld I neuer lyuen in rest
For sondry scolis maken subtil clerkes
womman of many a skile half a clerk is  
But certeyn a ȝong þing may men gye
Right as men may warm wax with hondes plye
wher for I say ȝow plenerly in a clause
I wil noon old wyf han right for þat cause
For if so were I hadde so meschaunce
Þat I in hir couþe haue no plesaunce
Than schuld I lede my lyf in aduoutrie
And go streight to þe deuel whan I dye
Ne children schuld I noon vpon hir geten
Ȝet were me leuer houndes had me eten
Þan þat myn heritage schulde falle
In straunge hond and þus I telle ȝow alle
I doute not I wot þe cause why
Men scholde wedde and forþermor woot I
Ther spekith many man of mariage
That wot nomore of it þan wot my page
For whiche causes man schuld take a wyf
If he ne may not chast be by his lif
Take him a wif with gret deuocioun
By cause of lawful procreacioun
Of children to þonour of god aboue
And not oonly for paramour and for loue
And for þay schulde leccherye eschiewe
And ȝeld oure dettes whan þat it is due
  
Or for þat ilk man schulde helpen oþer
In meschief as suster schal to þe broþer
And lyue in chastite ful heuenly
But sires by ȝour leue þat am not I
For by þanked I dar make auaunt
I fele my lemys stark and suffisaunt
To doon al þat a man bilongeth vnto
I wot my selue best what I may do
 Though I be hoor I fare as doþ a tree
That blossemith er þat þe fruyt Iwaxe be
A blossemy tre is neither drye ne deed
I fele me nowher hoor but on myn heed
Myn herte and my lymes ben as greene
As laurer þurgh þe ȝeer is for to seene  
And synnes ȝe han herd al myn entent
I pray ȝow to my wille ȝe assent
Diuerse men diuersly him tolde
Of mariage many ensamples olde
Some blamed him some praised it certayn
But atte laste schortly for to sayn
As alday fallith altercacioun
Bitwixe frendes in despitesoun
Ther fel a strif bitwen his bretheren tuo
Of which þat oon was clepid Placebo
Iustinus soþly cleped was þat oþer
Placebo sayde o Ianuary broþer
Ful litel need had ȝe my lord so deere
Counseil to axe of eny þat is heere
But þat ȝe ben so ful of sapience
That ȝow ne likith for ȝour heigh prudence 
To wayue fro þe word of Salamon
This word said he vnto vs euerychoon
werk al þing by counsail þus sayd he 
And þanne schaltow nought repente þe
But þough þat Salamon speke such a word
Myn owne deere broþer and my lord
  
So wisly god bring my soule at ese and rest
I holde ȝour oughne counseil is þe best
For broþer myn of me tak þis motif
I haue now ben a court man al my lyf
And god wot þough þat I vnworþy be
I haue standen in ful gret degre
Abouten lordes in ful gret estat
Ȝit had I neuer with noon of hem debaat
I neuer hem contraried trewely
I wot wel þat my lord can more þan I
what þat he saith I hold it ferm and stable
I say þe same or elles þing semblable
A ful gret fool is eny counselour
Þat seruith any lord of high honour
Þat dar presume or oones þenken it 
That his counseil schuld passe his lordes wit  
Nay lordes ben no fooles by my fay
Ȝe haue ȝour self yspoken heer to day
So heigh sentens so holly and so wel
Þat I consente and conferme euery del
Ȝour wordes alle and ȝoure oppinioun
By god þer is no man in al þis toun
Ne in ytaile couþe better haue sayd
Crist holdith him of þis ful wel apayd
And trewely it is an heigh corrage
Of any man þat stopen is in age 
To take a ȝong wyf by my fader kyn
Ȝour herte hongith on a ioly pyn
Doth now in þis matier right as ȝow lest
For fynally I hold it for þe best
Iustinus þat ay stille sat and herde 
Right in þis wise he to placebo answerde 
Now brother myn be pacient I ȝow pray
Syns ȝe haue sayd and herknith what I say
Senec amonges oþer wordes wyse
Saith þat a man aught him wel auyse
  
To whom he ȝiueth his lond or his catel
And syns I aught auyse me right wel
To whom I ȝiue my good away fro me
wel more I aught avised for to be
To whom I ȝiue my body for alwey
I warn ȝow wel it is no childes pley
To take a wyf wiþoute avisement
Men most enquere þis is myn assent
wher sche be wys or sobre or dronkelewe
Or proud or oþer way a schrewe
A chyder or a wastour of þy good
Or riche or pore or elles man is wood
Al be it so þat no man fynde schal
Noon in þis world þat trottith hool in al
Neyther man ne best such as man can deuyse
But natheles it aught ynough suffise
wiþ any wyf if so were þat sche hadde
Mo goode thewes þan hir vices badde  
And al þis askith leyser to enquere
For god woot I haue weped many a tere
Ful priuely syns I haue had a wyf
Prayse who so wil a weddid mannes lif
Certes I fynd in it but cost and care
And obseruaunce of alle blisses bare
And ȝit god woot myn neighebours aboute
And namely of wommen many a route
Sayn þat I haue þe moste stedefast wyf 
And eek þe meekest oon þat berith lyf
But I woot best wher wryngith me my scho
Ȝe may for me right as ȝow liste do
Auysith ȝow ȝe ben a man of age
how þat ȝe entren in to mariage
And namly with a ȝong wif and a fair
By him þat made water eorþe and air
The ȝongest man þat is in al þis route
Is busy ynough to bring it wel aboute
  
To haue his wif alloone trustith me
Ȝe schul not please hir fully ȝeres þre
This is to say to doon hir ful plesaunce
A wyf axith ful many an obseruaunce
I pray ȝow þat ȝe be not euel apayd
wel quod þis Ianuary and hastow sayd
Straw for þy senec and for þy prouerbis
I coueyte nought a panyer ful of herbes
Of scole termes wiser men þan þow 
As I haue sayd assenten her right now
Vnto my purpose placebo what say ȝe
I say it is a cursed man quod he 
That lettith matrimoigne sicurly
And with þat word þay rysen vp sodeinly
And ben assented fully þat he scholde
Be weddid whan him lust and wher he wolde
The fantasy and þe curious busynesse
Fro day to day gan in þe soule impresse
Of Ianuary aboute his mariage
Many a fair schap and many a fair visage  
Ther passith þorugh his herte night by night
As who so took a mirrour polissched bright
And set it in a comun market place
Than schuld he se many a figure pace
By his mirour and in þe same wise
Gan Ianuary in his þought deuyse
Of maydens which þat duellid him bisyde
he wist not where þat he might abyde
For þough þat oon haue a beaute in hir face
Anoþer stant so in þe poeples grace
For hir sadnesse and hir benignite
That of þe poeple grettest vois had sche
And som were riche and hadde badde name
But naþeles bitwix ernest and game
he atte last appoynted him anoon
And let al oþer fro his herte goon
  
And ches hir of his oughne auctorite
For loue is blynd al day and may not se
And whan he was in to bedde brought
He purtrayed in his hert and in his þought
Hir freische beaute and hir age tendre
Hir myddel smal hir armes long and sclendre
Hir wise gouernaunce hir gentilesse 
Hir wommanly beryng and hir sadnesse
And whan þat he on hir was condescendid
him þought his chois mighte nought ben amendid
For whan þat he himself concludid hadde
Him þough ech oþer mannes wyf so badde
That impossible it were to repplie
Agayn his choys þis was his fantasie
his frendes sent he to at his instaunce
And prayed hem to doon him þat plesaunce
That hastily þay wolde to him come
he wold abrigge her labour alle and some
Nedith no more for him to gon ne ryde
he was appoynted þer he wold abyde 
Placebo cam and eek his frendes soone 
And althirfirst he bad hem alle a boone  
That noon of hem noon argumentis make 
Agayn þe purpos which þat he had take
which purpos was plesaunt to god sayd he 
And verray ground of his prosperite
He sayd þer was a mayden in þe toun
which þat of beaute hadde gret renoun
Al were it so sche were of smal degre 
Suffisith him hir trouth and hir beaute 
which mayde he sayd he wold haue to his wyf
To lede in ease and holinesse his lyf
And þanked god þat he might haue hir al
That no wight his blisse parten schal
And preyed hem to laboure in þis neede
And schapen þat he faile not to speede
  
For þan he sayd his spirit was at ease
Than is quod he no þing may me displease 
Saue oon þing prikkith in my conscience 
The which I wil reherse in ȝour presence
I haue herd sayd quod he ful ȝore ago
Ther may no man haue parfyt blisses tuo
This is to say in erthe and eek in heuene
For þough he kepe him fro þe synnes seuene 
And eek from ylk a braunche of þilke tre
Ȝit is þer so parfy felicite
And so gret ease and lust in mariage
That euer I am agast now in myn age
That I schal lede now so mery a lyf
So delicat wiþoute wo and stryf
That I schal haue myn heuen in erthe heere
For sith þat verrey heuen is bought so deere
with tribulacioun and gret penaunce
how schuld I þanne þat liue in such plesaunce
As alle wedded men doon with her wyues
Come to blisse ther crist eterne on lyue is
This is my drede and ȝe my breþeren tweye
Assoilith me þis questioun I ȝow preye
Iustinus which þat hated his folye
Answerd anoon right in his iaperie  
And for he wold his longe tale abrigge
he wolde noon auctorite alegge
But sayde sir so ther be noon obstacle
Oþer þan þis god of his high miracle
And of his mercy may so for ȝow wirche
That er ȝe haue ȝour rightes of holy chirche
Ȝe may repente of weddid mannes lyf
In which ȝe sayn þer is no wo ne stryf
And elles god forbede but he sente
A weddid man grace him to repente
wel ofte rather þan a sengle man
And þerfor sire þe beste reed I can
  
Dispaire ȝow nought but haue in ȝoure memorie
Paraduenture she may be ȝour purgatorie
Sche may be goddes mene and goddes whippe
Than schal ȝour soule vp to heuen skippe
Swyfter þan doþ an arwe out of a bowe
I hope to god her after ȝe shuln knowe
That þer nys noon so gret felicite
In mariage ne neuermor schal be
Þat ȝou schal lette of ȝour sauacioun
So þat ȝe use as skile is and resoun
The lustes of ȝour wyf attemperely
And þat ȝe please hir not to amorously
And þat ȝe kepe ȝow eek from oþer synne
My tale is doon for my witt is þynne
Beþ not agast her of my broþer deere 
But let vs waden out of þis matiere
The wif of Bathe if ȝe han vnderstonde
Of mariage which ȝe han now on honde
Declared hath ful wel in litel space
Fareth now wel god haue ȝow in his grace
And with þat word þis Iustinus and his broþer
Han tak her leue and ech of hem of oþer
And whan þay saugh þat i most needis be
Thay wroughten so by sleight and wys trete
That sche þis mayden which þat Mayus hight
As hastily as euer sche might  
Schal weddid be vnto þis Ianuarie
I trow it were to longe ȝow to tarie
If I ȝow tolde of euery scrit and bond
By which þat sche was feoffed in his lond
Or for to herken of hir riche array
But finally ycomen is þat day
That to þe chirche boþe ben þay went
For to receyue þe holy sacrement
Forth comth þe preost with stoole about his necke
And bad hir be lik Sarra and Rebecke
  
In wisdom and in trouth of mariage
And sayd his orisouns as is vsage 
And crouched hem and bad god schuld hem blesse 
And made al secur ynowgh with holinesse
Thus ben þay weddid wiþ Solempnite
And atte fest sittith he and sche
with othir worþy folk vpon the deys
Al ful of ioy and blis is that paleys
And of Instrumentz and of vitaile
The moste deinteuous of ytaile
Biforn hem stood such Instruments of soun
That Orpheus ne of Thebes Amphioun
Ne maden neuer such a melodye
At euery cours ther cam loud menstralcye
That neuer tromped Ioab for to heere
Ne he Theodomas ȝit half so cleere 
And Thebes whan the cite was in doute
Bachus þe wyn hem schenchith al aboute
And venus laughith vpon euery wight
For Ianuary was bycome hir knight
And wolde bothe assayen his corrage 
In liberte and eek in mariage
And with hir fuyrbrond in hir hond aboute
Daunceth bifore þe bryde and al þe route
And certeynly I dar right wel say þis
Imeneus þat god of weddyng is
Seigh neuer his lif so mery a weddid man
holde þy pees thow poete marcian  
That writest vs þat ilke weddyng merye
Of hir philologie and he mercurie
And of þe songes that the muses songe
To smal is boþe þy penne and eek þy tonge
For to descriue of þis mariage
whan tender ȝouthe haþ weddid stoupyng age
Ther is such mirthe þat it may not be write
Assaieth it ȝour self þan may ȝe wyte
  
If þat I lye or noon in þis mateere
Mayus þat sit with so benigne a cheere 
Hir to bihold it  semed fayerye 
Queen ester loked neuer with such an ye
On assure so meke a look haþ sche
I may not ȝow deuyse al hir beaute
But thus moche of hir beaute telle I may
That sche was lyk þe brighte morw of may
Fulfild of alle beaute and plesaunce
This Ianuary is rauyscht in a traunce
At euery tyme he lokith on hir face
But in his hert he gan hir to manace
That he þat night in armes wold hir streyne
Harder þan euer paris did Eleyne
But natheles ȝit had he gret pite
That þilke night offenden hir most he 
And þought allas o tendre creature
Now wolde god ȝe mighte wel endure
Al my corrage it is so scharp and keene
I am agast ȝe schul it not susteene
For god forbede þat I dede al my might
Now wolde god þat it were woxe night
And þat þe night wold stonden euermo
I wold þat al þis poeple were a go
And fynally he doth al his labour
As he best mighte sauyng his honour
To hast hem from þe mete in subtil wise
The tyme cam þat resoun was to ryse
And after þat men daunce and drynke fast
And spices about þe hous þay cast  
And ful of ioy and blis is euery man
Al but a squier that hight Damyan
which karf tofor þe knight ful many a day
he was so rauyssht on his lady may
That for þe verray peyne he was nigh wood
Almost he swelt and swowned as he stood
  
So sore haþ venus hurt him wiþ hir brond
As þat sche bar it daunsyng in hir hond
And to his bed he went him hastily
No more of him as at þis tyme telle I
But þer I lete him now his wo compleyne
Til freisshe may wol rewen on his peyne 
O perilous fuyr þat in þe bedstraw bredith
O famuler fo þat his seruice bedith
O seruaunt traitour false homly hewe
lyk to þe nedder in bosom vntrewe 
God schild vs alle from ȝour acqueintance 
O Ianuary dronken in plesaunce
Of mariage se how þy damyan
Thyn oughne squier and þy borne man
Entendith for to do þe vilonye 
God graunte þe þin homly fo espye
For in þis world nys worse pestilence 
Than homly foo alday in þy presence
Parfourmed haþ þe sonne his ark diourne
No lenger may þe body of him soiourne
On thorisonte as in latitude
Night with his mantel þat is derk and rude
Gan ouersprede themesperie aboute
For which departed is þe route
Fro Ianuary with þank on euery side 
hoom to her hous lustily þay ryde
wher as þay doon her þinges as hem leste
And whan þay seigh her tyme þay goon to reste 
Soone after þat þis hasty Ianuarie
wold go to bed he wold no lenger tarie
he drinkith ypocras clarre and vernage 
Of spices hote to encre his corrage  
And many a letuary had he ful fyn
Such as þe cursed monk daun Constantin
Hath writen in his book de coitu
To ete hem alle he nas no þing eschieu
  
And to his priue frendes þus sayd he
For goddes loue as soon as it may be
let voyden al þis hous in curteys wise
And þay han doon right as he wold deuyse
Men drinken and þe trauers drawe anoon
The bruyd was brought abedde as stille as stoon
And whan þe bed was with þe prest Iblessid
Out of þe chambre haþ euery wight him dressed
And Ianuary haþ fast in armes take
His freisshe may  his paradys his make
He lullith hir he kissith hir ful ofte
with þikke bristlis on his berd vnsofte
lik to þe skyn of houndfisch scharp as brere
For he was schaue al newe in his manere
He rubbith hir about hir tendre face
And sayde þus allas I mot trespace
To ȝow my spouse and ȝow gretly offende 
Er tyme come þat I wol doun descende
But naþeles considerith þis quod he
Ther nys no werkman what so euer he be
Þat may boþe werke wel and hastily
This wol be doon at leysir parfitly
It is no fors how longe þat we pleye
In trewe wedlock coupled be we tweye
And blessed be þe ȝok þat we ben Inn
For in actes we mow do no synne
A man may do no synne with his wif
Ne hurt himseluen wiþ his oughne knyf
For we han leue to play vs by þe lawe
Thus laborith he til þat þe day gan dawe
And þan he takith a sop in fyn clarre
And vpright in his bed þan sittith he
And after þat he song ful lowd and clere
And kissed his wyf and made wantoun cheere  
he was al coltissch ful of ragerye
And ful of iargoun as a flekked pye
  
The slakke skyn about his nekke slakeþ
whil þat he song so chaunteþ he and craketh
But god wot what þat may þought in hir hert 
whan sche him saugh vp sittyng in his schert
In his night cappe and with his nekke lene
Sche praysith nought his pleying worth a bene
Than sayd he þus my reste wol I take
Now day is come I may no lenger wake
And doun he layd his heed and sleep til prime
And afterward whan þat he saugh his tyme
Vp riseth Ianuary but freissche may
Holdith hir chamber vnto þe fourþe day
As vsage is of wyues for þe best
For euery labour som tyme moot haue rest
Or elles longe may he not endure
This is to say no lyues creature
Be it fissch or brid or best or man
Now wol I speke of woful damyan
That languyssh for loue as ȝe schuln here
Therfore I speke to him in þis manere
 I say O sely damyan allas
Answere to my demaunde as in þis caas
how schaltow to þy lady freissche may
Telle þy woo sche wol alway say nay
Eek if þou speke sche wol þy woo bywreye
God be þin help I can no better seye
This seke damyan in venus fuyr
So brennith þat he deyeth for desir
For which he put his lyf in aduenture
No lenger might he in þis wo endure
But priuely a penner gan he borwe
And in a letter wrot he al his sorwe
In maner of a compleynt or of a lay
vnto his faire freissche lady may
And in a purs of silk heng on his schert
he haþ it put and layd it at his hert    
 The moone þat anoon was þilke day
That Ianuary had weddid freische may
In tuo of taure was in to Cancre gliden
So long hath mayus in hir chambre abiden
As custom is vnto þese nobles alle
A bryde schal not eten in þe halle
Til dayes foure or þre dayes atte lest
Ipassed ben þan let hir go to þe fest
The fourthe day complet fro noon to noon
whan þat þe heighe masse was Idoon
In halle sitte þis Ianuary and may
As freissch as is þe brighte someres day
And so bifelle þat þis goode man
Remembrid him vpon þis Damyan
And sayde seinte mary how may þis be
That Damyan entendith not to me
Is he ay seek or how may þis bityde
his squiers which þat stoode þer bisyde
Excusid him by cause of his syknesse
which letted him to doon his busynesse
Noon oþer cause mighte make him tarie
That me forthinkith quod þis Ianuarie
he is a gentil squyer by my trouþe
If þat he deyde it were harm and routhe
he is as wys discret and eek secre
As any man I wot of his degre
And þerto manerly and seruysable
And for to be a thrifty man right able
But after mete as soon as euer I may
I wol myself visit him and eek may
To doom him al þe comfort þat I can
And for þat word him blessed euery man
That of his bounte and his gentilesse
he wolde so comfort in seekenesse
his squyer for it was a gentil deede
Dame quod þis Ianuary tak good heede
  
At aftermete ȝe wiþ ȝour wommen alle 
whan ȝe han ben in chambre out of þis halle  
That alle ȝe goo to se þis Damyan
Doth him desport he is a gentil man
And tellith him þat I wil him visite
Haue I no þing but rested me a lyte 
And spedith ȝow faste for I wol abyde
Til þat ȝe slepe faste by my syde
And with þat word he gan vnto him calle
A squier þat was marchal of his halle
And told him certeyn þinges what he wolde
This freissche may hath streight hir wey Iholde
wiþ alle hir wommen vnto Damyan
Doun by þe beddes syde sat sche þan
Comfortyng him as goodly as sche may
This damyan whan þat his tyme he say
In secre wise his purs and eek his bille 
In which þat he Iwriten had his wille
Haþ put in to hir hond wiþouten more
Saue þat he siketh wonder deepe and sore
And softely to hir right þus sayd he 
Mercy and þat ȝe not discouer me
For I am deed if þat þis þing discouered be
Þis purs in hir bosom hud had sche
And went hir way ȝe gete no more of me
But vnto Ianuary comen is sche
Þat on his beddes syde sit ful softe 
And takith hir and kissith hir ful ofte 
And layd him doun to slepe and þat anoon
Sche feyned hir as þat sche moste goon ·
Ther as ȝe woot þat euery wight moot neede
And whan sche of þis bille haþ taken heede 
Sche rent i al to cloutes atte laste
And in to þe priuy softely it cast
who studieth now but faire freissche may
Adoun by olde Ianuary sche lay
  
That slepith til þat þe coughe haþ him awaked
Anoon he prayde stripen hir al naked
he wold of hir he sayd haue som plesaunce
hir clothis dede him he sayde som grevaunce  
And sche obeieth be hir lief or loth
But lest that precious folk be with me wroth
how þat he wroughte I dar not telle
Or wheþir it semed him paradys or helle
But here I lete hem werken in her wise
Til euensong rong and þan þay most arise
wheþir it be by desteny or aduenture
were it by influence or by nature
Or by constellacioun þat in such estate
The heuen stood þat tyme fortunate
As for to putte a bulle of venus werkis
For alle þing hath tyme as seyn þese clerkis
To eny womman for to gete hir loue
I can not say but grete god aboue 
Þat knowith þat noon acte is causeles
He deme of al for I wil holde my pees
But soth is þis how þat þis freisshe may
hath take such impressioun þat day
Of pite of þis sike damyan
That from hir herte sche ne dryue can
The remembraunce for to doon him ease 
Certeyn þought sche whom þat þis þing displease
I rekke not for her I him assure
To loue him best of eny creature 
Though he no more hadde þan his scherte
Lo pite renneth soone in gentil herte
heer may ȝe see how excellent fraunchise
In womman is whan þay narow hem auyse
Som tyraunt is as þer ben many oon
That haþ an hert as hard as is a stoon
which wold han lete steruen in þe place
wel rather þan han graunted him her grace
  
And hem reioysen in her cruel pride
And rekken nouȝt to ben an homicide
 This gentil may fulfillid of pite
Right of hir hond a letter maked sche 
In which sche grauntith him hir verray grace
Ther lakkid nought but oonly day and place  
wher þat sche might vnto his lust suffise
For it schal be right as he wol deuyse
And whan sche saugh hir tyme vpon a day
To visite þis damyan goþ May
And subtilly þis lettre doun sche thruste
Vnder his pylow rede it if him luste
Sche takith him by þe hond and hard him twiste
So secrely þat no wight of hit wiste
And bad him be al hool and forþ sche wente
To Ianuary whan þat he for hir sente
vp ryseth Damyan þe nexte morwe
Al passed was his siknes and his sorwe 
He kembith him he pruneth him and pyketh
he doth al þat vnto his lady likith
And eek to Ianuary he goth as lowe 
As euer did a dogge for þe bowe 
He is so plesaunt vnto euery man
For craft is al who so þat do it can
That euery wight is fayn to speke him good
And fully in his lady grace he stood
Thus lete I damyan about his neede
And in my tale forth I wol procede
Some clerkes holden þat felicite
Stant in delit and þerfor certeyn he
This noble Ianuary with al his might
In honest wise as longith to a knight
Schop him to lyue ful deliciously
his housyng his array as honestly
To his degre was maked as a kynges
Amonges oþer of his honest þinges
  
he made a gardyn walled al wiþ stoon
So fair a Gardyn wot I no wher noon
For out of doute I verrely suppose
That he þat wroot þe romauns of þe Rose
Ne couþe of hit þe beaute wel deuyse
Ne Pirapus ne might not wel suffise
Though he be god of gardyns for to telle 
The beaute of þe gardyn and þe welle  
That stood vnder a laurer alway greene
Ful ofte tyme he pluto and his queene
Preserpina and al þe fayerie
Desporten hem and maken melodye
Aboute þat welle and daunced as men tolde
This noble knight þis Ianuary þe olde
Such deynte haþ in it to walk and pleye
That he wold no wight suffre bere þe keye
Saue he himself for of þe smale wyket
he bar alway of siluer a smal cliket
wiþ which whan þat him list he it vnschette
And whan he wolde pay his wyf hir dette 
In somer sesoun þider wold he go
And may his wyf and no wight but þay tuo
And þinges which þat weren not doon in bedde
he in þe gardyn parformed hem and spedde
And in þis wise many a mery day
lyued þis Ianuary and freische may
But worldly ioye may not alway endure
To Ianuary ne to no creature
 O sodeyn hap O þou fortune vnstable
lyk to þe scorpioun so desceyuable
Þat flaterest with þin heed whan þou wilt stynge
Thy tayl is deþ þurgh þin enuenymynge
O britel ioye o sweete venym queynte
O monster þat so subtily canst peynte
Thyn ȝiftes vnder hiew of stedfastnesse
That þou desceyuest boþe more and lesse 
  
why hastow Ianuary þus deceyued
That haddist him for þy fulle frend receyued
And now þou hast byreft him boþe his yen
For sorw of which desireth he to dyen
Allas þis noble Ianuary fre
Amyd his lust and his prosperite
Is woxe blynd and þat al sodeynly
he wepith and he weyleth pitously
And þer with al þe fuyr of Ialousye
lest þat his wif schuld falle in som folye  
So brent his herte þat he wolde fayn
That som man boþe hir and him had slayn
For neyþer after his deth nor in his lyf
Ne wold he þat sche were loue ne wyf
But euer lyue as wydow in clothes blake 
Soul as þe turtil þat lost haþ hir make
But atte last after a moneth or tweye
his sorwe gan aswage soþ to seye
For whan he wist it may noon oþer be 
he paciently took his aduersite
Saue out of doute he may not forgoon
That he nas Ialous euermore in oon
which Ialousie it was so outrageous
That neyþer in halle ne in noon oþer hous
Ne in noon oþer place neuer þe mo
he nolde suffre hir to ryde or go
But if þat he had hond on hir alway
For which ful ofte wepeth freische may
That loueth Damyan so benignely
That sche moot outher deyen sodeinly
Or elles sche moot han him as hir lest
She waytith whan hir herte wolde brest
vpon þat oþer syde Damyan
Bicomen is þe sorwfulleste man
That euer was for neyther night ne day
Ne might he speke a word wiþ fressche may
  
As to his purpos of no such matiere
But if þat Ianuary most it heere
That had an hond vpon hir euermo
But naþeles by writyng to and fro
And priue signes wist he what sche ment
And sche knew eek þe fyn of his entent
 O Ianuary what might it þe auaile
If þou might see as fer as schippes saile
For as good is blynd deceyued be 
As to be deceyued whan a man may see
Lo argus which þat had an hundred eyen
For al þat euer he couþe poure or prien  
Ȝet was he blent as god wot so ben moo
That weneth wisly þat it be nought so
Passe ouer is an ease I say no more
This freissche may þat I spak of so ȝore
In warm wex hath emprynted þe cliket
That Ianuary bar of þe smale wiket
with which in to his gardyn ofte he went
And damyan þat knew al his entent
The cliket counterfeted priuely
Ther nys no more to say but hastily
Som wonder by þis cliket schal betyde
which ȝe schal heeren if ȝe wol abyde
 O noble Ouyde wel soth saistow god woot
what sleight is it þough it be long and hoot
That he nyl fynd it out in som manere
By Piramus and Thesbe may men leere
Though þay were kept ful longe streyt ouer al
Thay ben accorded rownyng þurgh a wal
Ther no wight couþe han found out swich a sleight
But now to purpos er þat dayes eyght
were passid er þe moneth of Iuyl bifille
That Ianuary haþ caught so gret a wille
Thorugh eggyng of his wyf him for to pleye
In his gardyn and no wight but we tweye
  
That in a morwe vnto þis may saith he 
Rys vp my wif  my loue  my lady fre 
The turtlis vois  is herd my douue swete
The wynter is goon  with his raynes wete
Come forth now with  þin eyȝen columbine
how fairer ben þy brestes þan is þe wyne
The gardyn is enclosed al aboute
Com forth my swete spouse out of doute
Thow hast me wounded in myn hert o wyf
No spot of þe knew I in al my lif 
Com forth and let vs  take oure desport 
I ches þe for my wyf and my comfort
Such olde lewed wordes vsed he 
On damyan a signe made sche  
That he schuld go  biforn with his cliket
This damyan þan haþ opened þe wiket
And in he stert and þat in such manere 
That no wight  it mighte see nor heere
And stille he seet vnder a bussch anoon
This Ianuary is blynd as is a stoon
with Mayus in his hond and no wight mo
In to his freische gardyn is ago
And clappid to þe wiket sodeinly
Now wyf quod he her nys but ȝe and I
þat art þe creature þat I best loue
For by þat lord þat sit in heuen aboue
leuer ich had to dyen on a knyf
Than þe offende deere trewe wyf
For goddes sake þenk how I þe chees
Nought for no coueytise douteles
But oonly for þe loue I had to þe
And þough þat I be old and may not se
Beeth trewe to me and I wol telle ȝow why
Thre þinges certes schul ȝe wynne þer by
First loue of crist and to ȝour self honour
And al myn heritage toun and tour
  
I ȝiue it ȝow makith chartres as ȝow leste
This schal ben doon to morw er sonne reste
So wisly god my soule bringe in blisse
I pray ȝow first in couenaunt ȝe me kisse
And þough þat I be ialous wyt me nought
Ȝe ben so deep emprinted in my þought
Þat whan þat I considre ȝour beaute
And þer wiþ al þe vnlikly eelde of me
I may nought certes þough I schulde dye
Forbere to ben out of ȝour companye
For verray loue þis is wiþouten doute
Now kisse me wyf and let vs Rome aboute
This freissche may whan sche his worde herde
Benignely to Ianuary answerde 
But first and forward sche bigan to wepe
I haue quod sche a soule for to kepe  
As wel as ȝe and also myn honour
And of my wifhod þilke tendre flour
which þat I haue ensured in ȝour hond
whan þat þe prest to ȝow my body bond
wherfor I wil answer in þis manere
By þe leue of ȝow my lord so deere
I pray to god þat neuer dawe þe day
That I ne sterue as foule as womman may
If euer I do to my kyn þat schame
Or elles I empaire so my name
That I be fals and if I do þat lak
Doth strepe me and put me in a sak
And in þe nexte ryuer do me drenche
I am a gentil womman and no wenche
why speke ȝe thus  but men ben euer vntrewe
And wommen han reproef of ȝow euer newe
Ȝe haue noon oþer contenaunce I leue 
But speke to vs of vntrust and repreue
And with þat word sche saugh wher damyan
Sat in þe buissh and coughen sche bigan
  
And wiþ hir fyngres signes made sche
That damyan schuld clymb vpon a tre
That charged was with fruyt and vp he went
For verrayly he knew al hir entent
And euery signe þat sche couthe make
wel bet þan Ianuary hir oughne make
For in a letter sche had told him al
Of þis matier how he worche shal
And þus I lete him sitte vpon þe pirie
And Ianuary and may romynge mirye
 Bright was þe day and bliew þe firmament
Phebus haþ of gold his stremes doun Isent
To gladen euery flour with his warmnesse
he was þat tyme in gemmes as I gesse
But litel fro his declinacioun
Of Caker  Ioues exaltacioun
And so bifel þat brighte morwen tyde
That in þat gardyn in þe ferther syde   
Pluto that is kyng of fayerye
And many a lady in his compaignie
Folwyng his wif þe queene preserpine
Ech after oþer  as right as a lyne
whil þat sche gadred floures in þe mede
In claudian ȝe may þe story rede
how in þis grisly carte he hir fette
This king of fayry þan adoun him sette 
vpon a bench of turues freissh and greene
And right anoon þus sayd he to his queene 
 My wyf quod he þer may no wight say nay
Thexperiens so preueth euery day
The tresoun which þat womman doth to man
Ten hundrid þousand  tellen I can
Notable of ȝour vntrouth and brutelnesse
O  Salamon wys and richest of richesse 
Fulfild of Sapiens  and of worldly glorie 
Ful worþy ben þy wordes to memorie
  
To euery wight þat wit and resoun can
Thus praysith he ȝit þe bounte of man
Among a þousand men ȝit fond I oon
But of wommen alle fond I noon
Thus saith þe king þat knoweth ȝour wikkednesse
And Ihc filius Sirac  as I gesse 
Ne spekith of ȝow but selde reuerence
A wilde fuyr and corrupt pestilence
So falle vpon ȝour bodies ȝit to night
Ne se ȝe not þis honurable knight
By cause allas þat he is blynd and old
his owne man schal make him cokewold
loo wher he sitt  þe lecchour in þe tre
Now wol I graunten of my maieste 
Unto þis olde blinde worþy knight
Þat he schal haue aȝein his eyȝen sight
whan þat his wyf wol do him vilonye
Than schal he knowe al her harlotrye
Boþe in reproef of her and oþer mo
Ȝe schal quod preserpine and wol ȝe so  
Now by my modres sires soule I swere
That I schal ȝiue hir suffisaunt answere 
And alle wommen after for hir sake
That þough þay be in any gult Itake
with face bold þay schul hemself excuse
And bere hem doun þat wolde hem accuse
For lak of answer noon of hem schal dyen
Al had a man seyn a þing wiþ boþe his yen
Ȝit schul we wymmen visage it hardily
And wepe and swere and chide subtilly
So þat ȝe men schul ben as lewed as gees
what rekkith me of ȝour auctoritees
I wot wel þat þis Iew þis Salamon
Fond of vs wommen fooles many oon
But þough he ne fond no good womman
Ȝet haþ þer founde many anoþer man
  
wommen ful trewe  ful good and vertuous
witnesse on hem þat duelle in cristes hous
with martirdom þay proued her constaunce
The romayn gestes eek make remembraunce
Of many a verray trewe wyf also ·
But sire be nought wrath al be it so
Though þat he sayd he fond no good womman
I pray ȝow tak þe sentens of þe man
he mente þus þat in souereign bounte
Nis noon but god þat sit in trinite
Ey for verrey god þat nys but oon
what make ȝe so moche of Salamon
what þough he made a temple goddes hous
what þough he were riche and glorious
So made he eek a temple of fals godis
How might he do a þing þat more forbod is
Par de als fair as ȝe his name emplastre
he was a lecchour and an ydolastre
And in his eelde he verraily god forsook
And if god ne had as saiþ þe book
Ispared him for his fadres sake he scholde
Haue left his regne raþer þan he wolde  
I sette right nought of þe vilonye
That ȝe of wommen write a boterflie
I am a womman needes most I speke
Or elles swelle til myn herte breke
For syn sche sayd þat we ben iangleresses
As euer hool I moote brouke my tresses
I schal not spare for no curtesye 
To speke him harm þat wold vs vilonye
Dame quod þis pluto be no lenger wroth
I ȝiue it vp but sith I swere myn oth
That I wil graunte him his sight agein
My word schal stonde I warne ȝow certeyn
I am a kyng it sit me nought to lye
And I quod sche a queen of faierie
  
hir answer schal sche haue I vndertake
Let vs no mo wordes herof make
For soth I wol no lenger ȝow contrarie
  Now let vs turne agayn to Ianuarye
That in þis gardyn with þis faire may
Syngeþ ful merier þan þe papiniay
Ȝow loue I best and schal and oþer noon
So long about þe aleys is he goon
Til he was come agaynes þilke pirie
wher as þis damyan sittith ful mirye
On heigh among þe freische leeuys greene
This freissche may þat is so bright and scheene
Gan for to syke and sayd allas my syde
Now sir quod sche for ought þat may bityde
I most han of þe peres þat I see
Or I moot dye so sore longith me
To eten of þe smale peris greene
Help for hir loue þat is of heuen queene
I telle ȝow wel a womman in my plyt
May haue to fruyt so gret an appetyt
Þat sche may deyen  but sche it haue
Allas quod he þat I nad heer a knaue
That couthe clymbe allas allas quod he
For I am blynd  ȝe sire no fors quod sche  
But wolde ȝe vouche sauf for goddes sake
The piry inwith ȝour armes for to take
For wel I woot þat ȝe mystruste me
Than schold I clymbe wel ynough quod sche
So I my foot might set vpon ȝour bak
Certes quod he þer on schal be no lak
Might I ȝow helpe wiþ myn herte blood
he stoupith doun and on his bak sche stood
And caught hir by a twist and vp sche goth
ladys I pray ȝow þat ȝe be not wroþ
I can not glose I am a rude man
And sodeinly anoon þis damyan
  
Gan pullen vp þe smok and in he throng
And whan þat pluto saugh þis grete wrong
To Ianuary he ȝaf his sight agayn
    
    
Ne was þer neuer man of þing so fayn
But on his wif his þought was euermo
Vp to þe tree he kest his eyȝen tuo 
And seigh þat damyan his wyf had dressid
In which maner it may not ben expressid
But if I wolde speke vncurteisly
And vp he ȝaf a roryng and a cry
As doth þe moder whan þe child schal dye
Out help allas harrow he gan to crie
O stronge lady stoure what dos þow
And sche answerith sire what eylith ȝow

I haue ȝow holpen on boþe ȝour eyen blynde
vp peril of my soule I schal not lyen
As me was taught to hele with ȝour yen
was noþing bet for to make ȝow see
Than stroggle wiþ a man vpon a tree
God woot I dede it in ful good entent
Stroggle quod he ȝe algat in it went
God ȝiue ȝow boþe on schames deth to dyen
He swyued þe I saugh it wiþ myn yen
And elles be I honged by þe hals
Than is quod sche medicine fals  
For certeynly if þat ȝe mighten see
Ȝe wold not say tho wordes vnto me
Ȝe han som glymsyng and no parfyt sight
I se quod he as wel as euer I might
Thankid be god wiþ boþe myn yen tuo
And by my trouth me þought he did þe so
Ȝe mase mase goode sire quod sche
This þank haue I for I haue maad ȝow see
  
Allas quod sche þat euer I was so kynde
Now dame quod he let al passe out of mynde
Com doun my leef and if I haue myssayd
God help me so as I am euel appayd
But by my fader soule I wende haue seyn
how þat þis damyan had by þe leyn
And þat þy smok had layn vpon þy brest
Ȝe sire quod sche ȝe may wene as ȝow lest
But sire a man þat wakith out of his slep
He may not sodeynly wel take keep
vpon a þing ne seen it parfytly
Til þat he be adawed verrayly
Right so a man þat long haþ blynd Ibe
Ne may not sodeynly so wel Ise
First whan þe sight is newe comen agayn
As he þat haþ a day or tuo Isayn
Til þat ȝour sight ystablid be a while
Þer may ful many a sighte ȝow bigile
Beþ war I pray ȝow for by heuen king
Ful many man wenith for to se a þing
And it is al anoþer þan it semeth
he þat mys conceyueth he mys demeth
And wiþ þat word sche leep doun fro þe tre
This Ianuary who is glad but he
he kissith hir and clippith hir ful ofte
And on hir wombe he strokith hir ful ofte
And to his paleys hom he hath hir lad
Now goode men I pray ȝow to be glad
Thus endith her my tale of Ianuarye
God blesse vs and his moder seinte marie  AmeN  
Ey goddes mercy sayd our hoste þo
Now such a wyf I pray god keep me fro
lo whiche sleightes and subtilitees
In wommen ben for ay as busy as bees
Ben þay vs seely men for to desceyue
And from a soth euer wol þay weyue
By this marchaundes tale it proueth wel
But douteles as trewe as eny steel
I haue a wyf þough þat sche pore be
But of hir tonge a labbyng schrewe is sche
And ȝit sche hath an heep of vices mo
Therof no fors let alle such þinges go
But wite ȝe what in counseil be it seyd
Me rewith sore I am vnto hir teyd
And if I scholde reken euery vice
which þat sche hath Iwis I were to nyce
And cause why it schuld reported be
And told to hir of som of þis meyne
Of whom it needith not for to declare
Syn wommen connen oute such chaffare
And eek my witte suffisith nought þerto
To tellen al wherfor my tale is do
 Sir Squier com forþ  if þat ȝour wille be
And say vs a tale for certes ȝe
Connen þeron as moche as ony man
 Nay sire quod he  but I wil say as I can
wiþ herty wil  for I wil not rebelle
Against ȝour wille  a tale wil I telle
Haue me excused if þat I speke amys
My wil is good  and þerto my tale is this
AT Sarray in þe lond of Tartary  
Ther dwelled a kyng þat werryed russy
Thurgh which þer deyed many a doughty man
This nobil kyng was cleped Cambynskan
which in his tyme was of so gret renoun
That þer nas nowher in no regioun
So excellent a lord in alle þing 
Him lakked nought þat longed to a kyng
As of þe secte of which þat he was born
he kept his lawe  to which he was sworn
And þerto he was hardy wys and riche 
And pitous and Iust alway yliche
Soth of his word benign and honurable
Of his corage as eny centre stable
Ȝong freisch and strong in armes desirous
As eny bachiler of al his hous
A fair person he was and fortunat
And kepte so wel his real astat
That þer was no wher such a ryal man
This noble kyng þis tartre þis Cambynskan
hadde tuo sones by Elcheta his wyf
Of which þe eldest highte Algaryf
That oþer was Icleped Samballo
A doughter had þis worthi king also
That ȝongest was and highte Canace
But for to telle ȝou al hir beaute
It lith not on my tong ne my connyng
I dar nouȝt vndertake so heigh a þing
  
Myn englissh eek is insufficient
he moste be a Rethor excellent
That couþ his colours longyng for þat art
If he schold hir discryue in eny part
I am non such I mot speke as I can
And so bifel it þat þis Cambynskan
haþ twenty wynter born his dyademe
As he was wont fro ȝer to ȝer I deme
he leet þe fest of his natiuite
Don cryen þurgh Sarray his Cite
The last Idus of march after þe ȝeer  
Phebus þe sonne was Ioly and cleer
For he was neigh his exaltacioun
In marcȝ face and in his mansioun
In aries þe colerik þe hote signe
Ful lusty was the wedir and benigne
For which þe foules aȝein þe sonne scheene
what for þe sesoun and for þe ȝonge greene
Ful lowde song in here affecciouns
hem semed haue geten hem protecciouns
Aȝens þe swerd of wynter kene and cold
This Cambynskan of which I haue told
In royal vesture sittyng on his deys
with dyadem ful heigh in his paleys
And held his fest  solempne and so riche
That in þis worlde was þer noon it liche
Of which if I schal tellen al þarray
Than wold it occupie a someres day
And eek it neediþ nouȝt for to deuyse
At euery cours þe ordre and þe seruyse
I wol nat tellen of her straunge sewes
Ne of her swannes ne here herounsewes
Ek in þat lond as tellen knightes olde
Ther is som mete þat is ful deynte holde
That in þis lond men recch of it but smal
Ther is no man it may reporten al
  
I wol not tarien ȝou for it is pryme
And for it is no fruyt but los of tyme
vnto my purpos I wol haue my recours
That so bifelle after þe þridde cours
whil þat þe kyng sit þus in his nobleye
herkyng his mynstrales her þinges pleye
Byforn him atte boord deliciously
In atte halle dore al sodeynly
Ther com a knight vpon a steed of bras
And in his hond a brod myrour of glas
Vpon his thomb he had of gold a ryng
And by his side a naked swerd hangyng
And vp he rideth to þe heyghe bord  
In al þe halle ne was þer spoke a word
For meruayl of þis knight him to byholde
Ful besily þey wayten ȝong and olde
This straunge knight þat cam þus sodeynly
Al armed sauf his heed ful richely
Salued the kyng and queen and lordes alle
By ordre as þey seten in to halle 
with so heigh reuerens and obseruaunce
As wel in speche as in contynaunce 
That Ewen with his olde curtesye
They he come aȝein out of fayrye
Ne couþe him nouȝt amende wiþ no word
And after þis biforn þe highe bord
he with a manly vois sayd his message
After þe forme vsed in his langage
wiþouten vice of sillabil or letter
And for his tale schulde seme þe better
Accordaunt to his wordes was his cheere
As techeth art of speche hem þat it leere
Al be it þat I can nat sowne his style
Ne can nat clymben ouer so heigh a style 
Ȝit say I þis as to comun entent
Thus moche amounteth al þat euer he ment
  
If it so be þat I haue it in mynde 
 he sayd þe kyng of Arraby and yynde
My liege lord on þis solempne day
Saluteth ȝou as he best can or may
he sendeth ȝou in honour of ȝour feste
By me þat am redy at al his heste
This steede of bras þat esily and wel
That can in the space of o day naturel
This is to say in four an twenty houres
wherso ȝou lust  in droughþe or in schoures
Beren ȝour body in to euery place
To which ȝour herte wilneþ for to pace
wiþouten wem of ȝou þurgh foul and fair
Or if ȝou lust to flee as heiȝ in þair
As doþ an egle whan him list to sore  
This same steede schal bere ȝou euermore 
wiþoute harm til ȝe be þer ȝou leste
Though þat ȝe slepen on his bak or reste
And torne aȝein with wryþing of a pyn
he þat it wrought cowþe ful many a gyn
he wayted many a constellacioun
Er he had do þis operacioun
And knew ful many a seal and many a bond
 This mirour eek þat I haue in myn hond
haþ such a mighte  þat men may in it see
when þer schal falle eny aduersite
Vnto ȝour regne vnto ȝour self also
And openly who is ȝour frend or fo
And ouer al þis if eny lady bright
hath set hir hert on eny maner wight
If he be fals sche schal his tresoun see
his newe loue and his subtilite
So openly þat þer schal noþing hyde
wherfor aȝeins þis lusty somer tyde
This mirour and þis ryng þat ȝe may see
he haþ send to my lady Canacee
  
Ȝour excellente doughter þat is heere
 The vertu of þis ryng and ȝe wol heere
Is þis  þat who  so lust it for to were
vpon hir thomb  or in hir purs to bere
Ther is no foul  þat fleeth vnder þe heuen
That schal vnderstonden his steuen
And know his menyng openly and pleyn
and answer him in his langage aȝeyn
And euery gras  þat groweþ vpon roote
Sche schal eek know  to whom it wol do boote
Al be his woundes neuer so deep and wyde
 This naked swerd þat hangeþ by my syde
Such vertu hath þat what man þat it smyte
Thurghout his armur it wol kerue and byte
were it as þikke as a braunched ook
And what man is Iwounded with þe strook
Schal neuer be hool  til þat ȝou lust of grace  
To strok him wiþ þe plat in þilke place
Ther he is hurt  þis is as moche to seyn
Ȝe moote with þe platte swerd aȝein
Stroke him in þe wound and it wol close 
This is þe verray soth wiþouten glose 
It failleth nought whil it is in ȝour hold
And whan þis knight þus had his tale told
he rit out of þe halle and doun he light
his steede which þat schon as sonne bright
Stant in þe court as stille as eny stoon
This knight is to his chambre lad anoon
he is vnarmed and to mete Isett
This presentȝ ben ful richely Ifett
This is to sayn the swerd and the myrrour
And born anon vnto þe highe tour
with certein officers ordeynd þerfore
And vnto Canace þe ryng is bore
Solempnely ther sche syt atte table
But sikerly wiþouten eny fable
  
The hors of bras þat may nat be remewed
It stant as it were to the ground Iglewed
Ther may no man out of þe place it dryue
For noon engyn of wyndyng or polyue·
And cause why for þey can nouȝt þe craft
And þerfor in the place þei haue it laft
Til þat þe knight haþ taught hem þe manere
To voyden him as ȝe schul after heere
Greet was þe pres þat swarmed to and fro
To gauren on þis hors þat stondeth so
For it so wyd was and so brod and long
So wel proporcioned to be strong
Right as it were a steed of lumbardye
Therto so horsly and so quyk of ye
As it a gentil poyleys courser were
For certes fro his tayl vnto his eere
Nature ne art ne couþe him nouȝt amende
In no degre as al þe poeple wende
But euermore her moste wonder was  
How þat it couþe goon and was of bras
It was of fayry as þe poeple semed
Diuerse peple  diuersly þey demed
As many hedes as many wittes been
They murmured as doþ a swarm of been
And made skiles after her fantasies
Rehersyng of þe olde poetries
And seyden it was Ilike þe pagase i equus pegaseus
The hors þat hadde wynges for to fle 
Or elles it was þe grekissch hors Synon
That broughte troye to destruccioun
As men may in þe olde gestes rede 
Myn hert quod oon is euermor in drede
I trow som men of armes ben þerinne
That schapen hem þis cite for to wynne
It were good  þat such þing were knowe 
Anoþer rowned to his felaw lowe 
  
And sayde it lyth for it is raþer lik
An apparence maad by som magik
As Iogelours pleyen at þis festes grete
Of sondry þoughtes þus þey Iangle and trete
As lewed peple demeth comunly
Of þinges þat ben maad more subtily
Than þey can in her lewednes comprehende
They deemen gladly to the badder ende
And som of hem wondred of þe mirrour
That born was vp in to þe maister tour
How men might in hit suche þinges se
Anoþer answerd and sayd it might wel be
Naturelly by composiciouns
Of angels and of heigh reflexiouns
And sayde þat in Rome was such oon
They speeke of alceyt and Vitilyon
Of aristotle  þat writen in her lyues
Of queynte myrrours and prospectyues
As knowen þey þat han her bokes herd
And oþer folk haue wondred on þe swerd
That wolde passe þorughout euery þing  
And fel in speche of Thelophus þe kyng
And of achilles for his queynte spere
For he couþe with hit boþe hele and dere
Right in such wyse as men may wiþ þe swerd
Of which right now ȝe haue ȝour seluen herd
They speeken of sondry hardyng of metal
And speken of medicines þer wiþ al
And how and whan it schulde harded be 
which is vnknowe  algat vnto me 
Tho speeken þey of Canacees ryng
And seyden alle  þat such a wonder þing
Of craft of rynges herd þey neuer noon
Sauf þat he moyses and kyng Salamon
Had a name of connyng in such art
Thus seyen þe peple on euery part
  
But naþeles som seiden þat it was 
wonder þing to make of ferne glas 
And ȝit is glas nouȝt like aisschen of ferne
But for þey han Iknowen it so ferne
Therfor cesseth her ianglyng and her wonder
And sore wondred som of cause of þonder
On ebbe and flood on gossomer and on myst
And on alle þing til þat þe cause is wist
Thus Ianglen þey and demen and deuyse
Til þat þe kyng gan fro his bord arise
Phebus hath lost þe angel merydyonal
And ȝit ascendyng was a best roial
The gentil lyoun wiþ his adryan
whan þat þis gentil kyng þis Cambynskan
Ros fro his bord þer as he sat ful hye
Biforn him goth ful lowde menstralcye
Til he cam to his chambre of Parementȝ
Ther as þer were diuers instrumentȝ
That is ylike an heuen for to heere
 Now dauncen lusty Venus children deere
For in þe fissch her lady sat ful heyȝe
And lokeþ on hem with a frendly eyȝe 
This noble kyng is set vpon his trone 
This straunge knight is fet to him ful sone  
And in the daunce he gan with Canace 
her is þe reuel and þe iolyte
That is not able a dul man to deuyse
he most haue knowe loue and his seruise 
And ben a festly man as freisch as may
That schulde ȝou deuyse such array
who couthe telle ȝou þe forme of daunce
So vncouth and such a freisch countinaunce
Such subtil lokyng of dissimilynges
For drede of Ialous folk apparceyuynges
No man but launcelet and he is deed
Therfore I passe ouer al þis lustyheed
  
A say no more but in þis Iolynesse 
I lete hem til men to soper hem dresse
The styward byt þe spices for to hye
And eek þe wyn in al þis melodye
Thes vsschers and þes squyers ben agon
The spices and þe wyn is come anoon
They eet and drank and whan þis had an ende 
vnto þe temple as resoun was þey wende 
The seruise doon þey and soupen al by day
what needeth ȝou to rehersen her array
Ech man wot wel þat a kynges feste
hath plente to þe lest and to the meste
And deyntees mo þan ben in my knowyng
And after souper goþ þis noble kyng
To see þis hors of bras wiþ al his route
Of lordes and of ladyes al aboute 
Swich wondryng was þer on þis hors of bras
That seth þis grete siege of troye was 
Ther as men wondred on an hors also
Ne was þer such a wondryng as was þo
But fynally þe kyng asked þe knight
The vertu of þis courser and þe might
And prayd him tellen of his gouernaunce
The hors anoon gan for to trippe and daunce
whan þe knight leyd hand vpon his rayne
And sayde sir þer is nomore to sayne  
But whan ȝou lust to ryde any where 
ȝe moote trille a pyn stant in his ere
which I schal telle ȝou bitwen vs two
ȝe moste nempne him to what place also
Or what countre ȝou luste for to ryde
And whan ȝe come þer ȝou lust abyde
Bid him descende and trille anoþer pynne
For þer in lith þe fet of al þe gynne 
And he wol doun descend and do ȝour wille
And in þat place he wol abyde stille
  
Though al þe world had þe contrary swore
he schal nat thennes be Iþrowe ne bore
Or if ȝou lust to bid him þennes goon
Trille þis pyn and he wol vanyssh anoon
Out of þe sight of euery maner wight
And come aȝein  be it by day or night
whan þat ȝou lust to clepen him aȝayn
In such a gyse as I schal ȝow sayn
Bitwixe ȝou and me and þerfor soone
Byd whan ȝou lust þer nys nomor to doone
Enformed when þe kyng was of þe knight
And had conceyued in his wit aright
The maner of þe forme and al þis þing
Ful glad and blith þis noble doughty kyng
Repeyryng to his reuel as biforn
The bridel is vnto þe tour Iborn
And kept among his Iewels leef and deere
The hors vanyscht I not in what manere
Out of her sight ȝe get nomore of me
But þus I lete him in his iolite
This Cambinskan his lordes festeyng
Til wel neigh þe day bigan to spryng
The norice of digestioun þe sleep
Gan to him wynk and bad of him take keep
That merthe and labour wol haue his reste
with a galpyng mouth he him keste
And sayd þat it was tyme to lye doun  
For blood was in his dominacioun
Cherischeþ natures þanne quod he
They þankyn him galpyng by two and þre
And euery wight gan drawe him to his rest
As sleep hem bad þey took it for þe best
  
here dremes schul not now be told for me
Ful were here heedes of fumosite
That causeþ drem of which þer is no charge 
They slepen til it was prime large 
The moste part but it were Canace
Sche was ful mesurable as wommen be
For of hir fader haþ sche take hir leue
To go to reste soon after it was eue 
hir luste not appalled for to be
Ne on þe morwe vnfestly for to se 
And kept hir firste sleep and þan awook
For such a Ioye sche in herte took
Boþe of hir queynte ryng and hir myrrour
That twenty tyme chaunged hire colour
And in hire sleep right for impressioun
Of hir myrrour sche had a visioun
wherfor er þat þe sonne vp gan glyde 
Sche cleped vpon her maistresse beside 
And sayde þat hire luste for to ryse
These olde wommen þat ben gladly wise
As is here maystresse answered hir anoon
And sayd madame whider wold ȝe goon
Thus erly for folk ben alle in reste 
I wil quod sche aryse for me leste
No lenger for to slepe and walke aboute
hir maistres clepeth wommen a gret route 
And vp þey risen a ten oþer a twelue
vp ryseþ fresshe Canace hir selue
As rody and bright as is þe ȝonge sonne
That in þe Ram is ten degrees Ironne
Non heiher was he whan sche redy was
And forth sche walked esily a pas
Arayed after þe lusty sesoun soote  
lightly for to play and walke on foote
Nought but wiþ fyue or six of hir meyne
And a trench fer in þe park goþ sche 
  
The vapour which þat of þe erthe glod
Makeþ þe sonne seme rody and sot
But naþeles it was so fair a sight
That it made alle here hertes for to light
what for þe sesoun what for þe mornyng
And for þe foules þat sche herde syng
For right anoon sche wiste what þey ment
Right by here song and knew al here entent 
 The knotte why þat euery tale is told
If that it be taryed til lust be cold
Of hem þat han hit after herkned ȝore
The sauour passeth euer lenger þe more
For fulsomnes of þe prolixite
And by þis same resoun thinketh me
I schulde to þe knotte condescende 
And make of hir walkynge sone an ende·
Amyddes a tree fordruye as whit as chalk
As Canace was pleyyng in hir walk
There sat a faukoun ouer hir heed ful hye
Þat with a pitous vois bigan to crye
Ibeten hadde sche hir self so pitously
That al the woode resowned of hire cry
wiþ boþe hir wynges to þe reede blood
Ran endelong þe tree þer as sche stood
And euer in oon sche cried and schryght
And wiþ hir bek hir selue so sche pight
That þer nys tigre non ne cruel beste
That dwelleþ eyþer in wood or in foreste
That nold han wept if þat he cowde
For sorw of hir sche schright alwey so lowde
For þer nas neuer ȝit no man on lyue
If that he couþe a faukoun discriue
That herd of such anoþer of fairnesse
As wel of plumage as of gentillesse
Of schap of al þat might Irekened be  
A faukoun peregryn þan semed sche
  
Of fremde lond and euer as sche stood
Sche swowned now and now for lak of blood
Til wel neigh sche falleþ fro þe tre
This faire kynges doughter Canace
That on hir fynger bar þe queynte ryng
Thurgh which sche vnderstood wel euery þing
That eny foul may in his lydne sayn
And couþe answer him in his lydne agayn
haþ vnderstonde what þe faukoun seyde
And wel neigh almost for rewthe sche deyde
And to þe tree sche goth ful hastily
And on þis faukoun lokeþ pitously
And held hir lappe abrod for wel sche wist
The faukoun moste falle fro þe twist
whan þat it swowned next for lak of blood
A long while to wayten hir sche stood
Til atte last sche spak in þis manere
Vnto þe hauk as ȝe schul after heere
 what is þe cause if it be for to telle
That ȝe ben in þat furyall peyne of helle
Quod Canace vnto þis hauk aboue
Is þis for sorwe of deth or elles loue
For as I trowe þis ben causes tuo
That causen most a gentil herte wo
Of oþer harm it needeþ nouȝt to speke
For ȝe ȝour self vpon ȝour self awreke
which þat preueþ wel þat either Ire or drede
Mote ben enchesoun of ȝour cruel dede
Sith þat I see noon oþer wight ȝou chace
For loue of god so doþ ȝour selue grace
Or what ben ȝour helpe for west ner Este
Ne saugh I neuer er now no bryd ne beste
That ferde with himself so pitously
Ȝe sle me with ȝour sorwe so verrily
I haue of ȝou so gret compassioun
For goddes loue com fro þe tree a doun
  
And as I am a kynges doughter trewe  
If þat I verrayly þe cause knewe
Of ȝour disese if it lay in my might
I wold amenden it if þat I might
Als wisly help me grete god of kynde
And herbes schal I right ynowe fynde
To helen with ȝour hurtes hastyly
Tho schright þis faukoun more pitously
Than euer sche did and fil to ground anoon
And lay aswowne deed as eny stoon
Til Canace hath in hir lap ytake
vnto þat tyme sche gan of swowne slake 
And after þat sche gan of swown abreyde
Right in hir haukes lydne thus sche seyde
That pite renneth sone in gentil hert
Felyng his similitude in peynes smerte
Is proued alday as men may see
As wel by werk as by auctorite
For gentil herte kepeth gentillesse 
I see wel þat ȝe haue on my distresse
Compassioun my faire Canace
Of verray wommanly benignite 
That nature in ȝour principles haþ set
But noon hope for to fare þe bet
But for to obeye vnto ȝour herte fre
And for to make othere war by me
As by þe whelp chastised is þe lyoun
And for þat cause and þat conclusioun
whiles þat I haue a leyser and a space
Myn harm I wil confessen er I pace
And whil sche euer of hir sorwe tolde
That oþer wept as sche to water wolde 
Til þat þe faucoun bad hir to be stille 
And with a sighhe  þus sche sayd hir tille
 Ther I was allas þat ilke day
And fostred in a Roch of marble gray
  
So tendrely that noþing eyled me 
I wiste not  what was aduersite
Til I couþe flee ful heigh vnder þe sky  
Tho dwelled a tercelet me faste by
That semed welle of alle gentillesse
Al were he ful of tresoun and falsnesse
It was Iwrapped vnder humble cheere
And vnder heewe of trouþe in such manere
Vnder plesaunce and vnder besy peyne
That no wight wende þat he couþe feyne
So deep in greyn he deyed his colours
Right as a serpent hut him vnder floures
Til he may see his tyme for to byte
Right so þis god of loue þis ypocrite
Doþ so his sermonys and his obseruaunce
vnder subtil colour and aqueyntaunce
That sowneth vnto gentilesse of loue
As in a thombe is al þe faire aboue
And vnder is þe corps whiche þat ȝe wot
Such as was þis Ipocrite boþe cold and hot
And in this wise he serued his entent
That sauf þe feend noon wiste what he ment
Til he so long had weped and compleyned
And many a ȝeer his seruice to me feyned
Til þat myn hert to pitous and to nyce
Al Innocent of his crouned malice
Forfered of his deth as þoughte me
vpon his othes and his sewerte
Graunted him loue vpon þis condicioun
That euermo myn honour and my renoun
were saued boþe pryuy and apert
This is to sayn þat after his desert
I ȝaf him al myn hert and al my þought
god woot and he þat oþer weye nought
And took his hert in chaunge of myn for ay
But soþ is sayd go siþens many a day
  
A trew wight and a theef þenketh nouȝt oon
And when he saugh þe þyng so fer Igoon
That I graunted him fully my loue 
In such a wyse as I haue sayd aboue 
And ȝeuen him my trewe hert as fre  
As he swor he ȝaf his herte to me 
Anon þis Tigre ful of doublenesse
Fil on his knees with so gret deuoutenesse
wiþ high reuerence and as by his chere
So lyk a gentil louer of manere
So rauysched as it semede for Ioye
That neuer Iason ne Parys of Troye
Iason certes ne noon oþer man
Siþ lameth was þat alþer first bygan
To louen two as writen folk biforn
Ne neuer siþ þe firste man was born
Ne couþe man by twenty þousand part
Contrefete þe sophemes of his art
Ne were worþy to vnbokel his galoche
Ther doublenes of feynyng schold approche
Ne so couþe þankyn a knight as he did me
His maner was an heuen for to see
To eny womman were sche neuer so wys
So peynteth he and kembeth poynt deuys
As wel his wordes as his continaunce
And I so loued him for his obeisaunce
And for þe trouthe I demed in his herte
That if so were þat eny þing him smerte
And were it neuer so litel and I it wist
Me þought I felte deth at myn hert twist
And schortly so ferforth þis þing went
That my wil was his willes instrument
This is to say my wille obeied his wille
In alle þing as fer as resoun fille
kepyng þe boundes of my worschip euer
Ne neuer had I þing so leef ne leuer
  
As him god woot ne neuer schal nomo
This laste lenger þan a ȝeer or two
That I supposed of him nought but good
But fynally atte laste þus it stood
That fortune wolde þat he moste twynne
Out of þe place which þat I was Inne
wher me was wo it is no questioun   
I can nat make of it descripcioun
For o þing dar I telle boldely
I know what is þe peyne of deth þerby
which harm I felt for he ne mighte byleue
So on a day of me he took his leue
So sorwful eek þat I went verrayly
That he had feled als moche as I
whan þat I herd him speke and saugh his hewe
But naþeles I þought he was vntrewe
And eek þat he schulde repeire aȝeyn
wiþinne a litel while soþ to seyn
And resoun wold eek þat he moste go for his honour
Wherfor I wold not ben ayein his honour
Than I made vertu of necessite
And took it wel seþens it moste be
As I best might I had for him my sorwe
And took him by þe hand seint Iohn to borwe
And sayde þus  lo I am ȝour al
Beþ such as I haue be to ȝou and schal
what he answerd it needeþ nat to reherse
who can best say þan he who can do werse 
whan he haþ al wel sayd þan haþ he doon
Therfor bihoueþ him a ful long spoon
That schal ete wiþ a feend þus herd I say
So atte last he moste forþ his way
And forth he fleeth til he cam þer him leste
whan it cam him to purpos for to reste
I trow he hadde þilke text in mynde
That alle þing repeyryng to his kynde
  
Gladeþ himself þus sey men as I gesse
Men louen of kynde newefangilnesse
As briddes doon þat men in cage feede
For þeigh þou night and day take of hem heede
And straw her cage faire and soft as silk
And ȝeue hem sugre hony breed and mylk
Ȝet right anoon as his dore is vppe
he with his feet wil sporne doun his cuppe
And to þe wode
lasse þan a þousand pound he wolde nought haue
Ne gladly for þat somme he wolde not goon
Aurilius wiþ blisful hert anoon
Answerde þus fy on a þousand pound
This wyde world which þat men say is round
I wold it ȝiue if I were lord of it
This bargeyn is ful dryue for we ben knyt
Ȝe schal be payed trewly by my trouþe 
But lokeþ now for necligence or slouþe
Ȝe tarie vs heer no lenger þan to morwe 
Nay quod þis clerk haue her my faith to borwe
To bed is goon aurilius whan him leste
And wel neigh al night he had his reste
  
what for his labour and his hope of blisse
His woful hert of penaunce had a lisse 
vpon þe morwe whan þat it was day
To breteigne take þei þe righte way
Aurilius and þis magicien bisyde
And ben descendid þer þay wol abyde
And þis was as þese bookes me remembre
The colde frosty seisoun of Decembre
Phebus wax old and hewed lyk latoun
That in his hoote declinacioun
Schon as þe burned gold with stremes bright
But now in Capricorn adoun he light
wher as he schon ful pale I dar wel sayn
The bitter frostes with þe sleet and rayn
Destroyed haþ þe grene in euery ȝerd
Ianus sit by þe fuyr wiþ double berd
And drynkeþ of his bugle horn þe wyn
Biforn him stont þe braun of toskid swyn
And Nowel crieþ euery lusty man
Aurilius in al þat euer he can
Doþ to his maister chier and reuerence
And peyneþ him to doon his diligence
To bringen him out of his peynes smerte
Or wiþ a swerd þat he wold slytte his herte
This subtil clerk such rouþe had of þis man
That night and day he spedeþ him þat he can  
To wayte a tyme of his conclusioun
This is to say to make Illusioun
By such an apparence of iogelrie
I can no termes of astrologie
That sche and euery wight schold wene and saye
That of Breteygn þe rokkes were a waye
Or elles þey sonken were vnder þe grounde
So atte last he haþ a tyme Ifounde
To make his iapes and his wrecchednesse 
Of such a supersticious cursednesse 
  
His tables tollitanes forþ he brought
Ful wel corrected ne þer lakked nought
Neiþer his collect ne his expans yeeres
Ne his rootes ne his oþer geeres 
As ben his centris and his argumentis
And his proporcionels conuenientis
For her equaciouns in euery þing 
And by his þre speeres in his worching
he knew ful wel how fer alluath was schoue
For þe heed of þilk fixe aries aboue
That in þe fourþe speere considred is
Ful subtilly he calkild al þis
whan he had founde his firste mancioun
He knew þe remenaunt by proporcioun
And knew þe arisyng of þis moone wel
And in whos face and terme and euery del
And knew ful wel þe moones mancioun
Acordaunt to his operacioun
And knew also his other obseruaunces
For suche illusiouns and suche meschaunces
As hethen folk vsed in þilke dayes
For which no lenger maked he delayes
But þurgh his magik for a wike or tweye
It semed þat þe rokkes were aweye
Aurilius which ȝet dispayred is
wher he schal haue his loue or fare amys
Awayteþ night and day on þis miracle
And whan he knew þat þer was noon obstacle  
That voyded were þese rokkes euerich oon
Doun to his maistres feet he fel anoon
And sayd I wrecched woful aurilius
Thanke ȝou lord and my lady Venus
That me han holpe fro my cares colde 
And to þe temple his way forþ he haþ holde
wher as he knew he schold his lady se
And whan he saugh his tyme anoon right he
  
with dredful hert and with ful humble cheere
Salued haþ his owne lady deere
My souerayn lady quod þis woful man
whom I most drede and loue as I can
And loþest were of al þis world displese 
Nere it þat I for ȝou haue such desese 
That I most deye her at ȝoure foot anoon
Nought wold I telle how me is wo bygoon
But certes ouþer most I dye or pleyne
Ȝe sleen me gulteles for verrey peyne
But of my deþ þough þat ȝe haue no rouþe
Auyseth ȝow or þat ȝe breke ȝour trouþe
Repenteþ ȝow for þilke god aboue
Ȝe me sleen by cause þat I ȝou loue
For madame wel ȝe woot what ȝe han hight
Nat þat I chalenge eny þing of right
Of ȝow my souerayn lady but ȝoure grace
But in a gardyn ȝonde at such a place
Ȝe wot right wel what ȝe byhighte me
And in myn hond ȝour trouþe plighte ȝe
To loue me best god woot ȝe sayde so
Al be þat I vnworthy am þerto
Ma dame I speke it for thonour of ȝow
More þan to saue myn hertes lif right now
I haue do so as ȝe comaunded me
And if ȝe vouche sauf ȝe may go se
Doþ as ȝou list haue ȝoure byheste in mynde
For quyk or deed right þer ȝe schul me fynde
In ȝow liþ al to do me lyue or deye
But wel I wot þe rokkes ben aweye  
he takeþ his leue and he astoned stood
In alle hir face nas oon drop of blood
Sche wend neuer haue be in such a trappe
Allas quod sche þat euer þis schulde happe
For wend I neuer by possibilite
That such a monstre or merueyl mighte be 
  
It is agayns þe proces of nature
And hom sche goþ a sorwful creature
For verray fere vnneþe may sche go
Sche wepeþ wayleþ al a day or tuo
And swowneþ þat it rouþe was to see
But why it was to no wight tolde sche
For out of toune was goon aruegarius
But to hir self sche spak and sayde þus
wiþ face pale and with ful sorwful chiere
In hir compleignt as ȝe schul after hiere
 Allas quod sche on þe fortune I pleyne
That vnwar wrapped me hast in þy cheyne
Fro which tescape woot I no socour
Saue oonly deþ or elles dishonour
Oon of þese tuo bihoueth me to chese 
But naþeles ȝet haue I leuer leese
My lif þan of my body to haue schame
Or knowe myselue fals or lese my name 
And with my deþ I may be quyt Iwys
Hath þer not many a noble wyf er þis 
And many a mayden slayn hirself allas
Raþer þan with her body doon trespas 
Ȝis certeynly lo stories beren witnes
whan þritty tirauntȝ ful of cursednes
hadde slayn phidon in athenes atte fest
Thay comaunded his doughtres to arest
And bryngen hem biforn hem in despit
And naked to fulfille her foule delyt
In her fadres blood þey made hem daunce
vpon þe pauyment god ȝeue hem meschaunce
For which þese woful maydens ful of drede
Raþer þan þey wolde lese her maydenhede  
They priuely ben stert in to a welle 
And drenched hemselfen as þe bookes telle
 They of mecene leet enquere and seeke 
Of lacidomye fifty maydenes eeke 
  
On which þay wolden doon her leccherie
But was þer noon of al þat companye
was slayn and wiþ a good entente
Ches raþer for to deye þan to assente
To ben oppressed of hir maydenhede
why schuld I þan to deyen ben in drede
 Lo eek þe Tyraunt aristoclides
That loued a mayden heet Stimphalides
whan þat hir father slayn was on a night
vnto dyanes temple goþ sche right
And hent þe ymage in hir hondes tuo
Fro which ymage wold sche neuer go
No wight might of hit hir hondes race
Til sche was slayn right in þe selue place
Now siþ þat maydens hadde such despit
To ben defouled with mannes foul delit
wel aught a wif rather hirself to sle
Than be defouled as it thenkeþ me
 what schal I seyn of hasdrubaldes wyf
That at Cartage byraft hirself þe lyf
For whan sche saugh þat Romayns wan þe toun
Sche took hir children alle and skipte a doun
In to þe fuyr and ches raþer to deye
Than eny romayn dide hir vilonye
 Haþ nought lucresse slayn hirself allas
At Rome whanne sche oppressid was
Of tarquyn for hir þought it was a schame 
To lyuen whan sche hadde lost hir name
 The seuen maydens of milifie also
han slayn hemself for verray drede and wo
Raþer þan folk of Gawle hem schulde oppresse
Mo þan a thousand stories as I gesse
Couþe I now telle as touching þis matiere
 whan habradace was slayn his wif so deere  
hirseluen slough and leet hir blood to glyde 
In habradaces woundes deepe and wyde 
  
And seyde my body atte leste way
Ther schal no wight defoulen if I may
what schold I mo ensamples her of sayn
Seþþen so many han hemseluen slayn
wel raþer þan þey wolde defouled be 
I wol conclude þat it is best for me
To slen myself þan be defouled þus
I wol be trewe vnto aruegarius
Or rather sle myself in som manere
As dede Democionis douȝter deere
By cause sche wolde nought defouled be 
O cedasus it is ful gret pite
To reden how þy doughteren dyed allas
That slowe hemself for suche maner caas
As gret a pite was it or wel more
The theban mayden þat for nichonore
hirseluen slough right for such maner wo
Anoþer Theban mayden dede right so
For oon of macidone had hir oppressed
Sche with hire deþ maydenhede redressed
what schal I sayn of Niceratis wif
That for such caas biraft hir self hir lyf
how trewe eek was cito alcebiades
his loue þat rather to dyen ches
Than for to suffre his body vnburied be
Lo which a wif was alceste quod sche
what saiþ omer of good penolope
Al grece knoweþ of hir chastite
Par di of laodomya is writen þus
That whan out of Troye was Protheselaus
No lenger wol sche lyue after his day
The same of noble porcia telle I may
wiþoute brutes kynde sche myȝt not lyue
To whom sche had al hool hir herte ȝyue
The parfyt wyfhod of artemesye
honoured is þurgh al þe Barbarie    
O thena queen þy wifly chastite
To alle wyues may a mirour be
   
    
Thus playned Dorigen a day or tweye
Purposyng euer þat sche wolde deye
But naþeles vpon þe thridde night
hom cam arueragus þis worþy knight
And asked hir why þat sche wept so sore 
And sche gan wepe euer lenger þe more
Allas quod sche þat euer was I born
Thus haue I sayd quod sche þus haue I sworn
And told him al as ȝe han herd biforn
It nedeþ nought reherse it you no more
 This housbond wiþ glad chiere in good wise
Answerd and sayde as I schal ȝou deuyse
Is þer aught elles Dorigen but þis
Nay nay quod sche god me so rede and wis
This is to moche and it were goddes wille
Ȝe wyf quod he let slepe þat may be stille
It may be wel peraunter ȝet to day
Ȝe schal ȝour trouþe holden by my fay
For god so wisly haue mercy on me
I hadde wel leuer Istekid for to be
For verray loue which I to ȝou haue 
But if ȝe scholde ȝour trouþe kepe and saue
Trouþe is þe heighest þing þat men may kepe
But wiþ þat word he gan anoon to wepe
And sayde I ȝow forbede vp peyne of deþ
That neuer whil þe lasteth lyf or breth
To no wight telle þou of þis auenture
As I may best I wil my woo endure
Ne make no contenaunce of heuynesse
Þat folk of ȝou may deme harm or gesse
And for he cleped a squyer and a mayde
Goþ forþ anoon wiþ Dorigen he sayde
  
And bryngeþ hir to such a place anoon
Thay take her leue and on her wey þey gon
But þay ne wiste why sche þider went
He nolde no wight tellen his entent  
    
    
    
    
    
    
This squyer which þat hight aurelius
On dorigen þat was so amerous
Of aduenture happed hire to mete
Amyd þe toun right in þe quyke strete
As sche was boun to goon þe wey forþright
Toward þe Gardyn þer as sche had hight
And he was to þe gardynward also 
For wel he spyed whan sche wolde go
Out of hir hous to eny maner place
But þus þay mette of aduenture or grace
And he salueth hir with glad entent
And askith hire whiderward sche went
And sche answered half as sche were mad
vnto þe gardyn as myn housbond bad
My trouþe for to holde allas allas
Aurilius gan wondren on þis caas
And in his hert had gret compassioun
Of hire and of hir lamentacioun
And of Arueragus þe worþy knight
That bad hir hold al þat sche hadde hight
So loþ him was his wif schuld breke hir trouþe
And in his hert he caught of this gret rouþe
Consideryng þe best on euery syde
That fro his lust ȝet were him leuer abyde
Than doon so high a cheerlissch wrecchednesse
Agayns fraunchis of alle gentilesce
  
For which in fewe wordes sayd he þus
Madame saith to ȝour lord arueragus
That siþ I se his grete gentilesse
To ȝou and eek I se wel ȝour distresse
That him were leuer haue schame and þat were rouþe 
Than ȝe to me schulde breke ȝoure trouþe
I haue wel leuer euer to suffre woo
Than I departe þe loue bytwix ȝow tuo
I ȝow relesse madame in to ȝour hond
Quyt euery seurement and euery bond
That ȝe han maad to me as her biforn
Sith þilke tyme which þat ȝe were born  
My trouþe I plight I schal ȝow neuer repreue
Of no byhest and her I take my leue
As of þe trewest and þe beste wif
That euer ȝit I knew in al my lyf
But euery wyf be war of hir byhest
On Dorigen remembreþ atte lest
Thus can a squyer doon a gentil dede
As wel as can a knyght wiþouten drede
Sche þankeþ him vpon hir knees al bare 
And hoom vnto hir housbond is sche fare 
And told him al as ȝe han herd me sayd
And be ȝe siker he was so wel apayd
That it were impossible me to write
what schuld I lenger of þis caas endite
Arueragus and Dorigen his wif
In souereyn blisse leden forþ here lyf
Neuer eft ne was þer anger hem bytwen
he cherisscheþ hir as þough sche were a queen
And sche was to him trewe for euermore 
Of þese tuo folk ȝe gete for me nomore 
 Aurilius þat his cost haþ al forlorn
Curseþ þe tyme þat euer he was born
Allas quod he allas þat I byhight
Of pured gold a thousand pound of wight
  
vnto þis philosophre how schal I doo
I se no more but þat I am fordoo
Myn heritage moot I needes selle 
And ben a begger her may I not duelle
And schamen al my kynrede in þis place
But I of him may gete better grace
But naþeles I wol of him assay
At certeyn dayes ȝeer by ȝer to pay
And þanke him of his grete curtesye
My trouþe wol I kepe I wol nouȝt lye
with herte soor he goþ vn to his cofre
And broughte gold vnto þis philosophre
The value of fyf hundred pound I gesse
And him bysecheth of his gentilesce  
To graunte him dayes of þe remenaunt
And sayde maister I dar wel make auaunt
I fayled neuer of my trouþe as ȝit
For sikerly my dettes schal be quyt
Towardes ȝow how þat euer I fare
To goon a begge in my kurtil bare
But wolde ȝe vouche sauf vpon seurte
Tuo ȝer or þre for to respite me
Than were I wel for elles most I selle
Myn heritage þer is nomore to telle
 Þis philosophre sobrely answerde 
And seyde þus whan he þese wordes herde
Haue I not holden couenaunt vnto þe
Ȝis certes wel and trewely quod he 
Hastow nouȝt had þy lady as þe liketh
No no quod he and sorwfully he sikeþ
what was þe cause tel me if þou can
Aurilius his tale anoon bygan
And told him al as ȝe han herd bifore
It needeþ nat to ȝou reherse it more
he sayde arueragus of gentilesse
had leuer dye in sorwe and in distresse
  
Than þat his wyf were of hir trouþe fals
The sorwe of Dorigen he tolde him als
how loþ hir was to ben a wikked wikked wyf
And þat sche leuer had han lost hir lyf
And þat hir trouþe sche swor þurgh Innocence
Sche neuer erst hadde herd speke of apparence
That made me han of hir so gret pyte
By cause hir housebond sente hir to me
And right as frely sent I hir to him agayn
Þis is al and som þer is no more to sayn
The philosopher answerde leue broþer
Euerich of ȝow dede gentilly to oþer
Thow art a squyer and he is a knight
But god forbede for his blisful might
But if a clerk couþe doon as gentil dede
As wel as eny of ȝou it is no drede  
Sire I relesse þe þy þousond pound
As þou right now were crope out of þe ground
Ne neuer er now ne haddest knowen me
For sire I wol not take a peny of þe
For al my craft ne nought for my trauayle 
Thou hast ypayed wel for my vitayle 
It is ynough and far wel haue good day
And took his hors and forþ he goþ his way
 Lordynges þis questioun wolde I axe now 
which was þe moste free as þinketh ȝow
Now telleþ me or þat I ferþer wende 
I can no more my tale is at an ende 
THe minister and þe norice vnto vices
which þat men clepe in englisch ydelnesse 
The porter at þe gates is of delicis
To eschiewe and by her contrary hire oppresse
That is to say by leful besynesse 
wel oughte we to do al oure entente
Lest þat þe fend þurgh ydelnesse vs hente 
For he þat wiþ his þousand cordes slye

He can so lightly cacche him in his trappe 
Til þat a man be hent right by þe lappe 
He is nouȝt war þe fend haþ him in honde

And þough men dredde neuer for to deye
Ȝet seen men wel by resoun douteles
That ydelnes is roten sloggardye
Of which þer comeþ neuer good encres
And sin þat slouþ her holdeþ in a lees
Oonly to sleep and for to ete and drynke
And to deuoure al þat oþer swynke

After þe legende in translacioun

Thow nobelest so ferforþ oure nature
That no disdeyn þe maker had of kynde

Wiþinne þe cloyster of þi blisful sydes

But oonly helpist hem þat prayen þe
But often tyme of þy benignite

Now help þou meke and blisful faire mayde

Of euerich lust and fals affeccioun

Of hem þat ben in sorwe and in destresse 
Now help for to my werk I wil me dresse 
  
Ȝet pray I ȝou þat reden þat I write 
Forȝeue me þat I doo no diligence
This ilke story subtilly to endite
For boþe haue I þe wordes and sentence
Of him þat at þe seintes reuerence
The story wroot and folwen hir legende 
And pray ȝow þat ȝe wol my werk amende 
First wol I ȝow þe name of seint Cecile
Expoune as men may in hir story se 
It is to say on englisch heuenes lilie
For pure chastenesse of virginite
Or for sche witnesse hadde of honeste
And grene of conscience and of good fame 
The soote sauour lilie was her name
Or cecile is to say þe way of blynde 
For sche ensample was by way of techynge
Or elles Cecily as I writen fynde
Is ioyned by a maner of conioynynge
Of heuen and lya and here in figurynge
The heuen is sette for þought of holynesse 
And lya for hir lastyng besynesse 
Cecili may eek be seyd in þis manere 
wantyng of blyndnes for hir grete light  
Of sapience and of þilke þewes cleere 
Or elles lo þis maydenes name bright
Of heuen and loos comes of which by right
Men might hir wel þe heuen of peple calle 
Ensample of goode and wise werkes alle
  
For leos peple in englissh is to say
And righ as men may in þe heuen see
The sonne and moone and sterres euery way
Right so men gostly in þis mayden free
Seen of faiþ þe magnanimite 
And eek þe clernes hool of sapience
And sondry werkes bright of excellence
And right so as þese philosofres wryte
That heuen is swyft and round and eek brennynge
Right so was faire Cecily þe whyte
Ful swyft and besy euer in good werkynge 
And round and hool in good perseuerynge
And brennyng euer in charite ful bright
Now haue I ȝow declared what sche hight
This mayden bright Cecilie as hir lyf saiþ
was comen of Romayns and of noble kynde 
And from hir cradel vp fostred in þe faiþ
Of crist and bar his gospel in hir mynde
Sche neuer cessed as I writen fynde
Of hire prayer and god to loue and drede
Byseching him to kepe hir maydenhede
And whan þis mayde schuld vnto a man
Ywedded be þat was ful ȝong of age
which þat Icleped was walirian
And day was comen of hir mariage
Sche ful deuout and humble in hir currage
vnder hir robe of gold þat sat ful faire
Hadde next hir fleissh Iclad hir in an heire
  
And whil þe organs made melodie 
To god alloon in herte þus sang sche 
O lord my soule and eek my body gye
Vnwemmed lest þat I confounded be 
And for his loue þat deyde vpon a tre  
Euery secound or þridde day sche faste
Ay biddyng in hire orisouns ful faste 
The nyght cam and to bedde most sche goon
with hir housbond as oft is þe manere
And priuely to him sche sayde anoon
O swete and wel biloued spouse deere 
Ther is a counseil and ȝe wold it heere 
which þat right fayn I wold vnto ȝou saye
So that ȝe swere ȝe schul it not bywraye
Valirian gan fast vnto hir swere
That for no caas ne þing þat mighte be
he scholde neuer mo bywreye hire
And þanne at erst þus sayde sche
I haue an aungel which þat loueþ me
That wiþ gret loue wher so I wake or slepe
Is redy ay my body for to kepe
    
Iff ȝe me touche or loue in vilonye

And in ȝoure ȝouþe þus schulde ȝe dye
And if þat ȝe in clene loue me gye
he wol ȝow loue as me for ȝour clennesse 
And schewe to ȝou his ioye and his brightnesse
  
Valirian corrected as god wolde 
Answerde agayn if I schal truste þe 
Let me þat aungel se and him biholde
And if þat it a verray aungel be 
Than wol I doon as þou hast prayed me
And if þou loue anoþer man forsoþe
Right wiþ þis swerd þan wol I slee ȝou boþe 
Cecilie answerd anoon right in þis wise
If þat ȝow list þe aungel schul ȝe see
So that ȝe trowe on crist and ȝou baptise
Goþ forþ to Via apia quod sche 
That fro þis toun ne stant but myles þre
And to þe pore folkes þat þer duelle
Saith hem right þus as þat I schal ȝou telle 
Telle hem I cecilie ȝow vnto hem sent
To schewen ȝow þe good vrban þe olde   
For secre needes and for good entente 
And whan þat ȝe seint vrban han byholde 
Tel him þe wordes which þat I to ȝow tolde 
And whan þat he haþ purged ȝou fro synne
Than schul ȝe se þat aungel er ȝe twynne 
Valirian is to þe place ygoon
And right as him was taught by his lernynge
He fond þis holy old vrban anoon
Among þe seyntes buriels lotynge
And he anoon wiþoute taryinge
Did his message and whan þat he it tolde
vrban for ioye his handes gan vp holde
  
The teres from his eyȝen let he falle
Almyȝty lord O ihū crist quod he 
Sower of chaste counseil herde of vs alle
The fruyt of þilke seed of chastite
That þou hast sowe to Cecilie tak to þe

The serueþ ay þin owne þral Cecile
For þilke spouse þat sche took right now
Ful lyk a fers lyoun sche sendeþ here
As meek as euer was eny lamb to ȝow
And wiþ þat word anoon þer gan appere 
An old man clad in white cloþes clere
That had a book wiþ lettres of gold in honde 
And gan toforn Valirian to stonde 
Valirian as deed fyl doun for drede
whan he him say  and he him vp hente þo
And on his book right þus he gan to rede 
O lord o feith oon god wiþouten mo
On cristendom and oon fader of alle also
Abouen alle and ouer alle euery where
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
And pope vrban him cristened right þere
  
Valirian goþ home and fint Cecilie
wiþinne his chambre with an aungel stonde 
This aungel had of Roses and of lilie
Corounes tuo þe which he bar in honde
And first to Cecilie as I vnderstonde

That oþer to valerian hir make
Wiþ body clene and wiþ vnwemmed þought
kepeþ ay wel þese corounes þre
Fro paradys to ȝou I haue hem brought
Ne neuer moo ne schul þey roten be
Ne leese here soote sauour trusteþ me
Ne neuer wight schal seen hem wiþ his ye
But he be chast and hate vilonye
And þou valirian for þou so soone
Assentedist to good counseil also
Say what þe list and þou schalt haue þi boone
I haue a broþer quod Valirian þo
That in þis world I loue no man so
I pray ȝow þat my broþer may haue grace
To knowe þe trouþe as I doo in þis place
The aungel sayde god liketh þy request
And boþe with þe palme of martirdom
Ȝe schullen come vnto his blisful feste 
And with þat word tiburce his broþer com
And whan þat he þe sauour vndernom
which þat þe roses and þe lilies cast
wiþinne hir hert he gan to wondre fast 
  
And sayde I wondre þis tyme of þe ȝer
whennes þat soote sauour comeþ so
Of Rose and lilies þat I smelle her
For þough I had hem in myn hondes tuo
The sauour might in me no depper go
The swete smel þat in myn hert I fynde
Hath chaunged me al in anoþer kynde
Valirian sayd tuo corouns haue we
Snow whyt and rose reed þat schinen cleere 
whiche þat þine eyȝen han no might to see 
And þou smellest hem þurgh my prayere
So schalt þou seen hem my lieue broþere deere
If so be þou wilt wiþouten slouþe
Bilieuen aright and knowen verray trouthe 
Tyburce answerde says þou þus to me  
In soþenes or in drem I herkne þis
In dremes quod valirian han we be
Vnto þis tyme broþer myn Iwys
As now at erst in trouþe oure duellyng is

Quod valirian þat schal I þe deuyse
The aungel of god haþ me trouþe ytaught

The ydols and be clene and elles nouȝt
And of þe miracles of þese corones tweye
Seynt ambrose in his prefas list to seye
Solempnely þis noble doctour deere
Comendeþ it and saiþ in þis maneere
  
The palme of martirdom for to receyue 
Seynt Cecilie fulfilled of goddes ȝifte
The world and eek hir chamber gan sche weyue 
witnes tyburces and Cecilies schrifte
To whiche god of his bounte wolde schifte
Corounes tuo of floures wel smellynge
And made his aungel home þe croune brynge
The mayde haþ brought þis men to blisse aboue 
The world haþ wist what it is worþ certeyn
Deuocioun of chastite to loue
Tho schewed him Cecilie al open and pleyn
That alle ydoles nys but þing in veyn
For þay ben doumbe and þerto þey ben deue
And chargeþ him his ydoles for to leue
Who so troweþ not þis a best he is

And sche gan kisse his brest þat herde þis
And was ful glad he couþe trouþe espye
This day I take þe for myn allye
Sayde þis blisful faire mayde deere 
And after þat sche sayde as ȝe may heere
Lo right so as þe loue of crist quod sche
Made me þy brotheres wyf right in þat wyse
Anoon for myn allye heer take I þe 
Sin þat þou wilt thyne ydoles despise  
Go with þi broþer now and þe baptise
And make þe clene so þat þou mowe biholde
The aungeles face of which þy broþer tolde
  
Tyburce answerde and sayde broþer dere
First tel me whider I schal and to what man
To whom quod he  com forth with good cheere 
I wol þe lede vnto þe pope vrban
Til vrban broþer myn quod valirian
Quod tyburce wilt þou me þider lede 
Me þenkeþ þat it were a wonder dede 
Ne menist þou nat vrban quod he þo
That is so ofte dampned to be deed
And woneþ in halkes alway to and fro
And dar nouȝt oones putte forþ his heed
Men schold him brenne in a fuyr so reed
If he were founde or if men might him spye
And we also to bere him companye
And whil we seken þilke diuinite
That is Ihyd in heuen priuely
Algate Ibrent in þis world schal we be
To whom Cecilie answerde bodyly
Men mighten wel and skilfully
This lyf to lese myn oughne dere brother
If þis were lyuyng oonly and noon oþer
But þer is better lif in oþer place
That neuer schal be lost drede þe nouȝt
which goddes sone vs tolde þurgh his grace
The fadres sone þat alle þing hath wrought
And al þat wrought is wiþ a skilful þought
The gost þat fro þe fader gan procede
haþ sowled hem wiþouten eny drede
  
By word and miracle hihe goddes sone
whan he was in þis world declared heere 
That þer was oþer lyf þer men may wone 
To whom answerde Tyburce of suster deere
Ne seydest þou right now in þis manere
Ther nys but oo god o lord in soþfastnesse
And now of þre how maystow bere witnesse  
That schal I telle quod sche er þat I go
Right as a man haþ sapiences þre
Memorie eyen and intellect also
So in oo being in diuinite
Thre persones may þer right wel be
Tho gan sche him ful besily to preche 
Of cristes come and of his peynes teche 
And many pointes of his passioun
how goddes sone in þis world was wiþholde
To doon mankynde pleyn remissioun
That was Ibounde in synne and cares colde 
Al þis þing sche vnto Tyburce tolde 
And after þis thiburce in good entente
wiþ valirian to pope vrban he wente 
That þanked god and wiþ glad hert and light
he cristened him and made him in þat place 
Parfyt in his lernynge goddes knyght
And after þis thiburce gat such grace 
That euery day he say in tyme and space 
The aungel of god and euery maner boone 
That he god asked  it were sped ful soone
  
IT were ful hard by ordre for to sayne
how many wondres Ihc for hem wroughte
But atte last to tellen schort and playne ·
The sergeantȝ of þe toun of Rome hem soughte
And hem byforn almache þe prefect broughte
which hem apposed and knew alle here entente
And to þe ymage of Iubiter hem sente
And saide whoso wil not sacrifise
Swope of his heued þis my sentence heere
Anoon þese martires þat I ȝou deuyse
Oon maximus þat was an officere 
Of þe prefectes and his counceilere 
hem hent  and whan he forþ þe seyntes ladde
him self he wept for pite þat he hadde 
Whan maximus had herd þe seintes lore
he gat him of his tormentoures leue
And bad hem to his hous wiþouten more  
And with her preching er þat it were eue
Thay gonne fro þe tormentoures to reue
And fro maxime and fro his folk echoone
The false faith to trowe in god alloone
Cecilie cam whan it was waxen night
with prestis þat hem cristenid alle in feere 
And afterward whan day was waxen light
Cecilie hem sayde with a ful stedefast chere 
Now cristes owne knyȝtes leef and deere
Cast al away þe werkes of derknes
And armith ȝou in armur of brightnes
  
Ȝe han forsoþe ydoon a greet batayle 
Ȝoure cours is doon ȝoure faith han ȝe conserued
Goþ to þe coroun of lyf þat may not fayle 
The rightful iugge which þat ȝe han serued
Schal ȝeue it ȝow as ȝe han it deserued
And whan þis þing was sayd as I deuyse
Men ladde hem forþ to doon þe sacrifise 
But whan þey were to þe place ybrouȝt
To telle schortly þe conclusioun
They nolde encense ne sacrifice right nought
But on her knees þey setten hem adoun
wiþ humble hert and sad deuocioun
And leften boþe her heedes in þe place
here soules wenten to þe king of grace 
This maximus þat say þis king betyde 
wiþ pitous teeres tolde it anoon right
That he here soules saugh to heuen glyde
with aungels ful of clernes and of light
And with his word conuerted many a wight
For which almachius dede him so bete
with whippes of leed til he his lif gan lete 
Cecilie him took and buried him anoon
By Thiburce and valirian softely
wiþinne hire berieng place vnder þe stoon
And after þis almachius hastily
Bad his ministres fecchen openly
Cecilie so þat sche might in his presence  
Doon sacrifice and Iubiter encense 
  
But þey conuerted at hir wise lore
wepten ful sore and ȝauen ful credence
Vnto hir word and cryden more and more
Crist goddes sone wiþouten difference
Is verray god þis is al oure sentence 
That haþ so good a seruaunt him to serue
This with oon vois we trowen þough we sterue
Almachius þat herd of þis doynge
Bad fecchen Cecilie þat he might hir se
And alþer first lo þis was his axinge
what maner womman art þou quod he
I am a gentil womman born quod sche
I axe þe quod he though þe it greue
Of þi religioun and of þi byleue 
Ȝe han bygonne ȝour questioun folily
Quod sche þat wolden tuo answers conclude 
In oo demaunde ȝe axen lewedly
Almache answerde to þat similitude
Of whens comeþ þin answering so rude
Of whens quod sche whan sche was Ifreyned
Of conscience and good faith vnfeyned
Almachius sayde takest þou noon heede 
Of my power and sche answerde him þis 
Ȝoure might quod sche ful litel is to drede 
For euery mortal mannes power nys
But lyk a bladder ful of wynd Iwis
For with a nedeles poynt what it is blowe 
May al þe bost of it be layd ful lowe 
  
Ful wrongfully bygan þou quod he 
And ȝet in wrong is þy perseueraunce
wostow nough how oure mighty princes fre

That euery cristen wight schal haue penaunce 
But if þat he his cristendom wiþseye
And goon al quyt if he wil it reneye 
 Ȝoure princes erre as ȝoure nobleye doþ
Quoþ þo Cecilie and with a wood sentence   
Ȝe make vs gulty and it is nouȝt soþ
For ȝe þat knowen wel oure Innocence
For as moche as we doon reuerence 
To crist and for we bere a cristen name
ȝe putten on vs a crym and eek a blame 
But we þat knowen þilke name so
For vertuous we may it not wiþseye
Almache sayde cheese oon of þese tuo
Do sacrifice and cristendom reneye

At which þe holy blisful faire mayde 
Gan for to laughe and to þe Iugge sayde 
O Iugge confus in þis nycete

To make me a wikked wight quod sche 
lo he dissimuleþ heer in audience

To whom almachius sayde vnsely wrecche 
Ne wostow nought how fer my might may strecche
  
Han nought our mighty princes to me yȝiuen
Ȝe bothe power and eek auctorite
To make folk to deyen or to lyuen
why spekestow so proudly þan to me
I speke not but stedefastly quod sche
Nought proudly for I say as for my syde 
we haten deedly þilke vice of pryde
And if þou drede nouȝt a soþ to heere
Than wol I schewe al openly by right
That þou hast maad a ful greet lesyng heere
Thou saist þy princes han Iȝiue þe might
Boþe for to sleen and eek to quike a wight
Thou þat ne maist but oonly lif byreue
Thou hast noon oþer power ne no leue
But þou maist sayn þi princes han þe maked
Minister of deþ for if þou speke of moo
Thow liest for þy power is ful naked
Do way þy lewednes sayd almachius þo
And do sacrifice to oure goddes er þou go  
I recche nought what wrong þat þou me profre 
For I can suffre it as a philosophre
But þilke wronges may I not endure
That þou spekis of oure goddis her quod he
Cecilie answered O nice creature
Thou saydest no word sins þou spak to me 
That I ne knew þerwiþ þy nicete 
And þat þou were in euery maner wise 
A lewed officer a vein Iustise
  
Ther lakketh no þing to þin outer eyen
That þou art blynd for þing þat we seen alle
That it is stoon þat men may wel aspien 
That ilke stoon a god þou wilt it calle 
I rede þe let þin hond vpon it falle 
And tast it wel and stoon þou schalt it fynde
Siþ þat þou seest  not wiþ þin eyȝen blynde
IT is a schame þat þe poeple schal
So scorne þe and laughe at þi folye 
For comunly men woot it wel ouer al
That mighty god is in his heuen hye
And þese ymages wel þou mayst espie
To þe ne to hemself may nought profyte
For in effect þey ben nouȝt worþ a myte
Thise wordes and such oþer sayde sche
And he wax wroþ and bad men schold hir lede
hom to hir hous  and in hir hous quod he 
Brenne hir right in a bath of flammes rede 
And as he bad right so was doon þe dede 
For in a bath þay gonne hir faste schetten
And nyght and day great fuyr þey vnder betten
The longe night and eek a day also
For al þe fuyr and eek þe baþes hete
Sche sat al cold and felte of no woo
Hit made hir not oon drope for to swete
But in þat bath hir lif sche moste lete
For he almachius with ful wikke entente
To sleen hir in þe baþ his sondes sente
  
Thre strokes in þe nek he smot hir þo  
The tormentour but for no maner chaunce 
he might nouȝt smyte hir faire necke atuo 
And for þer was þat tyme an ordinaunce
That no man scholde do man such penaunce
The ferþe strok to smyten softe or sore 
This tormentour ne dorste do no more 
But half deed with hir nekke coruen there
he laft hir lye and on his way he went
The cristen folk which þat about hir were 
wiþ scheetes han þe body ful faire yhent
þre dayes lyued sche in þis torment
And neuer cessed hem þe faith to teche 
That sche had suffred hem sche gan to preche
And hem sche ȝaf hir moebles and hir þing
And to þe pope Vrban bytook hem þo 
And sayd I axe þis of heuen kyng
To haue respit þre dayes and no mo
To recomende to ȝow er þat I go
These soules lo and þat I mighte do wirche

Seynt vrban wiþ his Dekenes priuely
The body fette and buried it by nighte 
Among his oþer seyntes honestely

Seynt vrban halwed it as he wel mighte
In which in to þis day in noble wyse
Men doon to crist and to his seint seruise 
Here endeth þe secounde Nonne hir tale of þe lif of seint Cecilie
Whan ended was þe lif of seynt Cecile
Er we fully had riden fyue myle
At Boughtoun vnder blee vs gan atake
A man þat cloþed was in cloþes blake
And vnder þat he had a whit surplice
his hakeney þat was a pomely grice
So swete þat it wonder was to se
It semed he hadde priked myles þre 
The hors eek þat his ȝyman rood vpon  
So swette þat vnneþes might he goon
Aboute þe peytrel stood þe foom ful hye
he was of foom as flekked as a pye
A male tweyfold on his croper lay
It semed þat he caried litel array
And light for somer rood þis worþy man
And in myn herte wondren I bigan
what þat he was til þat I vnderstood
how þat his cloke was sowed vnto his hood
For which whan I long had auysed me 
I demed him som chanoun for to be
his hat heng at his bak doun by a laas
For he had riden more þan trot or paas 
He had Ipryked lik as he were wood
A cloote leef he had vnder his hood
For swoot and for to kepe his heed from hete
But it was ioye for to se him swete
His forhed dropped as a stillatorie
were ful of plantayn and of peritorie
  
And whanne þat he was com he gan to crie
God saue quod he þis ioly compaignye
Fast haue I priked quod he for ȝour sake 
By cause þat I wolde ȝou atake
To ryden in þis mery companye 
his ȝeman eek was ful of curtesye 
He seid sires now in þe morwe tyde 
Out of ȝour ostelry I saugh ȝou ryde 
And warned heer my lord and my souerayn
which þat to ryden with ȝow is ful fayn
For his desport he loueth daliaunce
Frend for þy warnyng god ȝeue þe good chaunce
Sayde oure host for certes it wolde seme
Thy lord were wys and so I may wel deme
he is ful iocound also dar I leye
Can he ought telle a mery tale or tweye
with which he glade may þis companye
who sire my lord  ȝe ȝe  wiþoute lye 
He can of merthe and eek of Iolite  
Not but ynough also sir trusteþ me
And ȝe him knewe  as wel as do I
ȝe wolde wonder how wel and þriftily
he couþe werke and þat in sondry wise
he haþ take on him many sondry emprise 
which were ful hard for eny þat is heere
To bringe aboute but þay of him it leere 
As homely as he ryt amonges ȝow
If ȝe him knewe it wolde be ȝoure prow
Ȝe nolde nought forgon his aqueyntaunce
For moche good I dar lay in balaunce
Al þat haue in my possessioun
he is a man of heigh discressioun
I warne ȝow wel he is a passyng man
 wel quod our oost I pray þe tel me þan
Is he a clerk  or noon tel what he is
Nay he is gretter þan a clerk Iwis
  
Sayde þe ȝyman and in wordes fewe 
Ost and of his craft somwhat I wil ȝou schewe
I say my lord can such subtilite
But al his craft ȝe may nought wite of me 
And somwhat helpe I ȝit to his worchynge
That al þis ground on which we ben ridynge
Til þat we comen ro Caunterbury toun
he couþe al clene turnen vp so doun
And paue it al of siluer and of gold
And whan þis ȝeman hadde þus Itold
vnto oure oost  he seyde benedicite
This is wonder merueylous to me
Syn þat þis lord is of so heigh prudence
By cause of which men schuld him reuerence 
That of his worchip rekkeþ he so lite
his ouer slop it is not worþ a myte
As in effect to him so mot  I go
It is al bawdy and totore also
why is þi lord so slottisch I þe preye
And is of power better cloþis to beye 
If þat his dede accorde with þy speehe   
Telle me þat and þat I þe biseche 
 why quod þis ȝyman  wherto axe ȝe me
God help me so for he schal neuer þe
But I wol nought avowe þat I say
And þerfor kep it secre I ȝou pray
he is to wys in faith as I bileue
That at is ouerdon it wil nouȝt preue 
a right as clerkes sein it is a vice
wherfore in þat I holde him lewed and nyce
For whan a man haþ ouer greet a witte
Ful ofte him happeth to mysvsen itte
So doth my lord and þat me greueþ sore
God it amende I can say now nomore
Therof no fors good ȝeman quod oure Ost
Syn of þe connyng of þi lord þou wost
  
Tel how he doþ I pray þe hertily
Sin þat he is so crafty and so sly
wher duellen ȝe if it to telle be
In þe subarbes of a toun quod he 
lurking in hirnes and in lanes blynde
wher as þese robbours and þeues by kynde 
holden here prive ferful residence
As þay þat dor nouȝt schewen her presence 
So faren we if I schal say þe soþe
Now quod oure ost ȝit let me talke toþe
why artow discoloured on þy face
Peter quod he god ȝiue it harde grace
I am so vsed in þe fuyr to blowe
That it haþ chaunged my colour I trowe
I am not wont in no mirour to prie
But swynke sore and lerne to multiplie
we blondren euer and pouren in þe fuyr
And for al þat we faile of oure desir
For euer we lacken oure conclusioun
To moche folk we ben illusioun
And borwe gold be it a pound or tuo
Or ten or twelue or many sommes mo
And make hem wenen atte leste weye  
That of a pound we conne make tweye
Ȝit is it fals and ay we han good hope
It for to doon and after it we grope 
But þat science is so fer vs biforn
we mowen nouȝt al þough we had it sworn
It ouertake it slyt away so fast
It wol vs make beggers atte last
Whil þis ȝeman was þus in his talkyng
This chanoun drough him ner and herd al þing
which þat þis ȝiman spak for suspeccioun
Of mennes speche euer hadde þis chanoun
For Catoun saiþ þat he þat gulty is
Demeþ al þing be spoke of him Iwis
  
By cause of þat  he gan so neigh to drawe
his ȝeman þat he herde al his sawe 
And þus he sayd vnto his ȝeman þo
Hold now þi pees and spek no wordes mo
For if þou do þou schalt it deere abye
Thow sclaundrest me here in þis companye
And eek discouerest þat þou schuldest hide
Ȝe quod oure ost tel on what so bytyde
Of alle þis thretyng recche þe nought a myte
In faiþ quod he no more do I but lite
And whan þis chanoun seih it wold not be
But his ȝeman wold telle his priuete
He fledde a way for verray sorwe and schame
A quod þis ȝeman her schal arise game
Al þat I can anoon now wol I telle
Sin he is goon þe foule feend him quelle
For neuer her after wol I wiþ him meete
For peny ne for pound I wol byheete
he þat me broughte first vnto þat game
Er þat he deye sorwe haue he and schame
For it is ernest to me by my fayth
That fele I wel what so eny man saith
And ȝet for al my smert and al my greef
For al my sorwe and labour and mescheef
I couþe neuer leue it in no wise  
Now wolde god my wyt mighte suffise
To tellen al þat longeþ to þat art
But naþeles ȝet wil I telle ȝou part
Sin þat my lord is goon I wol nought spare
Such þing al þat I knowe I wol declare
WIth þis Chanoun I duelled haue seuen ȝer
And of his science am I neuer þe ner
Al þat I hadde I haue lost þer by
And god wot so haþ many mo þan I 
Ther I was wont to be right freisch and gay
Of cloþing and of oþer good array 
Now may I were an hose vpon myn heed
And where my colour was boþe freissch and reed
Now it is wan and of a leden hewe
whoso it vseþ sore schal he rewe
And of my swynk ȝet blended is myn ye
Lo such auauntage it is to multiplie
That slydynge science had me made so bare 
That I haue no good wher þat euer I fare
And ȝit I am endetted so þer by
Of gold I haue borwed trewely
That whil I lyue I schal it quite neuer
lat euery man be war by me for euer
what maner man þat casteþ him þerto
If he continue I holde his þrift Ido
For so help me god þer by schal he not wynne
But empte his purs and make his wittes þynne
And whan he þurgh his madnes and folye 
Haþ lost his owne good in ieupardie 
Than he exciteþ oþer men þerto
To leese her good as he himself haþ do
For vnto schrewes ioye it is and ese 
To haue here felawes in peyne and desese 
  
Thus was I oones lerned of a clerk 
Of þat no charge I wol speke of oure werk
whan we ben þer as we schul exercise
Oure eluyssh craft we seme wonder wyse
Oure termes ben so clergeal and queynte   
I blowe þe fuyr til þat myn herte feynte 
what schulde I telle ech proporcioun
Of þinges which þat we werke vp and doun
As an fyue or six ounces may wel be 
Of siluer or som oþer quantite
And besy me to telle ȝow þe names
Of Orpiment brent bones yren squames
That in to poudre grounden ben ful smal
And in an erthen pot how þat put is al
And salt yput in and also paupere
Biforn these poudres þat I speke of heere
And wel Icouered wiþ a lamp of glas 
And of moche oþer þing what þat þer was
And of þe pot  and glas enlutyng
That of þe aier mighte passe no þing
And of þe esy fuyr and smert also
which þat was maad and of þe care and wo
That we hadde in oure matiers sublymynge
And amalgamynge and calcenynge
Of quyksiluer yclept mercury crude 
For alle oure sleightes we can nought conclude 
Oure orpiment and sublyment mercurie
Oure grounde litarge  eek on þe porfurye
Of ech of þese of ounces a certayn
Nat helpeþ vs oure labour is in vayn
Ne eek oure spirites ascencioun
Ne eek our matiers þat lyn al fix a doun
Mowe in oure werkyng vs no þing auayle
For lost is al oure labour and trauayle
And al þe cost on twenty deuelway
Is lost also which we vpon it lay
  
Ther is also ful many anoþer þing
That is to oure craft appertenyng
Though I by ordre hem here reherse ne can
By cause þat I am a lewed man
Ȝet wil I telle hem as þey come to mynde 
Though I ne conne nought sette hem in her kynde 
As bol armoniak verdegres boras  
And sondry vessels maad of erþe and glas
Oure vrinals and oure descensories

Concurbites and alembikes eeke
And oþere suche deere ynough a leeke
Nat needith it to rehersen hem alle
watres rubisyng and boles galle
Arsnek Sal armoniak and brimstoon
And herbes couþe I telle eek many oon
As Egrimoigne Valirian and lunarie
And oþer suche if þat me list to tarie 
Oure lampes brennyng boþe night and day
To bringe aboute oure craft if þat we may
Oure fournies eek of Calcinacioun
And of watres albificacioun
Vnslekked lym salt and glayre of an ey
Poudres dyuers aissches dong pisse and cley

And dyuers fuyres maad of woode and cole 
Salt tartre alcaly and salt preparat
And combust matieres and coagulat

Of tartre alym glas berm wort and argoyle
Resalgar and oure matiers enbibing
And eek of oure matiers encorporing
And siluer citrinacioun
Oure cementynge and fermentacioun
Oure yngottes testes and many mo
I wol ȝou telle as was me taught also
  
The foure spiritȝ and þe bodies seuen
By ordre as ofte herd I my lord neuen
The firste spirit quyksiluer called is
The secound orpiment þe þridde Iwis
Sal armoniac and þe ferþe bremstoon
The bodies seuen eek lo hem heer anoon
Sol gold is and luna siluer we þrepe
Mars yren Mercurie quyksiluer we clepe
Saturnus leed and Iubiter is tyn  
And Venus coper by my fader kyn
This cursed craft who so wol excercise
he schal no good han þat may him suffise 
For al þe good he spendeþ þer aboute
he lese schal þer of haue I no doute 
whoso þat list outen his folye
let him come forþ and lerne multiplie
And euery man that haþ ought in his cofre
Let him appiere and wexe a philosofre
Ascauns þat craft is so light to lere 
Nay nay god wot al be he monk or frere
Prest Chanoun or eny oþer wight
Though he sit at his book boþe day and night
In lernyng of þis eluysch nice lore
Al is in vayn and parde moche more
Is to lerne a lewed man þis subtilte
Fy spek not þerof for it it wil not be
Al couþe he letterure or couþe he noon
As in effect he schal fynd it al oon
For boþe tuo by my sauacioun
Concluden in multiplicacioun
Iliche wel whan þay han al ydo 
This is to sayn þay fayle boþe tuo
Ȝet forȝat I to moche rehersayle
Of watres corosif and of lymayle
And of bodyes mollificacioun
And also of here enduracioun
  
Oyles ablucioun and metal fusible 
To tellen al wold passen eny bible
That owher is wherfore as for þe best
Of alle þese names now wil I me rest
For as I trowe I haue ȝow told ynowe
To reyse a feend al loke he neuer so rowe 
A nay let be þy philosophre stoon
Elixir clept  we sechen fast echoon
For had we him þan were we syker ynough
But vnto god of heuen I make avow
For al oure craft whan we han al ydo  
And al oure sleight he wol not come vs to
He haþ Imade vs spende moche good
For sorwe of which almost we wexen wood
But þat good hope crepeþ in oure hert
Supposing euer þough we sore smerte 
To ben relieued by him afterward
Supposing and hope is scharp and hard
I warne ȝou wel it is to seken euer
That future temps haþ made men disseuere
In trust þerof from al þat euer þey hadde 
Ȝet of þat art þay conne nouȝt wexe sadde 
For vnto hem it is a bitter swete
So semeþ it for nad þay but a scheete
which þay mighte wrappe hem in a night
And a bak to walke Inne by day light
They wolde hem selle and spenden on þis craft
Thay can nought stinte til no þing be laft
And euermore wher þat euer þey goon
Men may hem knowe by smel of bremston
For al þe world þay stynken as a goot
her sauour is so rammyssch and so hoot
That þough a man fro hem a myle be 
The sauour wol infecte him trusteþ me
Lo þus by smellyng and by þredbare array
If þat men list þis folk þey knowe may 
  
And if a man wol aske hem priuely
why þay ben cloþed so vnþriftily
Right anoon þay rounen in his eere 
And say if þat þay espied were
Men wold hem slee by cause of here science
Lo þus þis folk bytrayen Innocence
Passe ouer þis I go my tale vnto
Er þan þe pot be on þe fuyr ydo
Of metals with a certeyn quantite
My lord hem tempreþ and no man but he
Now he is goon I dar say boldely
For as men sayn he can doon craftily
Algate I wot wel he haþ such a name  
And ȝet ful ofte he renneþ in blame
 And wite ȝe how ful ofte it happeþ so
The pot tobrekeþ and far wel al is goo
These metals been of so gret violence 
Oure walles may not make hem resistence
But if þay were wrought of lym and stoon
Thay percen so and þurgh þe wal þay goon
And some of hem synken in to þe grounde
Thus haue we lost by tymes many a pounde
And some are skatered al þe floor aboute
Some lepe in to þe roof wiþouten doute
Though þat þe feend nought in oure sight him schewe 
I trowe þat he wiþ vs be þat schrewe 
In helle wher þat he is lord and sire
Nis þer no more woo ne anger ne Ire 
whan þat oure pot is broke as I haue sayd
Euery man chyt and halt him euel a payd
Som sayd it was long on þe fuyrmakyng
Some sayde nay it was on þe blowyng
Than was I ferd for þat was myn office 
Straw quod þe þridde  ȝe been lewed and nyce
It was nouȝt tempred as it oughte be 
Nay quod þe ferþe stynt and herkne me 
  
By cause oure fuyr was nought ymaad of Beech
That is þe cause and oþer noon so þeech
I can not telle wheron it was long
But wel I woot gret stryf is vs among
What quod my lord þer is no more to doone 
Of þese periles I wol be war eft soone 
I am right siker þat þe pot was crased
Be as be may be ȝe no þing amased
As vsage is let swoope þe floor as swiþe
Pluk vp ȝour hertes and beþ glad and bliþe
The mullok on an heep Iswoped was
And on þe floor ycast a caneuas
And al þis mulloc in a syue Iþrowe 
And sifted and yplukked many a þrowe
Par de quod oon somwhat of oure metal  
Ȝet is þer heer þough þat we haue nought al
And þough þis þing myshapped haþ a now
Anoþer tyme it may be wel ynow
Vs moste putte oure good in aduenture
A marchaun  par de may not ay endure
Trusteþ me wel in his prosperite
Somtyme his good is drowned in þe see 
And som tyme comeþ it sauf vnto þe londe 
Pees quod my lord þe nexte tyme I wol fonde 
To bringe oure craft al in anoþer plyte
And but I do sire let me haue þe wyte
Ther was defaute in som what wel I woot
Anoþer sayde þe fuyr was ouer hoot
But be it hoot or cold I dar say þis
That we concluden euermor amys
we faile of þat which þat we wolden haue
And in oure madnesse euermore we raue
And whan we ben togideres euerichon
Eueriche man semeþ a Salamon
But al þing which þat schineþ as þe gold 
Is nought gold as þat I haue herd told
  
Ne euery appel þat is fair at ye
Ne is not good what so men clappe or crye
Right so lo fareth it amonges vs
He þat semeþ wisest by Iesus
Is most fool whan it comeþ to þe preef
And he þat semeth trewest is a þeef
That schul ȝe knowe er þa I fro ȝow wende 
By þat I of my tale haue maad an ende 
Ther is a chanoun of religioun
Amonges vs wold infecte al a toun
Though it as gret were as was Niniue
Rome alisaundre troye and oþer þre 
his sleight and his infinite falsnesse 
Ther couþe no man writen as I gesse
Though þat he mighte lyuen a þousand ȝeer
Of al þis world of falsheed nys his peer
For in his termes he wol him so wynde  
And speke his wordes in so sleygh a kynde
whan he comune schal wiþ eny wight
That he wil make him dote anoon right
But it a feend be as himseluen is
Ful many a man hath he bygiled er this
And wol if þat he lyue may a while 
And ȝet men ryde and goon ful many a myle 
Him for to seeke and haue his aqueintaunce 
Nought knowyng of his false gouernaunce
And if ȝow list to ȝeue me audience
I wol it telle here in ȝoure presence
But worschipful chanouns religious
Ne demeþ nought þat I sclaundre ȝoure hous
Al þough my tale of a chanoun be 
Of euery ordre som schrewe is par dee 
And god forbede þat al a companye
Schulde rewe a singuler mannes folye
To sclaundre ȝow is no þing myn entent
But to correcten þat is mys Iment
  
This tale was not oonly told for ȝow
But eek for oþer moo ȝe woot wel how
That among criste apostles twelue 
Ther was no traytour but Iudas himselue
Than why schulde þe remenaunt haue a blame
That gulteles were by ȝow I say þe same
Saue oonly þis if ye wol herkene me
If any Iudas in ȝoure couent be
Remewe him by tyme I ȝow rede 
If schame or los may causen eny drede 
And beþ no þing displesed I ȝou pray
But in þis caas herkeneþ what I say
IN londoun was a prest an annueler
That þer In duelled hadde many a ȝer
which was so plesaunt and so seruisable 
Vnto þe wyf wher as he was at table
That sche wolde suffre him no þing for to pay
For bord ne cloþing went he neuer so gay
And spendyng siluer had he right ynough  
Therof no force I wol procede as now
And telle forþ my tale of þe chanoun
That brought þis prest to confusioun
This false chanoun cam vpon a day
Vnto þe prestes chambre wher he lay
Biseching him to lene him a certeyn
Of gold and he wold quyt hit him ageyn
Lene me a mark quod he but dayes þre 
And at my day I wil it quyte þe 
And if so be þat þou fynde me fals
Anoþer day hong me vp by þe hals
This prest him took a mark and þat as swithe
And þis Chanoun him þankid ofte siþe
And took his leue and wente forþ his wey
And atte þridde day brought his money 
And to þe prest he took þis gold agayn
wherof þis prest was wonder glad and fayn
  
Certes quod he no þing annoyeþ me
To lene a man a noble or tuo or þre
Or what þing were in my possessioun
whan he so trewe is of condicioun
That in no wise he breke wol his day
To such a man I can neuer say nay
what quod þis chanoun schold I be vntrewe
Nay þat were þing Ifallen of þe newe 
Trouþe is a þing þat I wol euer kepe 
Vnto þat day in which þat I schal crepe
In to my graue and elles god forbede 
Bilieueth þis as siker as ȝour crede 
God þank I and in good tyme be it sayd
That þer was neuer man ȝet euel apayd
For gold ne siluer þat he to me lent
Ne neuer falshed in myn hert I ment
And sire quod he now of my priuete
Syn ȝe so goodlich haue be vnto me
And kyþed to me so gret gentilesce
Somwhat to quyte wiþ ȝoure kyndenesse
I wil ȝow schewe and if ȝow lust to lere  

how I kan werken in philosophie
Takith good heed ȝe schul seen wel at ye
That I wol doon a maystry er I go
Ȝe quod þe prest  ȝe sire and wol ȝe so
Mary þer of I pray ȝow hertily
At ȝoure comaundement sire trewely
Quod þe chanoun and elles god forbede
Lo how þis þeef couþe his seruise beede 
Ful soth it is þat such profred seruise
Stynkeþ as witnessen þese olde wise
And þat ful soone I wol it verefye 
In þis chanoun roote of al treccherie
That euermor delit haþ and gladnesse 
Such feendly þoughtes in his hert empresse
  
How cristes poeple he may to meschief bringe
God kepe vs from his fals dissimilynge 
what wiste þis prest wiþ whom þat he delte
Ne of his harm comyng he no þing felte
O seely prest  o sely Innocent 
wiþ coueytise anoon þou schalt be blent
O graceles ful blynd is þy conceyt
No þing art þou war of þe deceyt
which þat þis fox Ischapen haþ to þe
his wily wrenches ywis þou maist not fle
wherfor to go to þe conclusioun
That referreth to þy confusioun
Vnhappy man anoon I wil me hie 
To tellen þin vnwitte and þy folye 
And eek þe falsnesse of þat oþer wrecche 
Als ferforþ as my connyng wol strecche 
This Chanoun was my lord ȝe wolde weene
Sire ost in faith and by þe heuen queene 
It was anoþer chanoun and not he
That can an hundred fold more subtilte
he hath bitrayed folkes many tyme 
Of his falnes it dullith me to ryme
Euer when I speke of his falshede   
For schame of him my cheekes wexen reede
Algates þay bygynne for to glowe 
For reednes haue I noon riȝt wel I knowe 
In my visage for fumes diuerse
Of metals which ȝe han me herd reherse
Consumed and wasted han my reednesse
Now tak heed of þis chanouns cursednesse 
Sir quod he to þe prest let ȝour man goon
For quyk siluer þat we it hadde anoon
And let him bringe ounces tuo or thre 
And whan he comeþ as faste schul ȝe see 
A wonder þing which ȝe saugh neuer er þis
Sire quod þe prest it schal be doon Iwis
  
He bad his seruaunt fecche him his þinges
And he al redy wax at his biddynges
And went him forth and com anoon agayn
wiþ þis quyk siluer schortly for to sayn 
And took þese ounces þre to þe chanoun
And he it layde faire and wel a doun
And bad þe seruaunt coles for to bringe
That he anoon might go to his werkynge
The coles right anoon weren Ifett
And þis chanoun took out a croselett
Out of his bosom and schewed it þe prest
This instrument quod he which þat þou sest
Tak in þin hond and put þiself þer Inne 
Of þis quyksiluer an vnce and her bygynne
In þe name of crist to wax a philosophre 
Ther ben ful fewe whiche þat I wol profre
To schewe hem þus moche of my science
For ȝe schul seen heer by experience
That þis quiksiluer I wol mortifye
Right in ȝoure sight anoon wiþouten lye 
And make it as good siluer and as fyn
As þer is any in ȝoure purs or myn
Or elles wher and make it malleable 
And elles holdeth  me fals and vnable 
Amonges folk for euer to appeere   
I haue a pouder heer þat cost me deere
Schal make al good for it is cause of al
My connyng which þat I ȝou schewe schal
Voydith ȝoure man and let him be þer oute
And schet þe dore whils we ben aboute
Oure priuetee þat no man vs aspye 
whiles we werken in þis philosophie 
Al as he bad fulfilled was in dede 
This ilke seruaunt anoon right out ȝede 
And his maister schitte þe dore anoon
And to here labour speedily þai goon
  
This prest at þis cursed chanouns biddyng
Vppon þe fuyr anoon sette þis þing
And blew þe fuyr and busied him ful fast
And þis chanoun in to þe croslet cast
A pouder noot I wherof þat it was
Imaad ouþer of chalk ouþer of glas
Or som what elles was nouȝt worþ a flye
To blynde wiþ þis prest and bad him hye
These coles for to couchen al aboue
The croislet for in tokenyng I þe loue
Quod þis chanoun þin oughne handes tuo
Schal wirche al þing which þat schal be do
Graunt mercy quod þe prest and was ful glad
And couchede coles as þe chanoun bad
And whil he besy was þis feendly wrecche
This false chanoun þe foule feend him fecche
Out of his bosom took a bechen cole
In which ful subtilly was maad an hole 
And þerIn put was of siluer lymayle 
And vnce and stopped was wiþoute fayle
This hole with wex to kepe þe lymail In 
And vnderstondith þat þis false gyn
was not maad þer but it was maad bifore
And oþer þinges I schal telle more 
Her afterward which þat he with him brought
Er he com þere to bigyle him he þought 
And so he dede er þay wente atwynne  
Til he had torned him couþe he nought blynne 
It dulleþ me whan þat I of him speke 
On his falshede fayn wold I me wreke 
If I wist how but he is heer and þere
he is so variant he byt no where 
But takeþ heed now sires for goddes loue
He took his cole of which I spak aboue 
And in his hond he bar it priuely
And whiles þe preste couched bysily
  
The coles as I tolde ȝow er þis
This chanoun sayde freend ȝe doon amys
This is not couched as it oughte be
But soone I schal amenden it quod he 
Now let me melle þer with but a while 
For of ȝow haue I pitee by seint Gile
Ȝe been right hoot  I se wel how ȝe swete
haue heer a cloþ and wype away þe wete
And whiles þat þis prest him wyped haas
This chanoun took his cole I schrewe his faas
And layd it abouen on þe mydward
Of þe croslet and blew wel afterward
Til þat þe coles gonne faste brenne
Now ȝeue vs drinke quod þe chanoun þenne 
Als swiþe al schal be wel I vndertake
Sitte we doun and let vs mery make 
And whan þe chanouns bechene cole 
was brent al þe lymail out of þe hole
In to þe crosselet anoon fel a doun
And so it moste needes by resoun
Sins it so euen aboue couched was
But þer of wist þe prest no þing allas
He demed alle þe colis Iliche goode
For of þe sleight he no þing vnderstood
And whan þis alcamister saugh his tyme
Rys vp sire prest quod he and stonde byme
And fo I wot wel Ingot haue ȝe noon
Goth walkith forth and brynge a chalkstoon
For I wol make it of þe same schap  
That is an Ingold if I may haue hap 
And bringe with ȝou a bolle or a panne
Ful of water and ȝe schul wel se þanne 
how þat oure besynes schal happe and preue
And ȝit for ȝe schul haue no mysbileeue
Ne wrong conceyt of me in ȝoure absence
I ne wol nought ben out of ȝoure presence 
  
But go with ȝou and come wiþ ȝou agayn
The chambur dore schortly for to sayn
Thay opened and schette and wente forþ here weye
And forth with hem þey caryed þe keye 
And comen agayn wiþouten eny delay 
what schuld I tary al þe longe day
he took þe chalk and schop it in þe wise 
Of an Ingot as I schal ȝow deuyse 
I say he took out of his oughne sleeue
A teyne of siluer euel mot he cheeue
which þat was but an vnce of wight
And takeþ heed now of his cursed slight
he schop his Ingot in lengþe and in brede 
Of þis teyne wiþouten eny drede
So sleighly þat þe prest it nought aspyde
And in his sleeue agayn he gan it hyde 
And fro þe fuyr he took vp his mateere 
And in to þe Ingot put it with mery cheere 
And in to þe watir vessel he it cast
whan þat him list and bad þis prest as fast
Loke what þer is put in þin hond and grope
Thou fynde þer siluer schalt as I hope 
what deuel of helle schold it elles be 
Schauyng of siluer siluer is par de
He putte in his hond and tok vp a teyne
Of siluer fyn and glad in euery veyne
was þis prest whan he saugh it was so
Goddes blessyng and his modres also
And alle halwes haue ȝe sire chanoun
Seyde þe prest and I her malisoun
But and ȝe vouche sauf to teche me  
This nobil craft and þis subtilite
I wil be ȝoure in al þat euer I may
Quod þis chanoun ȝet wol I make assay
The secound tyme þat ȝe mow taken heede
And ben expert of þis and in ȝour neede
  
Anoþer day ȝour self in myn absence
This discipline and þis crafty science
Let take another vnce quod he þo
Of quyksiluer wiþouten wordes mo
And do þer with as ȝe haue doon er þis
wiþ þat oþer which now siluer is
The prest him busyeth in al þat he can
To doon as þis chanoun þis cursed man
Comaunded him and faste blew þe fuyr
For to come to theffect of his desyr
And þis chanoun right in þe mene while
Al redy was þis prest eft to bygile
And for a countenaunce in his hond bar
An holow stikke tak keep and be war
In þende of which an vnce and no more
Of siluer lymail put was as bifore
was in his cole and stopped wiþ wex wel
For to kepe in his limail euery del
And whil þe prest was in his besynesse
This chanoun with his stikke gan him dresse 
To him anoon and his pouder cast In
As he dede er þe deuel out of his skyn
him torne I pray to god for his falshede
For he was euer fals in oth and deede
And wiþ þis stikke alone þe croslet
That was ordeyned wiþ þat false get
He styred þe coles til relente gan
The wex agayn þe fuyr as euery man
But it a fool be woot wel it moot nede 
And al þat in þe hole was out ȝede 
And in to þe creslet hastily it fel

whan þat þis prest thus was begiled agayn1
Supposyng not but trouþe soþ to sayn  
he was so glad þat I can nought expresse 
In no maner his myrþe and his gladnesse
  
And to þe chanoun he profred eft soone
Body and good ȝe quod þe chanoun soone 
Though pore I be crafty þou schalt me fynde 
I warne þe ȝet is þer more byhynde
Is þer any coper her Inne quod he
ȝe sir quod þis prest I trowe þer be
Elles go bye som and þat as swithe
Now goode sire go forth þy way and hythe
he went his way and with þis coper cam
And þis chanoun it in his hondes nam
And of that coper weyed out but an ounce
Al to simple is my tongue to pronounce
The minister and of his witt þe doublenesse 
Of þis chanoun roote of cursednesse
he semed frendly to hem þat knew him nought
But he was fendly boþe in werk and þought
It werieþ me to telle of his falsnesse 
And naþeles ȝit wol I it expresse
To þat entent men may be war þer by
And for noon oþer cause trewely 
he put þis vnce of coper in þe croslet
And on þe fuyr als swithe he haþ it set
And cast in pouder and made þe prest to blowe
And in his worching for to stoupe lowe
As he dede er and al nas but a iape
Right as him list þe prest he made his ape 
And afterward in þe Ingot he it cast
And in þe panne putte it atte last
Of water and in he put his owne hond
And in his sleeue as ȝe byforenhond
herde me telle he had a siluer teyne
he sleyghly took it out þis cursed heyne
Vnwitynge þis prest of his false craft
And in þe pannes botme he haþ it laft
And in þe water rumbleþ to and fro
And wonder priuely took vp also    
The coper teyne nought knowyng þis prest
And hidde it and hent him by þe brest
And to him spak and þus sayde in his game
Stoupeth adoun by god ȝe ben to blame
helpeþ me now as I dede ȝow whil er
Put in ȝour hond and loke what is þer
This prest took vp þis siluer teyne anoon
And þanne sayde þe chanoun let vs goon
wiþ þese þre teynes whiche þat we han wrought
To som goldsmyth and wite if it be ought
For by my faith I nolde for myn hood
But if þey were siluer fyn and good
And þat as swiþe proued schal it be
Vnto þe goldsmith wiþ þese teynes þre
Thay went and putte þese teynes in assay
To fuyr and hamer might no man say nay
But þay were as hem oughte be
This sotted prest who was gladder þan he 
was neuer brid gladder agayn þe day
Ne nightyngale in þe sesoun of may
was neuer noon þat liste better to synge 
Ne lady lustier in carolynge
And for to speke of loue and wommanhede
Ne knyght in armes doon an hardy deede
To stonde in grace of his lady deere
Than hadde þis prest þis craft for to lere
And to þe chanoun thus he spak and seyde
For þe loue of god þat for vs deyde
And as I may deserue it vnto ȝow
what schal þis receyt coste telleþ now
By oure lady quod þe chanoun it is deere
I warne ȝow wel for sire I and a freere
In Engelond þer can man it make 
No fors quoþ he now sire for goddes sake 
what schal I paye telleþ me I pray
Iwis quod he it is ful dere I say
  
Sire at a word if þat ȝe lust it haue
Ȝe schul pay fourty pound so god me saue   
And nere þe frendschipe þat ȝe dede er þis
To me ȝe schulde paye more Iwys
This prest þe somme of fourty pound anoon
Of nobles fette and took hem euerychoon
To þis chanoun for þis ilk receyt
Al his werkyng nas but fraude and deceyt
Sire prest he seyde I kepe haue no loos
Of my craft for I wold it kept were cloos
And as ȝe loueth me kepeþ it secre
For and men knewe  al my sotilte
By god men wolden haue so gret enuye
To me by cause of my philosophie
I schulde be deed þer were noon oþer weye
God it forbede quoþ þe prest what seye
ȝet had I leuer spenden al þe good
which þat I haue and elles wax I wood
Than þat ȝe schulde falle in such meschief
For ȝour good wil sir haue ȝe right good preef
Quoþ þe chanoun· and far wel graunt mercy
he went his way and neuer þe prest him sey
After þis day and whan þat þis prest scholde 
Maken assay at such tyme as he wolde 
Of þis receyt far wel it wold not be 
lo þus byiaped and bygilt was he
Thus makeþ he his introductioun
To bringe folk to here destruccioun
Considereth sires how þat in ech astaat
Bitwixe men and gold þer is debaat
So ferforth þat vnneþe þer is noon
This multiplying blent so many oon
That in good faith I trowe þat it be 
The cause grettest of which skarsete
Philosophres speken so mistyly
In þis craft þat men conne not come þer by
  
For any witt þat men han now on dayes
They may wel chiteren as doon þese iayes
And in here termes sette lust and peyne
But to her purpos schul þay neuer atteyne  
A man may lightly lerne if he haue ought
To multiplie and bringe his good to nought
Lo such a lucre is in þis lusty game
A mannes mirþe it wol torne in to grame 
And empte also grete and heuy purses
And make folk to purchace curses
Of hem þat han her good þerto Ilent
O fy for schame þay þat haue be brent
Allas can þay not fle þe fuyres hete
ȝe þat it vsen I rede ȝe it lete
lest ȝe lesen al for bet þan neuer is late
Neuer to þriue were to long a date 
Though ȝe prolle ay ȝe schul it neuer fynde
Ȝe ben as bolde as is bayard þe blynde
That blundreþ forþ and peril casteth noon
he is as bold to renne agayn a stoon
As for to go bysides in þe wey 
So fare ȝe þat multiplie I sey
If þat ȝoure yȝen can nought seen aright
loke þat ȝoure mynde lakke nought his sight
For þough ȝe loke neuer so brode and stare 
Ȝe schul nought wynne vpon þat chaffare 
But wasten al þat þay may rape and renne
wiþdrawe þe fuyr lest it so faste brenne
Medleþ no more wiþ þat art I mene 
For ȝif ȝe doon ȝoure þrift is goon ful clene
And right as swithe I wol ȝow telle heere
what þat þe philosophres sein in þis mateere 
 lo þus saiþ arnold of þe newe toun
As his Rosarie maketh mencioun
He saith right þus wiþouten eny lye
Ther may no man mercury mortifye
  
But hit be with his broþer knowleching
how þat he which þat first sayd þis þing
Of philosophres fader was hermes
he saiþ how þe dragoun douteles
he dyeþ nought but if þat he be slayn
wiþ his broþer and þat is for to sayn  
By þe dragoun mercury and noon oþer
he vnderstood and brimstoon be his broþer
That out of sol and luna were Idrawe
And þerfore sayde he take heed to my sawe 
Let no man besy him þis art to seche 
But þat he thentencioun and speche 
Of philosophres vnderstonde can
And if he do he is a lewed man
For þis sciens and þis connyng quod he
Is of þe secre of secretȝ par de
Also þer was a disciple of plato
That on a tyme sayde his maister to
As his book somer wil bere witnesse
And þis was his demaunde in sothfastnesse 
Tel me þe name of þe priue stoon
And plato answered vnto him anoon
Take þe stoon þat titanos men name 
which is þat quod he magnasia is þe same
Sayde plato ȝe sire and is it þus
This ignotus per ignotius
what is magnasia good sir I ȝou pray
It is a water þat is maad I say
Of elementes foure quod plato
Telle me þe rooche good sire quod he þo
Of þat water if it be ȝour wille
Nay nay quod plato certeyn þat I nylle
The philosophres sworn were euerich oon
That thay scholde discouere it vnto man noon
Ne in no book it write in no manere 
For vnto crist it is so leef and deere
  
That he wil not þat it discouered be 
But wher it likeþ to his deite 
Man to enspire and eek for to defende
whom þat him likeþ lo þis is þe ende
Than conclude I þus syn god of heuene 
Ne wol not þat þe philosophres neuene 
how þat a man schal come vnto þis stoon
I rede as for þe beste let it goon  
For whoso makeþ god his aduersarie
As for to werke eny þing in contrarie
Vnto his wil certes neuer schal he þriue
Though þat he multiplie terme of al his lyue
And þer a poynt for ended is my tale
God send euery trewe man boote of his bale 
Ther was as telleþ Thitus lyuius
A knight þat cleped was virginieus
Fulfild of honours and of worþines
And strong of frendes and of gret riches
A doughter he hadde by his wyf
And neuer ne hadde he mo in al his lyf
Fair was þis mayde in excellent beaute
Aboue euery wight that men may se
For nature haþ wiþ souereyn diligence
Iformed hir in so gret excellence
As þough sche wolde say lo I nature
þus can I forme and peynte a creature
whan þat me lust who can me counterfete
Pigmalion nouȝt þough he alwey forge and bete 
Or graue or peynte for I dar wel sayn
appollus ȝepherus schulde wirche in vayn
To graue or paynte or forge and bete
If þay presumed me to counterfete
For he þat is þe former principal
haþ maad me his viker general
To forme and peynte erþely creature
Right as me lust al þing is in my cure
Vnder þe moone þat may wane and waxe
And for my werke noþing wol I axe
  
My lord and I ben fully at accord
I made hir to þe worschip of my lord
So do I alle myn oþer creatures
what colour þat þay been or what figures 
Thus semeþ me þat nature wolde say
This mayde was of age twelf ȝer and tway  
In which þat nature haþ suche delite
For right as sche can peynte a lili white
And rody a rose right with such peynture
Sche peynted haþ þis noble creature
Er sche was born vpon her limes fre
were als bright as such colour schulde be
And phebus deyed hadde hire tresses grete
Ilyk to þe stremes of his borned hete
And if þat excellent was hir beaute
A þousand fold more vertuous was sche
And hire ne lakkeþ no condicioun
That is to preyse as by discrecioun
As wel in body as goost chaste was sche
For which sche floured in virginite
with alle humilite and abstinence
with alle attemperaunce and pacience
with mesure eek and beryng of array
Discret sche was in answeryng alway
Though sche were wis pallas dar I sayn
hir facound eek ful wommanly and playn
Noon countrefeted termes hadde sche
To seme wys but after hir degre
Sche spak and alle hire wordes more and lesse
Sovnyng in vertu and in gentilesse
Schamefast sche was in maydenes schamfastnesse
Constant in hert and euer in besynesse
To dryue hire out of hir slogardye
Bachus had of hir mouþ no maistrye
For wille and þought doon venus encrece
As men in fuyr wil caste oyle or grece
  
And of hir oughne vertu vnconstreigned
Sche haþ ful ofte tyme hire seek yfeyned
For þat sche wolde fleen þe companye
wher likly was to treten of folye
As is at festes reueles and at daunces
That ben occasiouns of daliaunces
Such þinges maken children for to be 
To soone rype and bold  as men may se   
which is ful perilous and haþ ben ȝore
For al to soone may sche lerne lore
Of boldenesse whan sche is a wyf
And ȝe maystresses in ȝoure olde lyf
That lordes doughtres han in gouernaunce
Ne takeþ of my word no displesaunce 
Thinges þat ben set in gouernynges
Of lordes douȝtres oonly for tuo þinges 
Ouþer for ȝe han kept ȝour honeste
Oþer elles for ȝe han falle in frelete
And knowe wel ynough þe olde daunce
And conne forsake fully meschaunce
For euermo þerfore for cristes sake 
kepeþ wel þo þat ȝe vndertake
A þeof of venesoun þat haþ forlaft
his licorousnesse and al his theues craft
Can kepe a forest best of eny man
Now kepe hir wel for and ȝe wil ȝe can
loke wel to no vice ȝe assent
lest ȝe be dampned for ȝour wikked entent
For whoso doþ a traytour is certayn
And takeþ keep of þat þat sche schal sayn
Of al tresoun souereyn pestilence
Is whan a wight bytrayeth Innocence
Ȝe fadres and ȝe modres eek also
Though ȝe han children be it oon or mo
Ȝoure is þe charge of al her sufferaunce
whiles þay be vnder ȝour gouernaunce 
  
Beth war þat by ensample of ȝoure lyuynge
Ouþer by necgligence in chastisynge
That þay ne perische for I dar wel seye
If þat þay doon ȝe schul ful sore abeye
vnder a schepherd softe and necligent
The wolf haþ many a schep and lamb torent
Sufficeþ oon ensample now as here
For I moot turne aȝein to my matiere
This mayde of which I telle my tale expresse
So kept hir self hir neded no maystresse  
For in hir lyuyng maydens mighte rede
As in a book euery good word and dede 
That longeþ vnto a mayden vertuous
Sche was so prudent and so bounteous
For þe which out sprong on euery syde 
Boþe of hir beaute and bounte wyde
That þurgh þe lond þay praysed hir ilkoone 
That louede vertu saue enuye alloone 
That sory is of oþer mennes wele 
And glad is of his sorwe and vnhele
The doctor made þis descripcioun
This mayde wente vpon a day in to þe toun
Toward þe temple with hir moder deere
As is of ȝonge maydenes þe manere
Now was þer a Iustice in þe toun
That gouernour was of þat Regioun
And so bifel þis Iuge his eyȝen cast
Vpon þis mayde auysing hir ful fast
As sche cam forby þer þe Iuge stood
Anoon his herte chaunged and his mood
So was he caught wiþ beaute of þis mayde
And to himself ful priuely he sayde
This mayde schal be myn for any man
Anoon þe feend in to his herte ran
And taughte him sodeinly by what slighte
This mayde to his purpos wynne he mighte 
  
For certes by no fors ne by no meede
him þought he was not able for to speede 
For sche was strong of frendes and eek sche
Conformed was in such souerayn bounte
That wel he wist he might hir neuer wynne
As for to make hir with hir body synne
For which wiþ gret deliberacioun
he sent after a clerk was in þe toun
The which he knew for subtil and for bold
This Iuge vnto þe clerk his tale haþ told
In secre wyse and made him to assure
He schulde telle it to no creature  
And if he dede he schulde lese his heed
whan þat assented was þis cursed reed
Glad was the Iuge and made glad cheere 
And ȝaf him ȝiftes precious and deere 
whan schapen was al þis conspiracye 
Fro poynt to poynt how þat his lecherie
Parformed scholde be ful subtilly
As ȝe schul here afterward openly 
hom goþ þis clerk þat highte Claudius
This false Iuge þat highte apius
So was his name for it is no fable
But knowen for a storial þing notable
The sentence of hit soþ is out of doute
This false iugge goþ now fast aboute 
To hasten his delit al þat he may 
And so bifel soone after on a day
This false Iuge as telleþ vs þe story
As he was wont sat in his consistory
And ȝaf his domes vpon sondry caas
This false clerk com forth a ful good paas
And saide lord if þat it be ȝour wille
As doþ me right vpon þis pitous bille
In which I pleyne vpon virgilius
And if he wile seyn it is nouȝt þus
  
I wil proue hit and fynde good witnesse
That soþ is þat my bulle wol expresse 
The Iuge answerd of þis in his absence
I may not ȝiue diffinityf sentence
let do him calle and I wol gladly hiere
Thou schalt haue alle right and no wrong heere
Virginius com to wite þe Iugges wille 
And right anoon was red þis cursed bille
The sentence of hit was as ȝe schul heere
 To ȝow my lord sire apius so deere
Scheweþ ȝoure pore seruaunt Claudius
how þat a knight called Virginius
Aȝeins þe lawe aȝens alle equyte 
holdeth expresse aȝeinst þe wille of me  
My seruaunt which þat my thral is by right
which fro myn hous was stolen on a night
whiles sche was ful ȝong þat wol I preue
By witnesse lord so þat ȝe ȝow not greue
Sche is nought his douȝter what so he say
wherfore to ȝow my lord þe Iugge I pray
Ȝelde me my þrall if þat it be ȝour wille
lo þis was al þe sentence of þe bille
Virgineus gan vpon þe clerk byholde
But hastily er he his tale tolde
he wolde haue proued it as schold a knight
And eek by witnessyng of many a wight
That al was fals þat sayde his aduersarie
This cursed Iuge wold no lenger tarye 
Ne heere a word more of virgineus
But ȝaf his Iugement and saide þus
I deme anoon þis clerk his seruaunt haue
Thou schalt no lenger in þin hous hir haue
Go bringe hir forþ and put hir in oure warde
This clerk schal haue his thral thus I awarde
And whan þis worþy knight virgineus
Thurgh þassent of þis Iuge apius
  
Moste by force his deere douȝter ȝiuen
Vnto þe Iuge in lecchery to lyuen
he goþ him hom and sette him in his halle 
And leet anoon his deere douȝter calle 
And wiþ a face deed as aisshen colde
vpon hir humble face he gan byholde
with fadres pite stiking þorugh his herte
Al wolde he from his purpos not conuerte 
Doughter quod he virginea by þy name
Ther ben tuo weyes eyþer deþ or schame
That þou most suffre allas þat I was bore
For neuer þou deseruedest wherfore
To deyen with a swerd or with a knyf
O deere doughter ender of my lif
which I haue fostred vp with such plesaunce·
That þou nere oute of my remembraunce  
O doughter which  þat art my laste wo
And in þis lif my laste ioye also
O gemme of chastite in pacience
Tak þou þy deth for þis is my sentence
For loue and not for hate þou most be deed
My pitous hond mot smyten of þin heed
Allas þat euer apius þe say
Thus haþ he falsly iugged þe to day
And told hir al þe caas as ȝe bifore
han herd  it nedeth nought to telle it more
Mercy deere fader quod þis mayde
And with þat word sche boþe hir armes layde 
Aboute his nekke as sche was wont to doo
The teeres brast out of hir eyȝen tuo
And sayde goode fader schal I dye
Is ther no grace is þer no remedye
No certeyn deere doughter myn quod he 
Than ȝeue me leue fader myn quod sche 
My deþ for to compleyne a litel space 
For par dy Ieffa ȝaf his douȝter grace
  
For to compleyne er he hir slough allas
And God it woot no þing was hir trespas
But þat sche ran hir fader first to se
To welcome him with gret solempnite
And with þat word a swoun sche fel anoon 
And after whan hir swownyng was agoon
Sche riseþ vp and to hir fader sayde 
Blessed be god þat I schal deye a mayde 
Ȝeue me my deth er þat I haue a schame
Do with ȝour child ȝour wille a goddes name
And with þat word sche prayed him ful ofte
That wiþ his swerd he schulde smyte hir softe
And wiþ þat word on swoune doun sche fel
hir fader with ful sorwful hert and fel
hir heed of smoot and by þe top it hente
And to þe Iuge bigan it to presente
As he sat in his doom in concistory
whan the Iuge it say as saiþ the story  
he bad take him and honge him faste
But right anoon alle þe poeple in þraste 
To saue þe knight for rouþe and for pite
For knowen was þe fals iniquite 
The poeple anoon had suspect in þis þing
By moner of þis clerkes chalengyng
That it was by thassent of apius
That wiste wel þat he was leccherous
For which vnto þis Apius þay goon
And casten him in prisoun right anoon
wher as he slough himself and Claudius
That servaunt was vnto þis Apius
was demed for to honge vpon a tree
But virgineus of his grete pite
Prayde for him þat he was exiled
And elles certes he had ben bigiled
The remenaunt were anhanged more and lesse 
That were consented to þis cursednesse 
  
Her may men se how synne hath his merite
Be war for no man woot how god wol smyte 
In no degre ne in which maner wise
The worm of conscience wol arise
Of wicked lyf þough it so pryue be
That no man woot of it but god and he
wher þat he be lewed man or lered
He not how soone þat he may be afered
Therfore I rede ȝow this counseil take
Forsakith synne  er synne yow forsake
Owre ost gan swere as he were wood
harrow quod he by nayles and by blood
This was a cursed þef a fals Iustice
As schendful deþ as herte can deuise
So falle vpon his body and his boones
The deuel I bykenne him al at oones
Allas to deere boughte sche hir beaute
wherfore I say þat alle men may se  
That ȝiftes of fortune or of nature 
Ben cause of deth of many a creature 
hir beaute was hir deþ I dar wel sayn
Allas so pitously as he was slayn
    
    
But trewely myn owne maister deere
This was a pitous tale for to heere
But naþeles pas ouer þis is no fors
I pray to god to saue þi gentil corps
    
    
And euery boist ful of þi letuarie
God blesse hem and oure lady seinte marie 
So mot I þen þou art a propre man
And ylik a prelat by seint Runyan
Sayde I wel can I not speke in terme
But wel I woot þou dost myn herte erme
I haue almost ycaught a cardiacle
By corpus boones but I haue triacle
Oþer elles a draught of moyst and corny ale
Oþer but I hiere anoon a mery tale
  
Myn hert is brost for pite of þat mayde
Thow pardoner þou belamy he sayde 
Tel vs a tale for þou canst many oon
It schal be doon quod he and þat anoon
But first quod he her at þis ale stake 
I wil first drynke and byt on a cake
But right anoon þe gentils gan to crie
Nay let him tellen vs no ribaudye
Tel vs som moral þing þat we may leere 
Gladly quod he and sayde as ȝe schal heere
But in þe cuppe wil I me beþinke
vpon some honest tale whil I drinke 
LOrdyngs quod he in chirche whan I preche
I peyne me to haue an hauteyn speche 
And ryng it out as lowd as doþ a belle
For I can al by rote þat I telle
My teeme is alway oon and euer was
Radix omnium malorum est Cupiditas
First I pronounce whennes þat I come
And þanne my bulles schewe I alle and some  
Oure liege lordes seal vpon my patent
That schewe I first my body to warent
That no man be so hardy prest ne clerk
Me to destourbe of cristes holy werk
And after þat þan tel I forth my tales
Bulles of popes and of Cardynales 
Of patriarkes and of bisshops I schewe
And in latyn speke I wordes fewe 
To sauore with my predicacioun
And for to stere hem to deuocioun
Thanne schewe I forth my longe cristal stoones
Icrammed ful of cloutes and of boones
Reliks þay ben as wene þei echoon
Than haue I in latoun a schulder boon
which þat was of an holy Iewes scheep
Good men say I tak of my wordes keep
If þat þis boon be waische in eny welle 
If cow or calf or scheep or oxe swelle
That eny worm haþ ete or worm Istonge
Tak water of þat welle and waisch his tonge
  
And it is hool anoon and forþermore
Of pokkes and of scabbe and euery sore 
Schal euery scheep be hool þat of þis welle
That drynketh a draught tak heed eek what I telle
If þat þe goode man þat þe beest oweþ
wol euery wike er þat þe cok him croweþ
Fastynge drynke  of þis welle a draught
As þilke holy Iew oure eldres taught
His beestes and his stoor schal multiplie
And sires also it kelith Ialousie
For þough a man be ful in ialous rage
let make wiþ þis water his potage
And neuer schal he more his wyf mys trist
þough he þe soþ of hir defaute wist
Al hadde sche take prestes tuo or þre
her is a meteyn eek þat ȝe may see
he þat his honde put in þis metayn
he schal haue multiplying of grayn  
whan he haþ sowen be it whete or otes
So þat ȝe offre pans or elles grootes
And men and wommen oon þing warne I ȝow
If eny wight be in þis chirche now
That haþ doon synne orrible þat he
Dar nought for schame of it schryuen be
Or ony womman be sche ȝong or old
That hath ymaad hir housbond cokewold
which folk schal haue no power ne grace
To offre to my relikes in þis place
And who so fint him out of suche blame
Thay wol come vp and offre in goddes name
And I assoile hem by þe auctorite
which þat by bulle was Igraunted me
By þis gaude haue I wonne euery ȝeer
An hundred mark syn I was pardoner
I stonde lik a clerk in my pulpit
And whan þe lewed poeple is doun Iset
  
I preche so as ȝe haue herd bifore
And telle hem an hondred Iapes more
Than peyne I me to strecche forþ my necke
And est and west vpon þe poeple I bekke
As doþ a dowfe syttyng on a berne
Myn hondes and my tonge goon so ȝerne
That it is ioye to se my busynesse
Of auarice and of such cursednesse
Is al my preching for to make hem fre
To ȝeue here pans and namely vnto me
For myn entent is nought but for to wynne
And no þing for correccioun of synne
I rekke neuer when þay ben Iberyed
Though þat here soules gone a blakeberyed
For certes many a predicacioun
Comeþ ofte tyme of euel entencioun
Som for plesauns of folk and flaterie
To ben auaunced by ypocrisie
And som for veine gloir and som for hate
For whan I dar not oþer weys debate  
Than wil I stynge him with my tonge smerte
In preching so þat he schal not astert
To be diffamed falsly if þat he
haþ trespast to my breþeren or to me
For þough I telle not his propre name
Men schal wel knowe þat it is þe same 
By signes and by oþer circumstaunces
Thus quyt I folk þat doon vs displesaunces
Thus put I out my venym vnder hiewe
Of holynes to seme holy and trewe 
But schortly myn entent I wol deuyse
I preche no þing but of coueityse
Therfor my teem is ȝit and euer was
Radix omnium malorum est Cupiditas
Thus can I preche agayn þe same vice
which þat I vse and þat is auarice
  
But though my self be gulty in þe synne
Ȝit can I make oþer folk to twynne 
From auarice and soone to repent
But þat is not my principal entent
I preche no þing but for coueitise
Of þis matier it ought Inough suffise
Than telle I hem ensamples many oon
Of olde þinges longe tyme agoon
For lewed poeple louen tales olde
which þinges can þay wel report and holde 
what trowe ȝe whiles I may preche
And wynne gold and siluer for I teche
That I wil lyue in pouert wilfully
Nay nay I þought it neuer trewly
For I wol preche and begge in sondry londes
I wil do no labour wiþ myn hondes
Ne make basketis and lyue þer by
By cause I wil nought begge ydelly
I wol noon of thapostles counterfete
I wol haue money wolle chese and whete 
Al were it ȝeuen of þe prestes page
Or of þe porest wydow in a village  
And schold hir children sterue for famyn
Nay I wol drinke licour of þe wyn
And haue a ioly wenche in euery toun
But herkneþ lordynges my conclusioun
Ȝoure likyng is þat I schal telle a tale
Now haue I dronk a draught of corny ale 
By god I hope I schal telle ȝow a þing
That schal by resoun be at ȝour liking
For þough myself be a ful vicious man
A moral tale ȝit I ȝow telle can
which I am wont to preche for to wynne
Now hold ȝour pees my tale I wol byginne
IN Flaundres whilom was a companye 
Of ȝonge folkes þat haunted folye
As ryot hasard stywes and tauernes
wher as wiþ lutes harpes and gyternes
Thay daunce and play at dees boþe day and night
And ete also and drynk ouer her might
Thurgh which þay doon þe deuyl sacrifise
wiþinne þe deueles temple in cursed wise
By superfluite abhominable
her othes been so greet and so dampnable
That it is grisly for to hiere hem swere
Our blisful lordes body þay totere
hem þoughte Iewes rent him nouȝt ynough
And ech of hem at oþeres synne lough
And right anoon þer come tombesteris
    
    
Whiche þat ben verray þe deueles officeres
To kyndle and blowe þe fuyr of leccherie
Þat is anexid vnto glotonye
The holy wryt take I to my witnesse
That luxury is in wyn and dronkenesse
lo how þat dronken loth vnkyndely
lay by his doughtres tuo vnwityngly
So dronk he was he niste what he wrought
herodes whoso wel þe story sought
    

  
whan he of wyn was repleet at his fest  
Right at his oughne table ȝaf his hest
To sle þe baptist Iohn ful gilteles
Seneca seiþ a good word douteles
he saiþ he can no difference fynde
Bituyx a man þat is out of his mynde
And a man þe which is dronkelewe
But þat woodnes fallen in a schrewe
Perseuereth lenger þan doth dronkennesse
O glutonye ful of corsidnesse
O cause first of oure confusioun
O origiual of oure dampnacioun
Til crist had bought out wiþ his blood agayn
lo how dere schortly for to sayn
Abought was first þis cursed felonye
Corupt was al þis world for glotonye
Adam our fader and his wyf also
Fro paradys to labour and to wo
were dryuen for þat vice it is no drede
For whils þat adam fasted as I rede
he was in paradis and whan þat he
Eet of þe fruyt defendit of a tre
he was out cast to wo and into peyne
O glotony wel ought vs on þe pleyne
O wist a man how many maladyes
Folwith of excesse and of glotonyes
he wolde be þe more mesurable
Of his diete sittyng at his table
Allas þe schorte þrote þe tendre mouþ
Makeþ þat Est West north and south
In erþe in watir in ayer man to swynke
To gete a sely glotoun mete and drynke
Of þis matier o poul wel canstow trete
Mete vnto wombe and wombe vnto mete
Schal god destroyen boþe as powel saiþ
Allas a foul þing is it by my faiþ
  
To say þis word  and fouler is þe dede
whan men so drynke  of þe whyt and rede
That of his þrote he makiþ his priue  
Thurgh þilke cursed superfluite
Thapostil wepyng saiþ ful pitously
Ther walkith many of which ȝou told haue I
I say it now wepyng wiþ pitous vois
Thay are enemys of cristes croys 
Of which þe ende is deth wombe is her god
O wombe  o bely o stynkyng is þi cod
Fulfild of dong  and of corrupcioun
At eyþer ende of þe foul is þe soun
how gret cost  and labour is þe to fynde 
These cokes how þey stamp and streyn and grynde 
And torne substaunce in to accident
To fulfille  þy licorous talent
Out of þe harde boones gete þay
The mary for þay caste nouȝt away
That may go þurgh þe golet softe and soote
Of spicery and leuys bark and roote
Schal ben his sauce maad to his delyt
To make him haue a newe appetit
But certes he þat haunteþ suche delices
Is deed þer whiles þat he lyueþ in vices
A licorous þing is wyn and dronkenesse
Is ful of stryuyng and of wrecchednesse
O dronke man disfigured is þi face
Sour is þi breþ foul artow to embrace
And þurgh þi dronkenesse sowneþ þe soun
As þough þou seydest ay Sampsoun Sampsoun
And ȝit god wot sampson drank neuer wyn
Thou fallist as it were a stiked swyn
Thy tonge is lost and al þin honest cure
For dronkenes is verray sepulture
Of mannes witt and his discrecioun
In whom þat drynk haþ dominacioun
  
He can no counseil kepe it is no drede
Ne keep ȝow from þe white and from þe rede
Namely fro þe white wyn of leepe
That is to selle in Fleetstreet or in Chepe
This wyn of Spayne crepith subtily  
In oþer wynes growyng faste by
Of which þer riseth such fumosite 
That whan a man hath dronke draughtes þre 
And weneth þat he be at hom in Chepe
He is in Spayne rightat þe toun of lepe 
Nought at þe Rochel ne at Burdeaux toun
And þanne wol þai say Sampsoun Sampsoun
But herken lordyngs o word I ȝou pray 
That alle þe souerayn actes dar I say
Of victories in þe olde testament
That þorugh þe verray god omnipotent
were doon in abstinence and in prayere 
Lokith þe bible and þer ȝe may it hiere
Loke atthila þe grete conquerour
Deyd in his sleep with schame and dishonour
Bleedyng ay at his nose in dronkenesse 
A captayn schuld ay lyue in sobrenesse
And ouer al this aryse ȝow right wel
what was comaunded vnto lamuel
Nought samuel but lamuel say I
Redith þe bible and fyndeþ expresly
Of wyn ȝeuyng  to hem þat han Iustice
No more of þis for it may wel suffice
And now I haue Ispoke of glotonye 
Now wil I ȝow defende hasardrye
 Hasard is verray moder of lesynges
And of deceipt of cursed forsweringes
Blaspheme of crist manslaught and wast also 
Of catel and of tyme forther mo
It is reproef and contrair to honour
For to be halde a comun hasardour
  
And euer þe heyer he is of astaat
The more is he holden desolaat
If þat a prince vse hasardrie
In alle gouernance and policie
He is as by comun opinioun
Holde þe lasse in reputacioun
Stilbon þat was Iholde a wis embasitour  
was sent in to Corinthe with gret honour
Fro lacidome to make hir alliaunce
And whan him cam him happede par chaunce 
That alle þe grettest þat were of þat lond 
Playing atte hasard he hem fond
For which as soone as it mighte be
He stal him hoom aȝein to his contre
And saide ther I nyl nouȝt lese my name
I nyl not take on me so gret diffame
Ȝow for to allie vnto noon hasardoures 
Sendeth oþerwise embasitoures
For by my trouþe me were leuer dye
Than I ȝow scholde  to hasardours allye 
For ȝe þat ben so glorious in honoures
Schal not allie ȝow with hasardoures
As by my wil  ne as by my trete
This wise philosophre þus sayd he
lo eek þat þe king Demetrius
The king of Parthes as þe saith vs
Sent him a paire dees of gold in scorn
For he had vsed tauern þer toforn
For which he hield his gloir and his renoun
At no valieu or reputacioun
Lordes may fynde oþer maner play
Honest ynough to dryue away þe day
Now wol I speke of oþes fals and grete 
A word or tuo as oþer bookes entrete
Gret swering is a þing abhominable
And fals swering is more reprouable
  
The hyhe god forbad sweryng at al 
witnes on Mathew but in special
Of sweryng saith þe holy Ieremye
Thou schalt say soth þin oþes and not lye
And swere in doom and eek in rightwisnes
But ydel sweryng is a cursednes
Bihold and se þer in þe firste table
Of hihe goddes heste honurable 
How þat þe secounde heste is this  
Tak not in ydel ne his name amys
Lo he rather forbedith such sweryng
Than homicide or many a corsed þing
I say as by order þus it stondith
This knoweth he þat þe hestes vnderstondeth
how þat þe second hest of god is that
And forþermore I wol þe telle a plat
The vegance schal not parte fro his hous
That of his othes is outrageous
By goddes precious hert and by his nayles
And by þe blood of crist þat is in hayles
Seuen is my chaunce and also cink and tray
By goddis armes and þou falsly play
This daggere schal þurgh þin herte goo
This fruyt comeþ of þe bicchid boones tuo
Forswering Ire  falsnes homicide 
Now for þe loue of crist þat for vs dyde
leueth ȝoure othis boþe gret and smale
But sires now wol I telle forþ my tale
These riottours þre  of which I ȝou telle
longe erst þan prime rong eny belle
were set hem in a tauern for to drynke
And as þay sat þay herd a belle clinke
Biforn a corps was caried to þe graue
That oon of hem gan calle vnto his knaue
Go bet quoþ he and axe redily
what corps is þat passeth her forþ by
  
And loke þou report his name wel
Sire quod he but þat nedeþ neuer a del
It was me told er ȝe com heer tuo houres
He was par dy an old felaw of ȝoures
And sodeinly he was Islayn to night
Fordronk as he sat on his bench vpright
Ther com a priue thef men clepen deth
That in þis contre al þe peple sleth
And with his spere he smot his hert a tuo
And went his way wiþoute wordes mo
he haþ a þousand slayn þis pestilence  
And maister er ȝe come in his presence 
Me þinkeþ þat it is ful necessarie 
For to be war of such an aduersarie
Beþ redy for to meete him euermore
Thus taughte me my dame I say nomore
By seinte mary sayde þe tauerner
The child saiþ soþ for he haþ slayn þis ȝeer
Hens ouer a myle wiþinne a gret village
Boþe man and womman child and page
I trowe his habitacioun be þere
To ben auysed gret wisdom it were
Er þat he dede a man þat dishonour
ȝe goddis armes quod þis ryottour
Is it such peril with him for to meete 
I schal him seeke by way and eek by strete
I make avow to goddis digne boones
Herkneþ felaws we þre ben al oones
let ech of vs hold vp his hond to other
And ech of vs bycome oþeres broþer
And we wil slee þis false traitour deth
He schal be slayne that so many sleeth
By goddis dignete er it be night
Togideres han þese þre here trouþes plight
To lyue and deye ech of he wiþ oþer
As þough he were his oughne sworne broþer
  
And vp þai startyn al dronke in þis rage 
And forþ þai goon towardes þat village
Of which þe tauerner haþ spoke biforn
And many a grisly oth þan han þay sworn
And cristes blessed body þay torent
Deth schal be deed if þat þay may him hent
Right as þay wolde haue torned ouer a style
whan þai han goon nought fully a myle
An old man and a pore with hem mette
This olde man ful mekely hem grette 
And saide þus lordynges god ȝow se
The proudest of þe ryotoures þre
Answerd aȝein what carle wiþ meschaunce  
why artow al forwrapped saue þi face
whi lyuest þou in so gret an age
This olde man gan loke on his visage
And saide þus for þat I can not fynde 
A man þough þat I walke in to Inde
Neiþer in Cite noon ne in village
That wol chaunge his ȝouþe for myn age
And þerfore moot I haue myn age stille 
As longe tyme as it is goddes wille
And deth allas ne wil not haue my lif
Thus walk I lik a resteles caytif
And on þe ground which is my modres gate
I knokke with my staf erly and late
And saye leeue moder let me In
Lo how I wane fleisch and blood and skyn
Allas whan schuln my boones ben at rest
Moder with ȝow wil I chaunge my chest
That in my chamber longe tyme haþ be
Ȝe for an haire clout to wrap in me
But ȝet to me sche wil not do þat grace
For which ful pale and welkid is my face
But sires to ȝow it is no curtesye
To speke vnto an old man vilonye
  
But he trespas in word or elles dede
In holy writ ȝe may ȝour self wel rede
Aȝens an old man hoor vpon his hede
Ȝe schold arise wherefor I ȝow rede 
Ne doth vnto an old man more harm now
Na more þan ȝe wolde men dede to ȝow
In age  if þat ȝe may so long abyde
And god be with ȝou  wher so ȝe go or ryde
I moot go þider as I haue to goo
Nay olde cherl by god thou schalt not so
Sayde þat oþer hasardour anoon
Thou partist nouȝt so lightly by seint Iohn
Thou spak right now of þat traytour deþ  
That in þis contre alle oure frendes sleþ
Haue her my trouth as þou art his aspye 
Tel wher he is or elles þou schalt dye 
By god and by þat holy sacrament
For soþly þou art oon of his assent
To schewe vs ȝonge folk þe false theef
Now sires þan if þat ȝow be so leef
To fynde deþ torn vp þis croked way
For in þat groue I laft him by my fay
Vnder a tree and þer he wil abyde
Ne for ȝour bost he nyl him no þing hyde
Se ȝe þat ook right þer ȝe schuln him fynde
God saue ȝow þat bought aȝein mankynde
And ȝow amend þus sayde þis olde man
And euerich of þese riotoures ran
Til þay come to the tre and ther þay founde
Of florins fyn of gold ycoyned rounde
wel neygh a seuen busshels as me thought
No lenger þanne after deþ þay sought
But ech of hem so glad was of þat sight
For þat þe florens so faire were and bright
That doun þai sette hem by þat precious hord
The ȝongest of hem spak þe firste word
  
Breþeren takeþ keep what I schal say
My witte is gret þough þat I bourde and play
This tresour haþ fortune to vs ȝiuen
In mirth and iolyte our lif to lyuen
And lightly as it comth so wil we spende
Ey goddis precious dignite who wende
To day þat we schuld haue so fair a grace
But might þis gold be caried fro þis place
Hom to myn hous or ellis vnto ȝoures
For wel I wot þat þis gold is nouȝt oures
Than were we  in heyh felicite
But trewely by day it may not be
Men wolde say þat we were þeues stronge 
And for oure tresour doon vs for to honge
This tresour moste caried be by night  
As wysly and as slely as it might
wherfore I rede þat cut among vs alle
Be drawe and let se wher þe cut wil falle
He þat haþ þe cut wiþ herte bliþe
Schal renne to þe toun and þat ful swithe
To bring vs bred and wyn ful priuely
And tuo of vs schal kepe subtilly
This tresour wel and if he wil not tarie
whan it is night we wol þis tresour carie
By oon assent þer as vs likeþ best
That oon of hem þe cut brought in his fest
And bad hem drawe and loke wher it wil falle
And it fel on þe ȝongest of hem alle 
And forþ toward þe toun he went anoon
And al so soone as he was agoon
That oon of hem  spak vnto þat oþer
Thow wost wel þat þou art my sworne broþer
Thy profyt wol I  telle þe anoon
Thow wost wel þat our felaw is agoon
And her is gold and þat ful gret plente
That schal departed be among vs þre 
  
But naþeles if I can schape it so
That it departed were bitwix vs tuo
had I not doon a frendes torn to þe 
That oþer answerd I not how þat may be
he wot wel þat þe gold is wiþ vs tway
what schulde we þan do what schuld we say
Schal it be counsail sayde þe ferste schrewe
And I schal telle þe in wordes fewe 
what we schul doon and bringe it wel aboute
I graunte quod þat other wiþoute doute
That by my trouþe I wil þe nought bywray
Now quod þe first þou wost wel we ben tway
And two of vs schuln strenger be þan oon
lok whanne he is sett and þat anoon
Arys as þou woldest with him pleye
And I schal ryf him thurgh þe sydes tweye
whils þou strogelest wiþ him as in game  
And with þi dagger loke þou do þe same
And þan schal al þe gold departed be
My dere frend bitwixe þe and me
Than may we oure lustes fulfille
And play at dees right at our owne wille
And þus accorded ben þese schrewes twayn
To sle þe þridde  as ȝe herd me sayn
This ȝongest which þat wente to þe toun
Ful fast in hert he rollith vp and doun
The beaute of þe florins newe and bright
O lord quod he if so were þat I might
Haue al þis gold vnto my self alloone
Ther is no man þat lyueth vnder þe troone
Of gold þat schulde lyue so mery as I
And atte last þe feend oure enemy
Put in his þought þat he schuld poysoun beye
wiþ which he mighte sle his felaws tweye
Forwhy þe feend fond him in such lyuynge
That he had leue to sorwe him to brynge
  
For þis witterly  was his entent
To slen hem boþe and neuer to repent
And forth he goþ no lenger wold he tary
In to þe toun vnto a potecary 
And prayde him þat he him wolde selle
Som poysoun þat he might his rattis quelle
And eek þer was a polkat in his hawe 
As he sayde his capouns had Islawe 
And said he wold him wreke if þat he might
On vermyn þat destroyed him by night
Thapotecary answerd and þou schalt haue
A þing þat also god my soule saue
In al þis world þer nys no creature
That ete or dronk had of þis confecture
Nought but þe mountaunce of a corn of whete
That he ne schuld his lif anoon forlete 
Ȝe sterue he schal and þat in lasse while
Than þou wilt goon a paas not but a myle 
The poysoun is so strong and violent  
This cursed man haþ in his hond Ihent
This poysoun in a box and sins he ran
In to þe nexte stret vnto a man
And borwed him large botels þre
And in þe two his poysoun poured he
The þrid he keped clene for his drynke
For al þe night he schop him for to swynke
In carying the gold out of þat place
And whan þis riotour with sory grace
had fillid with wyn his botels þre
To his felaws aȝein repaireth he
what nedith it to sermoun it more
For right as þay had cast his deth bifore
Right so þay han him slayn and þat anoon
And whan þis was Idoon þan spak þat oon
Now let vs drynk and sitte and make vs mery
And siþþen we wil his body bery
  
And afterward it happed hem par cas
To take þe botel þer þe poysoun was
And drank and ȝaf his felaw drink also
For which þay sterued boþe tuo
But certes I suppose þat amycen
wrot neuer in Canoun ne in non fen
Mo wonder sorwes of empoisonyng
Thus hadde þese wrecches tuo here endyng
Thus endid been þese homicides tuo
And eek þe fals empoysoner also 
O cursed synne ful of cursednesse
O traytorous homicidy o wikkednesse
O glotony luxurie and hasardrye 
Thou blasphemour of crist with vilanye
And oþes grete of vsage and of pride
Allas mankynde how may it bytyde
Ther to þy creatour which þat þe wrought
And wiþ his precious herte blood þe bought
Thou art so fals and so vnkynde allas
Now good men god forȝeue ȝow ȝour trespas
And ware ȝow fro þe synne of auarice  
Myn holy pardoun may ȝou alle warice
So þat ȝe offren noblis or starlinges
Or elles siluer spones broches or rynges
Bowiþ ȝour hedes vnder þis holy bulle
Comeþ forþ ȝe wyues and offreþ ȝour wolle
Ȝour names I entre her in my rolle anoon
In to þe blis of heuen schul ȝe goon
I ȝow assoile by myn heyh power
If ȝe woln offre as clene and eek als cler
As ȝe were born  and sires lo þus I preche 
And Ihū crist þat is oure soules leche
So graunte ȝow his pardoun to receyue
For þat is best I wil not ȝow disceyue
But sires o word forȝat I in my tale 
I haue reliks and pardoun in my male 
  
As fair as eny man in Engelond
which were me Iȝeue by popes hond
If eny of ȝow wol of deuocioun
Offren and haue myn absolucioun
Cometh forth anon knelith her adoun
And ȝe schul haue here my pardoun
Or elles takith pardoun as ȝe wende
Al newe and freissch at euery townes ende
So þat ȝe offren alway new and newe 
Nobles and pens which þat ben good and trewe 
It is an honur to euery þat is heer
That may haue a suffisaunt pardoner
Tassoile ȝow in contre as ȝe ryde
For auentures which þat may bytyde
For paraunter· þer may falle oon or tuo
Doun of his hors and breke his nekke atuo
loke such a seurete is to ȝou alle
That I am in ȝour felaschip Ifalle
That may assoyle ȝou boþe more and lasse
whan þat þe soule schal fro þe body passe
I rede þat oure hoste schal bygynne
For he is most enuoliped in synne
Com forþ sire ost and offer first anoon  
And þou schalt kisse þe reliquis euerichoon
Ȝe for a grote vnbocle þi purs
Nay nay quod he þan haue I cristes curs
let be quod he it schal not be so theech
Thou woldest make me kisse þin olde breech
And swere it were a relik of a seynt
Though it were wiþ þi foundement depeynt
But by þe cros which þat seynt heleyn fond
I wold I had þy coylons in myn hond
In stede of reliks or of seintuary 
let cut hem of I wol help hem to cary
Thay schul be schryned in an hogges tord
This pardoner answerde nat o word
  
So wroþ he was he wolde no word say
Now quod oure host I wol no lenger play
wiþ þe ne with noon oþer angry man
But right anoon þis worthy knight bygan
whan þat he saugh þat al þe peple lough
No more of þis for it is right ynough
Sir pardoner be glad and mery of cheere
And ȝe sir host þat ben to me so deere
I pray ȝow þat ȝe kisse þe pardoner
And pardoner I pray ȝow draweþ ȝow ner
And as we dede let vs laugh and play
Anoon þay kisse and riden forþ her way 
A Marchaunt whilom dwelled at seint Denys
That riche was for which men hild him wys
A wyf he had of excellent beaute
And companable and reuerent was sche
which is a þing þat causeth more despence
Than worth is al þe cher and reuerence
That men doon hem at festes or at daunces
Such salutaciouns and continaunces
Passeth as doþ þe schadow on a wal
But wo is him þat paye moot for al
The sely housbond algat moste pay  
He most vs cloþe  in ful good array
Al for his oughne worschip richely
In which array we daunce iolily
And if þat he may not parauenture
Or elles wil not such dispens endure
But þynkeþ it is wasted and Ilost
Than moot anoþer paye for oure cost
Or lene vs gold and þat is perilous
The worþy marchaunt huld a noble hous
For which he hadde alday gret repair
For his largesce and for his wyf was fair
what wonder is but herkneþ to my tale
Amonges al þese gestes gret and smale 
Ther was a monk a fair man and a bold
I trowe þritty wynter he was old
That euer in oon was drawyng to þat place 
This ȝonge monk þat was so fair of face
  
Aqueynted was so wiþ þe goode man
Siþ þat her firste knowleche bygan
That in his hous as familier was he 
As it possibil is a frend to be
And for as mochil as þis goode man
And eek þis monk of which þat I bygan
were boþe tuo Iborn in oon village 
The monk him claymeth as for cosynage
And he aȝein he saith nat oones nay
But was as glad þer of as foul of day
For to his hert it was a gret plesaunce 
Thus ben þay knyt wiþ eterne alliaunce
And ilk of hem gan oþer to assure 
Of broþerhed whil þat her lif may dure
Fre was daun Iohn and manly of despence 
As in þat hous and ful of diligence
To do plesaunce and also gret costage
He nought forȝat to ȝeue þe leste page
In al þat hous but after her degre 
He ȝaf þe lord and siþþen þe meyne 
whan þat he com som maner honest þing  
For which þay were as glad of his comyng
As foul is fayn  whan þat þe sonne vpriseþ
No mor of þis as now for it suffiseþ
But so bifel þis marchaunt on a day 
Schop him to make redy his array 
Toward þe toun of Bruges for to fare 
To byen þer a porcioun of ware
For which he hath to paris sent anoon
A messanger and prayed had dan Iohn
That he schuld come to seint Denys and play
with him and wiþ his wyf a day or tway
Er he to brigges went  in alle wise
This nobil monk of which I ȝow deuyse
Haþ of his abbot as him list licence
By cause he was a man of heih prudence
  
And eek an officer out for to ryde 
To se her graunges and her bernes wyde 
And vnto seint denys he comeþ anoon
who was so welcome as my lord dan Iohn
Oure deere cosyn ful of curtesie 
with him brought he a Iubbe of maluesie
And eek anoþer ful of wyn vernage
And volantyn as ay was his vsage
And þus I lete hem ete and drynk and play
This marchaunt and þis monk a day or tway
The þridde day þis marchaund vp he riseth
And on his needes sadly him auyseth
And vp in to his countour hous goþ he
To rekyn wiþ himself as wel may be 
Of þilke ȝer how þat it with him stood
And how þat he dispended had his good
And if þat he encresced were or noon
His bookes and his bagges many oon
He haþ byforn him on his counter bord
For riche was his tresor and his hord
For which ful fast his countour dore he schette
And eek he wolde no man schold him lette
Of his accomptes for þe mene tyme   
And þus he sat til it was passed prime
Dan Iohn was risen in þe morn also
And in the gardyn walkith to and fro
And haþ his þinges said ful curteisly
This good wyf com walkyng ful priuely
In to a gardyn þer he walkeþ softe
And him salueþ as sche haþ doon ful ofte
A mayde child com in hir compaignie
which as hir list sche may gouerne and gye
For ȝit vnder þe ȝerde was þe mayde
O dere cosyn myn dan Iohn sche sayde
what ayleþ ȝow so raþe to arise
Nece quod he it aught ynough suffise
  
Fyue houres for to slepe a night
But it were for eny old palled wight
As ben þese weddid men þat lye and dare
As in a forme liþ a wery hare
were al forstraught with houndes gret and smale
But dere nece why be ȝe so pale 
I trowe certis þat oure goode man
hath on ȝow laborid sith þe night bygan
That ȝow were nede to resten hastiliche
And with þat word he lowgh ful meriliche
And of his owne þought he was al reed
This faire wyf bygan to schake hir heed
And sayde þus ȝe god wot al quod sche 
Nay cosyn myn it stant not so wiþ me
For by þat god þat ȝaf me soule and lif
In al þe reme of Fraunce is þer no wif
That lasse lust haþ to þat sory play
For I may synge  allas and waylaway
That I was born but to no wight quod sche
Dar I not telle how it stont wiþ me
Wherfor I þink out of þis lond to wende
Or elles of my self to make an ende
So ful am I of drede and eek of care
This monk bygan vpon þis wif to stare
And sayd allas my nece god forbede  
That ȝe for eny sorw or eny drede 
Fordo ȝour self but telleþ me ȝour greef
Parauenture I may in ȝoure mescheef
Councel or help and þerfor telleþ me
Al ȝour annoy for it schal be secre
For on my portos I make an oth
That neuer in my lif for lief ne loþ
Schal I of no counseil ȝou bywray
The same aȝein quod sche to ȝow I say
By god and by þis portos wil I swere
Though men me wolde al in peces tere
  
Ne schal I neuer for to go to helle 
Bywreye word  of þing þat ȝe me telle
Not for no cosynage ne alliaunce
But verrayly for loue and affiaunce
Thus ben þay sworn and hervpon Ikist
And ilk of hem told oþer what hem list
Cosyn quod sche if þat I had a space 
As I haue noon and namly in þis place
Then wold I telle a legend of my lyf
what I haue suffred siþ I was a wyf
wiþ myn housbond þough he be ȝour cosyn
Nay quod þis monk by god and seint martyn
He is no more cosyn vnto me
Than is þis leef þat hongeþ on þe tre
I clepid him so by seint Denis of Fraunce
To haue þe more cause of acqueyntaunce
Of ȝow which I haue loued specially
Abouen alle wommen sikerly
This swere I ȝow on my professioun
Tellith ȝoure greef lest þat he come a doun
And hasteth ȝow and goþ ȝour way anoon
My deere loue quod sche  O dan Iohn
Ful leef me were þis counseil to hyde
But out it moot it may no more abyde
Myn housbond is to me þe worste man
That euer was siþþe þe world bigan
But siþ I am a wif it sit nought me  
To telle eny wight of oure priuete
    
God schilde I scholde telle it for his grace 
A wyf ne schal not say of hir housbonde
But al honour as I can vnderstonde
Saue vnto ȝow þus moche telle I schal
As help me god he is not worþ at al
In no degre þe valieu of a flie
But ȝit me greueth most his nigardye
  
And wel ȝe wot þat wymmen naturelly
Desiren sixe þinges as wel as I
They wolde þat here housbondes scholde be
hardy and wys and riche and fre 
And buxom to his wyf and freisch on bedde
But by þe lord þat for vs alle bledde
For his honour my seluen to array
A sonday next comyng ȝit most I pay
An hundred frank or elles I am lorn
Ȝit were me leuer þat I were vnborn
Than me were doon a sclaunder or vilenye ·
And if myn housbond eek might it espie
I ner but lost and þerfor I ȝow pray
    
    
    
    
For a certein day I wol ȝow pay
And do to ȝow what pleasaunce and seruise
That I may do right as ȝou list deuyse
And but I do god take on me vengeaunce
As foul as hadde Geneloun of Fraunce
This gentil monk answard in þis manere
Now trewely myn owne lady deere 
I haue on ȝow so gret pite and reuthe 
That I ȝow swere and plighte ȝow my treuþe
That whan ȝour housbond is to Flaundres fare
I schal deliuer ȝow out of ȝoure care
For I wol bringe ȝow an hundred frankes 
And with þat word he caught hir by þe schankes
And hir embraced hard and kist hir ofte
Goth now ȝour way quod he al stille and softe 
And let vs dyne as sone as ȝe may
For by my chilindre it is prime of day  
Goth now and beth as trew as I schal be 
Now elles god forbede sire quod sche 
  
And forþ sche goth as ioly as a pye 
And bad þe cookes þat þai schold hem hye 
So þat men myghte dyne and þat anoon
vp to hir housbond þis wif is goon
And knokkeþ at  his dore boldely
Qy la quod he peter it am I
Quod sche how longe sire wol ȝe fast
how longe tyme wol ȝe reken and cast
ȝour sommes and ȝour bokes and ȝour þinges 
The deuel haue part of alle such rekenynges

Com doun to day and let ȝour bagges stonde
Ne be ȝe not aschamed that Daun Iohn
Schal al day fastyng þus elenge goon

The curious besynesse þat we haue
For of vs chapmen so god me saue
And by þat lord that cleped is seint Iue
Scarsly among twelue two schuln þriue
Continuelly lastyng in to her age
we may wel make cheer and good visage
And dryue forth þe world as it may be
And kepen our estat in priuete
Til we be deed or elles þat we play
A pilgrimage or goon out of þe way
And þerfor haue I  gret necessite
Vpon þis queynte world to auyse me
For euermor we moste stond in drede
Of hap and fortun  in our chapmanhede
To Flaundres to morw at day
And come agayn as soone as I may
For which my deere wif I þe byseeke
And be to euery wight buxom and meeke
And for to kepe oure good be curious
And honestly gouerne wel our hous    
Thou hast ynough in euery maner wise
That to a thrifty housbond may suffise
The lakkeþ noon array ne no vitaile
Of siluer in þy purs þou mayst not faile
And with þat word his contour dore he schitte
And doun he goþ no lenger wold he lette
And hastily a masse was þer sayd
And spedily þe tables were Ilayd
And to þe dyner faste þay hem spedde 
And rychely þis Chapman þe monk fedde 
And after dyner daun Iohn sobrely
This chapman took on part and priuely 
Sayd him þus cosyn it stondeth so
That wel I se to brigges wol ȝe go 
God and seint austyn spede ȝou and gyde 
I pray ȝow cosyn wisly þat ȝe ryde
Gouerneth ȝow also of ȝour diete
Al temperelly and namely in þis hete
Bitwix vs tuo nedeth no straunge fare
Far wel cosyn  god schilde ȝou fro care
If eny þing þer be by day or night
If it lay in my power and my might
That ȝe wil me comaunde in eny wise
It schal be doon right as ȝe wol deuyse 
O thing er þat ȝe goon if it might be 
I wolde pray ȝow for to lene me
An hundred frankes for a wyke or tweye
For certeyn bestis þat I moste beye 
To store with a place þat is oures
God help me so I wolde it were ȝoures
I schal not faile seurly of my day
Nought for a þousand frankes a myle way
But let þis þing be secre I ȝow pray 
For for þe bestis þis night most I pay
And fare now wel myn owne cosyn deere
Graunt mercy of ȝour cost and of ȝour cheere
  
This noble marchaunt gentilly anoon
Answerd and sayde O cosyn daun Iohn  
Now sikerly þis is a smal request
My gold is ȝoures whanne þat ȝow lest
And nought oonly gold but my chaffare 
Tak what ȝow liste  god schilde ȝe spare
But oon þing is ȝe know it wel ynough
Of chapmen þat her money is here plough
we may creaunce whils we haue a name
But goldles for to be it is no game
Pay it agayn whan it liþ in ȝour ese 
After my might ful fayn wold I ȝow plese 
This hundred frankes he fet forth anoon
And priuely he took hem to daun Iohn
No wight in al þis world wist of þis loone
Sauyng þe marchaund and dan Iohn alloone
Thay drynke and speke and rome a while and play
Til þat dan Iohn rydeþ to his abbay
The morwe cam and forth þe marchaund rideth
To Flaundresward his prentis wel him gydeth
Til þat he cam to Brigges merily
Now goth þis marchaund faste and busily
Aboute his neede and bieth and creaunceth
He neither pleyeth atte dys ne daunceþ
But as a marchaund schortly for to telle
he lad his lyf  and þer I let him duelle
The sonday next þe marchaund is agoon
To seint denys Icome is daun Iohn
with croune and berd al freisch and newe Ischaue
In al þe hous þer nas so litel a knaue
Ne no wight elles þat he nas ful fayn
For þat my lord dan Iohn was come agayn
And schortly to þe poynte for to gon
This faire wif acordith with dan Iohn
That for þese hundred frank he schuld al night
Haue hir in his armes bolt vpright
  
And þis acord parformed was in dede 
In mirth al night a bisy lif þay lede 
Til it was day þat dan Iohn went his way
And bad þe meigne far wel haue good day  
For noon of hem ne no wight in þe toun
Hath of dan Iohn right noon suspeccioun
And forth he rideth hom to his abbay
Or wher him list no more of him I say 
 This marchaund whan þat endid was þe faire
To seynt denys he gan to repeire 
And with his wif he makeþ fest and cheere
And tellith hir þat chaffar is so deere
That needes most he make a cheuisaunce
For he was bounde in a reconisaunce
To paye twenty þousand scheldes anoon
For which þis marchaund is to paris goon
To borwe of certeyn frendes þat he hadde 
A certein frankes and some with him he ladde 
And whan þat he was come in to þe toun
For gret chiertee and gret affeccioun
Vnto Dan Iohn he first goth him to play
Nought for to borwe of him no kyn monay
But for to wite and se of his wel fare
And for to telle him of his chaffare
As frendes doon whan þay ben met in fere
Dan Iohn him maketh fest and mery cheere
And he him told agayn ful specially
How he had bought right wel and graciously
Thanked be god  al his marchaundise
Saue þat he most in alle maner wise 
Maken a cheuyssauns as for his best
And þan he schulde be in ioye and rest
Dan Iohn answerde certis I am fayn
That ȝe in hele are comen hom agayn
And if þat I were riche as haue I blisse
Of twenty þousand scheld schuld ȝe not mysse
  
For ȝe so kyndely þis oþer day
lente me gold and as I can and may
I þanke ȝow by god and by seint Iame 
But naþeles I took it to oure dame
ȝoure wif þe same gold aȝein
vpon ȝour bench  sche wot it wel certeyn  
By certein toknes þat I can hir telle
Now by ȝour leue I may no lenger duelle
Oure abbot wol out of toun anoon
And in his compaignye moot I goon
Grete wel oure dame my nece swete
And far wel dere cosyn til þat we meete
This marchaund which þat was boþe war and wys 
Creaunced haþ and payed eek in parys
To certeyn lombardes redy in her hond
This somme of gold and took of hem his bond
And hom he goþ a mery as a popin iay
For wel he knew he stood in such array
That needes most he wynne in such viage
A þousand frankes aboue al his costage
His wyf redy mette him at þe gate
As sche was wont of old usage algate
And al þat night in mirþe þay ben sette
For he was riche and clerly out of dette
whan it was day þis marchaund gan embrace
his wyf al newe and kist hir on hir face
And vp he goth and maked it ful tough
No more quod sche by god ȝe haue ynough
And wantounly with him sche lay and playde
Till atte laste þus þis marchaund sayde
By god quod he I am a litel wroþ
with ȝow my wyf alþough it be me loth
And wite ȝe why by god as þat I gesse
ȝe han Imaad a maner straungenesse 
Bitwixe me and my cosyn dan Iohn
ȝe schold haue warned me er I had goon
  
That he ȝow had an hundred frankes payd
By redy tokne and huld him euel appayd
For þat I to him spak of cheuysaunce
Me semed so as by his countenaunce
But naþeles by god of heuen king
I þoughe nought to axe him no þing
I pray þe wif do no more so
Tel me alway er þat I fro þe go  
If eny dettour haue in myn absence
Ipayed þe lest in þy necgligence
I may him axe a þing þat he haþ payed
This wyf was not affered ne affrayed
But holly sche sayde and þat anoon
Mary I diffy þat false monk dan Iohn
I kepe not of his tokenes neuer a del
he took me a certeyn gold þat wot I wel
what euel thedom on his monkes snowte
For god it wot I wende wiþoute doute
That he had ȝeue it me by cause of ȝow
To do þer with myn honour and my prow
For cosynage and eek for bele cheer
That he haþ had ful ofte tyme heer
But synnes þat I stonde in þis disioynt
I wol answer ȝow schortly to þe poynt
Ȝe han mo slakke dettours þan am I
For I wol pay ȝow wel and redily
Fro day to day and if so be I faile
I am ȝour wif score it vpon my taile
And I schal paye it as soone as I may
For by my trouþe I haue on myn array
And nought on wast bistowed it euery del
And for I haue bistowed it so wel
To ȝoure honour for goddes sake I say
As beþ nought wroþ but let vs laugh and play 
Ȝe schul my ioly body haue to wedde
By god I wol not pay ȝow but on bedde 
  
Forȝeue it me myn owne spouse deere 
Turne hiderward and make better cheere
This marchaund saugh noon oþer remedy
And for to chide it nas but foly
Siþ þat þe þing may not amendid be 
wif he sayde  and I forȝiue it þe
But by þi lif ne be no more so large
keep better my good þis ȝiue I þe in charge
Thus endeþ now my tale and god vs sende
Talyng ynough vnto our lyues ende  Amen 
WEl sayd by corpus boones quod oure host  
Now longe mot þou sayle by þe cost
Sir gentil maister gentil mariner
God ȝiue þe monk a þousand last quadeȝer
haha felaws be war for such a iape
The monk put in þe mannes hood an ape
And in his wyues eek by seint austyn
Draweþ no monkes more vnto ȝour In
But now pasouer and let vs loke aboute
who schal telle first of al þis route 
Anoþer tale  and wiþ þat wiþ þat word he sayde 
As curteisly as it had ben a mayde 
My lady prioresse by ȝour leue
So þat I wist I scholde ȝow not greue
I wolde deme þat ȝe telle scholde
A tale next if so were þat ȝe wolde 
Now wol ȝe vouche sauf my lady deere 
Gladly quod sche  and sayd in þis manere
O Lord oure lord þy name how merueylous
Is in þis large world Isprad quod sche
For nought oonly þy laude precious

But by mouthes of children þy bounte
Parformed is on oure brest soukynge
Som tyme schewe þay þin heriynge
Wherfore in laude as I best can or may
Of þe and of þy white lily flour

To telle a story I wil do my labour
Nought þat I may encresce ȝoure honour
For sche hir silf  is honour and roote
Of bounte next hir sone and soules boote
O modir mayde O mayde mooder fre 
O bussh vnbrent brennyng in Moises sight
That rauysshedest  doun fro þe deite
Thurgh þin humblesse þe gost þat in þe alight
Of whos vertu he in þin herte pigh

For som tyme lady er men pray to þe 
Thow gost biforn of þy benignite
And getist vs þe light þurgh þy prayere 
To gyden vs þe way to þy sone sone so deere
  
My connyng is to weyk o blisful queene
For to declare þy grete worþinesse
That I may not þis in my wyt susteene
But as a child of twelf month old or lesse
Than can vnnethes eny word expresse
Right so fare I and þerfor I ȝou pray
Endith my song þat I schal of ȝow say
THer was in acy in a greet Citee
Amonges cristen folk a Iewerye
Susteyned by a lord of þat contre
For foul vsure and lucre of felonye 
Hateful to crist and to his compaignye 
And þurgh þe strete men might ride and wende 
For it was fre and open at euerich ende
A litel scole of cristen folk þer stood
Doun at þe forþer ende in which þer were
Children an heep ycomen of cristes blood
That lered in þat scole ȝer by ȝere
Such maner doctrine as men vsed þere
This is to say to synge and to rede
As smale childer doon in her childhede 
Among þese children was a widow sone
A litel clergeoun þat seue ȝer was of age
That day by day to scole was his wone
And eek also wherso he saugh þymage
Of cristes moder had he in vsage
As him was taught to knele a doun and say 
His Aue maria as he goþ by þe way    
Thus haþ þis widow hir litel child Itaught
Oure blisful lady cristes moder deere
To worschip ay and he forȝat it nought
For cely child wil alway soone leere
But ay whan I remembre of þis matiere
Seint Nicholas stont euer in my presence
For he so ȝong to crist dede reuerence
This litil child his litel book lernynge
As he sat in þe scole at his primere
He O alma redemptoris herde synge
As children lerned her antiphonere
And as he durst he drough hem ner and neere
And herkned euer þe wordes and þe note
Til he þe firste vers couþe al by rote
Nought wist he what þis latyn was to say 
For he so ȝong and tender was of age
But on a day his felaw gan he pray 
To expoune him þe song in his langage
Or telle him what þis song was in vsage 
This prayd he him to construe and declare
Ful often tyme vpon his knees bare 
His felaw which þat elder was þan he
Answerd him þus þis song I haue herd seye
was maked of our blisful lady fre
Hire to saluen and eek hire to preye
To ben our help and socour whan we deye
I can no more expoune in this matere
I lerne song I can no more gramer
And is þis song Imaad in reuerence
Of cristes moder sayde þis Innocent
Now certes I wol do my diligence
To conne it al er cristemasse be went
  
Though þat I for my primer schal be schent 
And schal be betyn þries in an hour
I wol it conne oure lady to honoure
His felaw taught him homward priuely
From day by day til he couþe it by rote
And þan he song it wel and boldely  
Twyes on þe day it passed þurgh his þrote
From word to word accordyng to þe note
To scoleward and homward whan he went
On cristes moder was set al his entent
As I haue sayd þurghout þe Iewrye
This litel child as he cam to and fro
Ful merily þan wold he synge and crie 
O alma Redemptoris euer mo
The swetnes haþ his herte persed so
Of cristes moder that to hir to pray
he can not stynt of syngyng by þe way 
Oure firste foo þe serpent Sathanas
That hath in Iewes hert his waspis nest
Vpswal and sayde  o ebreik peple allas
Is þis a þing to ȝow þat is honest
That such a boy schal walken as him lest
In ȝoure despyt and synge of such sentence
which is aȝens ȝour lawes reuerence
Fro þennes forth þe Iewes han conspired
This Innocent out of þis world to enchace
An homicide þer to han ȝe þay hired
That in an aley had a priue place
And as þe childe gan forþ by to pace
This false iewe him hent and huld ful faste 
And kut his þrote and þrewe him in atte laste
  
I say in a wardrobe þay him þrew
wher as the Iewes purgen her entraile
O cursed folk O herodes al newe
what may ȝour euyl entente ȝou auaile
Morther wol out certeyn it wil nought faile
And namly þer þonour of god schuld sprede
The blood out crieþ on ȝour cursed dede 
O martir soudit to Virginite
Now maystow synge folowyng euer in oon
The white lomb celestial quod sche 
Of which þe grete euaungelist seint Iohn
In pathmos wroot which seith þat þay goon
Bifore þe lamb and synge a song al newe  
That neuer fleischly wommen þay knewe
This pore widowe wayteþ al þis night
After þis litel child but he cometh nought
For which as soone as it was dayes light
with face pale in drede and busy þought
Sche haþ at scole and elleswher him sought
Til fynally sche gan of hem aspye
That he was last seyn in þe Iewerie
With moodres pite in hir brest enclosed
Sche goþ as sche were half out of hir mynde
To euery place wher sche haþ supposed
By liklihede hir child for to fynde
And euer on cristes mooder meke and kynde
Sche cried and atte laste þus sche wrought
Among þe cursed Iewes sche him sought
Sche freyned and sche prayed pitously
To euery Iew þat dwelled in þat place
To telle hir if hir child wente þer by
Thay sayden nay but Ihū of his grace
  
Ȝaf in hir þought wiþinne a litel space
That in þat place after hir sone sche cryde
wher as he was cast in a put besyde 
O grete god þat parformedist þin laude
by mouth of Innocentȝ lo here þy might
This gemme of chastite þis emeraude
And eek of martirdom þe ruby bright
Ther he with þrote Ikut lay vpright
He  Alma redemptoris gan to synge
So lowde þat al þe place bigan to rynge
The cristen folk þat þurgh þe strete went
In comen for to wonder vpon þis þing
And hastily for the prouost þay sent
He cam anoon wiþoute tarying
And heriede crist þat is of heuen kyng
And eek his moder honour of mankynde
And after þat þe Iewes let he bynde
This child with pitous lamentacioun
vp taken was syngyng his song alway  
And with honour of gret processioun
Thay caried him vnto þe next abbay
His modir swownyng by þe beere lay
Vnneþe might þe poeple þat was þere
This newe Rachel bringe fro þe beere
With torment and with schamful deth echon
This prouost doþ þese Iewes for to sterue
That of þis moerder wist and þat anoon
he wolde no such cursednesse obserue
Euel schal haue þat euyl wol deserue
Therfore with wilde hors he dede hem drawe
And after þat he heng hem by þe lawe
  
Vpon his beere ay lith þis Innocent
Biforn þe chief auter whiles þe masse last
And after þat þabbot with his couent
Haþ sped him for to burie him ful fast
And whan þay halywater on him cast
Ȝet spak þis child whan spreynde was þe water
And song O alma redemptoris mater
This abbot which þat was an holy man
As monkes ben or elles oughte be
This ȝonge child to coniure he bigan
And sayd O deere child I halse þe
In vertu of þe holy trinite
Tel me what is þy cause for to synge
Sith þat þy throte is kit at my semynge
My þrote is kit vnto my nekke boon
Sayde þis child and as by way of kynde
I schulde han ben deed long tyme a goon
But Ihū crist as ȝe in bookes fynde
wol þat his glorie laste and be in mynde
And for þe worschip of his moder deere
Ȝet may I synge O alma lowde and cleere
This welle of mercy cristes moder swete
I loued alway as after my connynge
And whan þat I my lyf schulde leete
To me sche cam and bad me for to synge
This antym verraily in my deyinge  
As ȝe haue herd and whan þat I had songe
Me þought sche layde a grayn vnder my tonge
Wherfor I synge and synge moot certeyne
In honour of þat blisful mayden fre
Til fro my tonge taken is þe greyne
And after þat þus saide sche to me
  
My litil child now wil I fecche þe
whan þat þe grayn is fro þi tonge Itake
Be nought agast I wol þe nought forsake
This holy monk this abbot him mene I
His tonge out caught and took awey þe greyn
And he ȝaf vp þe gost ful softely
And whan þe abbot hath þis wonder seyn
His salte teres striken doun as reyn
And gruf he fel a doun vnto þe grounde
And stille he lay as he had ben ybounde
The couent eek lay on þe pauyment
wepyng and herying cristes moder deere
And after þat þay rise and forþ þay went
And took away þis martir fro his beere 
In a tombe of marble stoones cleere
Enclosed þay þis litil body sweete
Ther he is now god leue vs for to meete
O ȝonge hughe of lyncoln slayn also
wiþ cursed iewes as it is notable 
For it nys but a litel while ago
Pray eek for vs we synful folk vnstable
That of his mercy god so merciable
On vs his grete mercy multiplie
For reuerence of his modir marie Amen
Whan sayd was þis miracle euery man
As sober was þat wonder was to se
Til þat oure host to iape bigan
And þan at erst he loked vpon me
And sayde þus what man art þou quod he
Thou lokest as þou woldest fynde an hare
For euer vpon þe ground I se þe stare 
Approche ner and loke merily  
Now ware ȝou sires and let þis man haue space
He in þe wast is schape as wel as I
This were a popet in an arm to embrace
For any womman smal and fair of face 
He semeth eluisch by his countenaunce
For vnto no wight doth he daliaunce
Say now som what sins other folk han said
Telle vs a tale and þat of mirthe anoon
host quod I ne beþ nought euel apayd
For other tale certes can I noon
But of a rym I lerned ȝore agoon
Ȝe þat is good quod he now schul we heere
Som deynte þing me þinketh by his cheere
LEsteneþ lordyngs  in good entent
And I wol telle verrayment
Of myrthe and solas
Of a knyght was fair and gent
In batail and in tornament
His name was sir Thopas
Ibore he was in fer conntre
In Flaundres al byȝonde þe se
At Poperyng in þe place
His fader was a man ful fre
And lord he was of þat contre
As it was goddes grace
Sir Thopas wax a doughty swayn
whyt was his face as payndemayn
His lippes reed as Rose 
His rode is lik  scarlet en grayn
And I ȝow telle in good certayn
He had a semly nose
His heer his berd was lik safroun
That to his girdil raught a doun
His schoon of Cordewane
Of Brigges were his hosen broun
His robe was of Sicladoun
That coste many a Iane    
He couþe hunt at wilde deer
And ride on haukyng for ryuer
with gray goshauk on honde
Therto he was a good archeer
Of wrastelyng was noon his peer
Ther eny Ram schal stonde 
Ful many mayde bright in bour
Þay mourne for him paramour
whan hem were bet to slepe
But he was chast and no lecchour
And sweet as is þe brembre flour
That bereþ þe reede heepe 
And so it fel vpon a day
For soþ as I ȝow telle may 
Sir Thopas wold out ryde
he worth vpon his steede gray
And in his hond a launcegay
A long sword by his syde
he priketh þurgh a fair forest
Ther In is many a wilde best
Ȝe boþe buk  and hare
And as he prikeþ north and Est
I tel it ȝow hym had almest
Bityd a sory care
Ther springen herbes greet and smale
The licorys and þe Cetewale 
And many a clow gilofre
And notemuge to put in ale
wheþir it be moist or stale
Or for to lay in cofre
  
The briddes synge it is no nay
The sperhauk and þe popiniay
That ioye it was to heere
The þrostilcok maad eek his lay
The woode dowue vpon þe spray
So song ful lowde and cleere
Sir Thopas fel in louelonging
whan that he herde þe briddes synge  
And priked as he were wood
His faire steede in his prikynge
So swette þat men might him wrynge
His sydes were al blood
Sir Thopas eek so wery was
For priking on þe softe gras
So feers was his corrage
That doun he layd him in þe place
To make his steede som solace
And ȝaf him good forage
O seinte Mary benedicite
what eylith þis loue at me
To bynde me so sore
My dremed al this night par de
An elf queen schal my lemman be
And slepe vnder my gore
An Elf queen wol I haue Iwis
For in this world no womman is
worthy to be my make In toune
Alle oþir wommen I forsake
And to an Elf queen I me take
By dale and eek by doune
  
In to his sadil he clomb anoon
And priked ouer stile and stoon
An elf queen for to spye
Til he so longe haþ ryden and goon
That he fond in a priue woon
The contre of fairye
 So wylde
For in þat contre was þer noon
    
Neither wif ne childe
Til þat þer cam a greet geaunt
his name was sir Olifaunt
A perilous man of dede
he swar child by Termagaunt
For if þou prike out of myn haunt
Anoon I slee þe
with my mace
heer is þe queen of fayerie
with harp and lute and Symphonye
dwellyng in þis place
The child sayd also mote I the  
To morwe wil I meete with þe

And ȝit I hope par ma fay
That þou schalt with þis launcegay
Abyen it ful soure
 þy mawe
Schal I persyn if þat I may
Er it be fully prime of day
For heer schalt þou be slawe
  
Sir thopas drough on bak ful fast
This geaunt at him stoones cast 
Out of a fell staf slynge
But faire eschapeþ child thopas
And al it was þurgh goddis gras
And þurgh his berynge 
Ȝet lesteneth lordynges to my tale 
Merier þan þe nightyngale 
I wol ȝow roune
how sir thopas wiþ sides smale 
Prikynge ouer hul and dale
Is come ageyn to toune
his mery men comaunded he
To make him boþe game and gle
For needes most he fight
with a geaunt with heedes þre
For paramours and iolite
Of oon þat schon ful bright
Do come he sayde my mynstrales
And gestours for to telle tales
Anoon in myn armynge
Of Romaunces þat ben reales
Of popes and of Cardinales
And eek of loue likynge
Thay fet him first þe swete wyn
And made him eek in a maselyn
A real spicerye
Of gyngebred þat was so fyn
And licorys and eek comyn
with sugre þat is trye     
He dede next his white leere
Of cloth of lake whyt and cleere
A brech and eek a schert
And next his schert an aketoun
And ouer þat an haberioun
For persyng of his hert
And ouer þat a fyn hauberk
was al Iwrought of Iewes werk
Ful strong it was of plate
And ouer þat his cotearmour
As whyt as is a lily flour
In which he wold debate
his scheld was al of gold so red
And þer Inne was a bores heed
A charbocle by his syde 
And ther he swor on ale and bred
How þat þe geaunt schal be deed
Bytyde what bytyde 
His iambeux were of quirboily
His swerdes schethe of yuory
His helm of latoun bright
His sadel was of rowel boon
His bridel as þe sonne schon
Or as þe moone light
his spere was of Cipres
That bodeth werre and no þing pees
The heed ful scharp Igrounde 
His steede was al dappul gray
Hit goth an ambel in þe way 
Ful softely and rounde
  
 In londe
lo lordes heer is a fyt
If ȝe wil eny more of it
To telle it wol I fonde
NOw hold ȝour mouth for charite
Boþe knight and lady fre
And herkneþ to my spelle
Of batail and of chiualry
And of ladys loue drewery  
Anoon I wol ȝow telle 
Men speken of Romauns of pris
Of horn child and of ypotis
Of Beuys and sir Gy
Of sir libeaux and pleyn damour
But sir thopas bereþ þe flour
Of real Chiualry
His goode steede he bistrood
And forth vpon his way he glood
As spark out of þe bronde
Vpon his crest he bar a tour
And þer In stiked a lily flour
God schilde his corps fro schonde
And for he was a knyȝt auntrous
He nolde slepen in noon hous
But liggen in his hood
his brighte helm was his wonger
And by him baytith his destrer
Of herbes fyne and goode
  
Himself drank water of þe welle
As dede þe knight of pertinelle 
So worthy vnder wede
    
NO mor of þis for goddes dignite
Quod our hoste  for þou makest me
So wery of þy verrey lewednesse
That al so wisly god my soule blesse 
Myn eeres aken for þy drasty speche
Now such a rym þe deuel I byteche
This may wel be rym dogerel quoþ he
why so quod I why wilt þou lette me
More of my tale þan anoþer man
Syn þat it is þe beste rym þat I can
By god quod he for pleinly at o word
Þy drasty rymyng is not worth a tord
Þou dost nought elles but despendist tyme
Sir at o word þou schalt no lenger ryme
let se wher þou canst tellen ought in gest
Or telle in prose som what atte lest  
In which þer be so merthe or doctrine
Gladly quod I by goddes swete pyne 
I wol ȝow telle a litel þing in prose
That oughte like ȝow as I suppose 
Or elles certes ȝe be to daungerous
It is a moral tale vertuous
Al be it told som tyme in sondry wise
Of sondry folk as I schal ȝow deuyse 
As thus ȝe woot þat euery euaungelist
Þat telleþ vs þe peyne of Ihū crist
Ne saith alle þing as his felawes doþ
But naþeles here sentence is al soþ
And alle accorden as in here sentence
Al be þer in her tellyng difference 
  
For some of hem sayn more and some lesse 
whan þay his pitous passioun expresse 
I mene of mark mathew luk and Iohn
But douteles her sentence is al oon
Therfor lordynges alle I ȝow biseche
If ȝow þink þat I varye as in my speche
As þus þough þat I telle som what more
Of prouerbes þan I haue herd bifore
Comprehended in þis litel tretys here 
To enforcen with þeffect of my matiere
And þough I not þe same wordes say
As ȝe haue herd  ȝit to ȝow alle I pray
Blameþ me nought for in my sentence
Schul ȝe no wher fynde difference
Fro þe sentence of þis tretys lite
After þe which þis litil tale I wryte
And þerfor herkeneþ what I schal say
And let me tellen al my tale I pray
Whan ended was my tale of Melibe
And of prudence and hire benignite
Oure hoste sayde as I am faithful man
And by þe precious corpus Madryan
I hadde leuer þan a barel ale
That godeleef my wyf had herd þis tale
For sche is no þing of such pacience
As was þis melibeus wyf dame prudence
By goddes boones whan I bete my knaues
Sche bringeth me forth þe grete clobbet staues
And crieþ slee þe dogges euerychon
And breke of hem boþe bak and bon
And if þat eny neghebour of myne
wol nought to my wyf in chirche enclyne
Or be so hardy to hir to trespace
whan sche comþ hom sche rampeth in my face
And crieþ false coward wreke þy wyf
By Corpes bones I wil haue þy knyf
And þou schalt haue my distaf and go spynne
Fro day to night þus sche wil bygynne 
Allas sche saith þat euer I was Ischape
To wedde a mylksop or a coward ape
That wil be ouerlad wiþ euery wight
þou darst nought stonde by þy wyues right
This is my lif but if þat I wil fight
And out atte dore anoon I most me dight 
And ellis I am lost  but if þat I
Be lik a wilde leoun foolhardy
I wot wel sche wol do me sle som day
Som neighebor and þanne renne away
For I am perilous with knyf in honde
Al be it þat I dar not hir wiþstonde
  
For sche is big in armes by my faith
That schal he fynde þat hire mys doth or saith  
But let vs passe a way fro þis matiere
My lord þe monk quod he be mery of chere 
For ȝe schul telle a tale trewely
Lo Rowchestre stant heer faste by
Ryde forþ myn oughne lord brek nouȝt oure game
But by my trouþe I can not ȝoure name
whether schal I calle ȝow my lord dan Iohn
Or daūn Thomas or elles dan albon
Of what hous be ȝe by ȝour fader kyn
I vow to god þou hast a ful fair skyn
It is a gentil pasture þer þou gost
Thow art not lik a penaunt or a goost
vpon my faith þou art an officer
Som worþy sexteyn or som Celerer
For by my fader soule as to my doome
Thou art an officer whan þou art at hoom
No pouer cloysterer ne non nouys
But a gouernour wily and wys
And þer wiþ al of brawne and of bones
A wel faryng persone for þe noones
I praye god ȝiue him confusioun
Þat first þe brouȝte to religioun
Thow woldist han be a tredefoul aright
haddist þou as gret a leue as might
To parforme al þi wil in engendrure
Thow haddist bigeten many a creature
Allas why werest þou so wyd a cope
God ȝif me sorwe and I were a pope
Nought only þou but euery mighty man
Though he were schore brode vpon his pan
Schuld han a wif for al þis world is lorn
Religioun hath take vp al þe corn
Of tredyng and we burel men ben schrympes
Of feble trees þer comeþ feble ympes
  
This makiþ þat oure heires ben so sclender
And feble þat þay may not wel engender
This makeþ þat our wyfes wol assaye
Religious folk for þay may bettre paye  
Of venus payementes þan may we
God woot no lusscheburghes paye ȝe 
beþ nouȝt wroþ my lorde þough I play
For oft in game a soth I haue herd say
This worþy monk took al in pacience 
And saide I wol doon al my diligence
Als fer as souneþ in to honeste 
To telle ȝow a tale or tuo or þre
And if ȝow lust to herken hiderward
I wil ȝow say þe lif of seint Edward
Or elles first tredis wil I ȝow telle 
Of which I haue an hundred in my celle 
Tregedis is to sayn a certeyn storie
As olde bookes maken vs memorie
Of hem þat stood in greet prosperite
And is fallen out of heigh degre
In to miserie and endith wrecchedly
And þay ben versifyed comunly
Of six feet which men clepe exametron
In prose ben eek endited many oon
And in metre eek and in sondry wise
Lo þis declaryng ought ynough suffise 
Now herkneþ if ȝow likith for to heere
But first I ȝow biseche in þis matiere 
þough I by ordre telle not þise þinges
Be it of popes emperours or kynges
After her age as men may write fynde
But telle hem som bifore and som byhynde 
As it comeþ now  to my remembraunce
haueþ me excused of myn ignoraunce
Iwol bywaile in maner of tregedye
The harm of hem þat stood in heigh degre
And fallen so þe is no remedye
To bring hem out of her aduersite
For certeynly whan fortune lust to flee
Ther may no man þe cours of hir whiel holde
let no man truste in blynd prosperite  
Beþ war by þese ensamples trewe and olde 
AT lucifer þough he an aungil were
And no man at him wil I bygynne
For þough fortune may non aungel dere
From heigh degre ȝit fel he for his synne
Doun in to helle wher he ȝet is Inne
O lucifer brightest of aungels alle
Now art þou Sathanas þat maist nouȝt twynne
Out of miserie in which þou art falle
Lo adam in þe feld of Damassene
wiþ goddes oughne fynger wrought was he 
And nought bigeten of mannes sperma vnclene
And welt al paradys sauyng oon tre
had neuer worldly man suche degre
As adam til he for mys gouernance
was dryuen out of heigh prosperite
To labour and to helle and to meschaunce

Lo Sampson  þat was annunciate
By þangel long er his natiuite 
And was to god almighty consecrate
And stood in nobles whil þat he might se
was neuer such anoþer as was he
To speke of strengþ  and þerto hardynesse
But to his wyfes tolde he his secre
Thurgh which he slough himself for wrecchidnesse 
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Thre hundred foxis  tok Sampson for Ire
And alle her tayles he togider bond
And sette þe foxes tailes alle on fuyre
For he in euery tail hath knyt a brond
And þay brent alle þe cornes of þat lond
And alle her Olyuers  and vynes eeke
A þousand men he slough eek wiþ his hond
And hadde no wepen but an asses cheeke
Whan þay were slayn so þursted him þat he
was wel ner lorn for which he gan to preye
That god wolde of his peyne haue som pite
And send him drynk and elles most he deye
And out of his asses cheke þat was so dreye  
Out of a woung toþ sprong anon a welle
Of which he dronk ynough schortly to seye
Thus halp him god as Iudicum can telle
  
By verray fors of algason on a night
Maugre þe philistiens of þat cite
The gates of þe toun he haþ vp plight
And on his bak caried hem haþ he 
heigh vpon an hil wher men might hem se 
O noble almighty Sampson leef and deere
haddest þou nought to wommen told þy secre
In al þe world ne hadde be þy peere
This sampson neyther siser dronk ne wyn 
Ne on his heed com rasour noon ne schere
By precept of þe messager diuyn
For alle his strengþes in his heres were
And fully twenty wynter ȝer by ȝere
he hadde of Ierusalem þe gouernaunce
But soone he schal wepe many a teere
For wymmen schuln him bringe to meschaunce
Vnto his lemman Dalida he tolde
That in his heres al his strengþe lay
And falsly to his foomen sche him solde
And slepyng in hir barm vpon a day
Sche made to clippe or schere his heres away
And made his foomen al his craft espien
And whan þay fond him in þis array
Thay bound him fast and put out boþe his yen
But er his heer clipped was or Ischaue
Ther was no bond wiþ which men might him bynde
But now is he in prisoun in a caue
Ther as þay made him at þe querne grynde
O noble Sampson strengest of al man kynde
O whilom iugge in glory and in richesse 
Now maystow wepe wiþ þine eyȝen blynde
Sith þou fro wele art falle to wrecchednesse
  
Thend of þis caytif was as I schal say
his foomen made a fest vpon a day
And made him as here fool biforn hem play  
And þis was in a temple of gret array
But atte last he made a foul affray
For he two pilers schook and made hem falle
And doun fel temple and al and þer it lay
And slough himsilf and eek his fomen alle
This is to sayn þe princes euer ichon
And eek þre þousand bodies were þer slayn
with fallyng of þe grete temple of stoon
Of Sampson wil I no more sayn
Be war by þese ensamples olde and playn
That no man telle his counseil to his wyf
Of such þing as he wold haue secre fayn
If þat it touche his lymes or his lif
Of Ercules þe souereyn conquerour
Singing his werkes laude and heigh renoun
For in his tyme of strength he bar þe flour
he slough and rafte þe skyn fro þe leoun
he of Centaures layde þe bost a doun
he arpies slough þe cruel briddes felle
The gold appul he raft fro þe dragoun
he drof out cerbures þe fend of helle
He slough þe cruel tyrant bupherus
And made his hors to frete him fleisch and boon
he slough þe verray serpent venencus
Of Adiloyus tuo hornes he raft oon
he slough Catus in a caue of stoon
he slough þe geaunt adeus þe stronge
he slough þe grisly leoun and þat anoon
And bar þe heed vpon his necke longe
  
Was neuer wight  siþþen þe world bigan
That slough so many monstres as dede he
Thurghout þe wide world his name ran
what for his strengþe and for his bounte
And euery roialme went he for to se
he was so strong þer might no man him lette
At boþe þe worldes endes as saith trophe
In stede of boundes he a piler sette
A lemman hadde þis noble campioun  
That highte Deianire freissh as may
And as þese clerkes maken mencioun
Sche haþ him sent a schurte fresch and gay
Alas þis schirt allas and wailaway
Enuenymed was soþly with alle
That er he hadde wered it half a day
It made his fleisch al fro his bones falle 
But natheles som clerkes hir excusen
By oon þat highte Nessus þat it makyd
Be as be may I wil nouȝt hir accusyn
But on his bak he wered þis schirt al naked
Til þat his fleisch was for þe venym blaked
And whan he saugh noon oþer remedye
In hote colis he haþ himself Iraked
For no venym deyned him to dye
Thus starf þis mighty and worthy Ercules
lo who may truste fortune eny þrowe
For him þat folweþ al þis world of pres
Er he be war is oft ylayd ful lowe 
Ful wys is he þat can himseluen knowe 
Be war for whan þat fortune lust to glose 
Than waytith sche hir man to ouerþrowe 
By suche way as he wolde lest suppose

The mighty trone þe precious tresor
The glorious ceptre and real mageste
That had þe king Nabugodonosore
wiþ tonge vnnethes may descryued be
he twyes wan ierusalem þat Cite
The vessel out of þe temple he wiþ him ladde 
At Babiloyne was his souereyn see
In which his glorie and his delyt he ladde 
The fairest children of þe blood roial
Of Israel he dede gelde anoon
And made ylk of hem to ben his þral
Amonges oþre Daniel was oon
That was þe wisest child of euerychoon
For he þe dremes of þe king expouned
Ther as in Caldeyn was þer clerkes noon  
That wiste to what fyn his dremes souned
This proude king let make a statu of gold
Sixty cubites long and seuen in brede
To which ymage boþe ȝonge and olde 
Comaunded he to loue and haue in drede
Or in a fornays ful of flames rede
he schulde be brent þat wolde not obeye 
But neuer wolde assente to þat dede
Danyel ne his felawes tweye
This king of kinges preu was elate
he wende god þat sit in mageste
Ne might him nought  bireue of his estate
But sodeynly he left his dignite
Ilik a best him semed for to be
And eet hay as an oxe and lay þeroute 
In rayn with wilde bestes walkyd he

  
And lik an Eglis fetheres were his heres
his hondes like a briddes clowes were
Til god relessed him a certeyn ȝeres
And ȝaf him witte and þanne with many a tere
he þanked god and euer he is afere
To doon amys or more to trespace
And er þat tyme he layd was on bere
he knew wel god was ful of might and grace
His sone which þat highte Balthaȝar
That huld þe regne after his fader day
he by his fader couþe nought be war
For proud he was of hert and of array
And eek an ydolaster was he ay
his heigh astate assured him in pryde
But fortune cast him doun and þer he lay
And sodeynly his regne gan diuide
A fest he made vnto his lordes alle
vpon a tyme he made hem bliþe be
And þan his officeres gan he calle
Goþ bringeth forth þe vessealx quod he
The which my fader in his prosperite
Out of þe temple of ierusalem byraft  
And to oure hihe goddis þanke we
Of honours þat oure eldres with vs laft
His wif his lordes and his concubines
Ay dronken whiles her arriont last
Out of þis noble vesseals sondry wynes
And on a wal þis king his yhen cast 
And saugh an hond armles þat wroot fast 
For fere of which he quook and siked sore
þis hond þat balthaȝar so sore agast
wrot mane techel phares and no more 
  
In al þe lond magicien was noon
That couþe expounde what þis lettre ment
But Daniel expoundiþ it anoon
And sayde king god þy fader sent
Glori and honour regne tresor and rent
And he was proud and no þing god ne dredde
And þerfor god gret wreche vpon him sent
And him biraft þe regne þat he hadde 
He was out cast of mannes compaignye
with asses was his habitacioun
And eete hay in wet and eek in drye
Til þat he knew by grace and by resoun
That god of heuen had dominacioun
Ouer euery regne and euery creature
And þan had god of him compassioun
And him restored to his regne and his figure
Eke þou þat art his sone art proud also
And knowest al þis þing so verrayly
And art rebel to god and art his fo
þou dronk eek of his vessel bodily
Thy wyf eek and þy wenche sinfully
Dronke of þe same vessel sondry wynes
And heriest false goddes cursedly
Therfore to þe schapen ful gret pyne es
This hond was send fro god þat on þe wal
wrot mane techel phares truste me
Thy regne is doon þou weist nouȝt at al
Diuidid is þy regne and it schal be  
To meedes and to perses ȝeuen quod he
And þilke same night þe king was slawe
And Darius occupied his degre
þough þerto neyþer had he right ne lawe 
  
Lordyngs ensample herby may ȝe take
how þat in lordschip is no sikernesse
For whan fortune wil a man forsake
Sche bereþ away his regne and his richesse 
And eek his frendes boþe more and lesse 
And what man hath of frendes þe fortune
Mishap wil make hem enemyes I gesse

Cenobia of palmire þe queene
As writen parciens of hir noblesse
So worþy was in armes and so keene
That no wight passed hir in hardynesse
Ne in lynage ne in oþer gentilesse 
Of þe kinges blood  of pers sche is descendid
I say þat sche had not most fairnesse
But of hir schap sche might not ben amendid
Fro hir childhod  I fynde þat sche fledde
Office of wommen and to woode sche went
And many a wilde hertes blood sche schedde
with arwes brode þat sche to hem sent 
Sche was so swyft þat sche anoon hem hent
And whan þat sche was elder sche wolde kille
Leouns  lebardes  and beres altorent
And in hir armes weld hem at hir wille
Sche dorste wilde bestes dennes seke
And renne in þe mounteyns al þe night
And slepe vnder a bussh and sche couþe eeke
wrastil by verray fors and verray might
wiþ eny ȝong man were he neuer so wight
Ther mighte no þing in hir armes stonde
She kept hir maydenhed from euery wight
To no man deyned hire to be bonde
  
But atte last hir frendes han hir maried
To Odenake a prince of þat Citee
Al were it so þat sche him longe taried  
And ȝe schul vnderstonde how þat he
had suche fantasies as hadde sche 
But naþeles whan þay were knyt in fere
Thay lyued in ioye and in felicite
For ech of hem had oþer leef and deere
Saue oon þing sche wolde neuer assent
By no way þat he schulde by hir lye
But oones for it was hir playn entent
To haue a child þe world to multiplie
And also soone as she might aspye 
That sche was not wiþ childe ȝit in dede 
Than wold sche suffre him doon his fantasie
Eft sones and nought but oones out of drede 
And if sche were wiþ child at þilke cast
No more schuld he playe þilke game
Til fully fourty dayes were ypast
Than wold sche suffre him to do þe same
Al were þis Odenake wilde or tame
he gat no more of hir for þus sche sayde
hit nas but wyues lecchery and schame 
In oþer caas if þat men with hem playde 
Tuo sones by þis Odenak had sche
The which sche kept in vertu and lettrure
But now vnto our purpos torne we
I say so worschipful a creature
And wys worþy and large with mesure
So penyble in þe werre and curteys eeke
Ne more labour might in werre endure 
was no wher noon in al þis world to seeke
  
Hir riche array if it might be told
As wel in vessel as in hir cloþing
Sche was al cloþed in perre and gold
And eek sche lafte nought for hir huntyng
To haue of sondry tonges ful knowing
whan sche had leyser  and might þerto entent
To lerne bookes was al hir likyng
How sche in vertu might hir lif despent
And schortly of þis story for to trete  
So doughty was hir housbond and eek sche
That þay conquered many regnes grete
In thorient with many a fair citee
Appurtienant vnto that mageste 
Of Rome and with strong hond hulden hem fast
Ne neuer might her fomen doon hem fle
Ay while Odenakes dayes last
Her batails who  so lust hem for to rede
Agayn Sapor þe king and oþer mo
And how þat þis processe fel in dede
why sche conquered and what title had þerto
And after of hir meschief and hir woo 
how þat sche was deceyued and Itake 
let hem vnto my mayster perark go
That writeth of þis ynough I vndertake 
Whan Odenake was deed sche mightily
The regnes huld and wiþ hir propre hond
Aȝeins hir foos sche faught ful trewely
That þer nas king ne prince in þat lond
That he nas glad if he þat grace fond
That sche ne wold vpon his lond werraye
with hir þay made alliaunce by bond
To ben in pees and let hir ryde and play
  
The emperour of Rome Claudius
Ne him biforn þe romayn· Galiene
Ne dorste neuer be so corrageous
Ne noon ermine ne Egipciene
No Surrien ne noon arrabiene
wiþinne þe feld þat durste with hir fight
Lest þat sche wold hem wiþ her hondes sleen
Or wiþ hir meyne putten hem to flight
In kinges abyt went hir sones tuo
As heires of her fadres regnes alle
And hermanno and Themaleo
here names were and Parciens men hem calle 
But ay fortune hath in hir hony galle
This mighty queene may no while endure
Fortune out of hir regne made hir falle  
To wrecchednesse and to mys aduenture
Aurilian whan þat þe gouernaunce
Of Rome cam into his hondes tway 
he schop him of þis queen to do vengeaunce 
And with his legiouns he took þe way
Toward Cenoby and schortly to say
he made hir flee and atte last hir hent
And feterid hir and eek hir children tweye
And wan þe lond and home to Rome he went
Amonges oþer þinges þat he wan
hir chaar þat was wiþ gold wrouȝt and perre
This grete Romayn þis aurilian
hath with him lad for þat men schulde se
Bifore þis triumphe walkith sche 
And gilte cheynes in hir necke hongynge
Coroun sche was as aftir hir degre

  
Allas fortune sche that whilom was
Dredful to kinges and to Emperoures
Now gaulith al þe pepul on hir alas
And sche þat helmyd was in starke stoures 
And wan bifore tounes stronge and toures
Schal on heed now were a wyntermyte
And sche þat bar þe cepter ful of floures
Schal bere a distaf hir self for to quyte
O noble petro þe glori of Spayne 
whom fortune held so heigh in mageste
wel oughte men þy pitous deþ complayne
Thy bastard broþer made þe to fle
And after  at a sege by subtilte
þow were bytrayed and lad to his tent
wher  as he with his oughne hond slough þe
Succedyng in þy lond and in þy rent
The feld of snow with thegle of blak þerInne
Caught wiþ þe leoun reed coloured as is þe gleede
he brewede þe cursednesse and synne
The wikked nest werker of þis neede
Nought Oliuer ne Charles þat ay took heede
Of trouthe and honour but of armoryk  
Geniloun oliuer corruptid for nede
Broughte þis worþy king in such a bryk
O worþy petro king of Cipres also
That alisaunder wan by heigh maistrye 
Ful many an hethen wroughtest þou ful wo
Of which þin oughne lieges had enuye
And for no þing but for þy chiualrie
þay in thy bed han slayn þe by þe morwe
Thus can fortune þe whel gouerne and gye
And out of ioye bringe men in to sorwe  
Of Melayn grete Barnabo viscount
God of delyt and strength of lumbardye
why schuld þyn infortune I nought accounte
Syn in astaat þou clombe were so hye
Thy broþer sone þat was þy double allie
For he þy neuew was and sone in lawe
wiþinne his prisoun made þe to dye
But why ne how not I þat þou were slawe 
Of erl hugilin of pise þe langour
Ther may no tonge telle þe pite
But litel out of pise stant a tour
In whiche tour  in prisoun put was he 
And with him been his litil children þre
Theldest skarsly fyf ȝer was of age 
Allas fortune it was gret cruelte
Suche briddes to put in such a cage
Dampnyd he was to deye in þat prisoun
For Roger which þat bisschop was of pise
Had on him maad a fals suggestioun
Thurgh which þe peple gan on him arise
And putte him in prisoun in such wise
As ȝe han herd and mete and drynk he hadde
So smal þat wel vnneþe it may suffise
And þer wiþ al it was ful pore and badde
And on a day bifel þat in þat hour
whan þat his mete was wont to be brought
The gayler schet þe dores of þat tour
He herd it wel but he saugh it nought  
And in his hert anoon þer fel a þought
þat þay for hungir wolde doon him dyen
Alas quod he allas þat I was wrought
Therwiþ þe teeres felle fro his eyen
  
His ȝongest sone þat þre ȝer was of age
Vnto him sayde fader why do ye wepe
whan wil þe gayler bringen oure potage
Is þer no morsel bred þat ȝe doon kepe
I am so hongry þat I may not sleepe
Now wolde god þat I might slepe euer
Than schuld not hunger in my wombe crepe
Ther is no þing saue bred þat me were leuer
Thus day by day þis child bigan to crie
Til in his fadres barm adoun he lay
And sayde far wel fader I moot dye
And kist his fader and dyde þe same day
And whan þe woful fader deed it say
For wo his armes tuo he gan to byte
And sayde fortune alas and waylaway
Thin false querel al my woo I wyte
His childer wende þat it for hongir was
That he his armes gnew and nought for wo
And sayden fader do nought so allas
But rather et þe fleisch vpon vs tuo
Oure fleisch þou ȝaue vs  oure fleisch þou take vs fro
And ete ynough right þus þay to him seyde
And after þat wiþinne a day or tuo
Thay layde hem in his lappe adoun and deyde
Himself despeired eek for honger starf
Thus ended is þis mighty eorl of pise
For his estate fortune fro him carf
Of þis tegrede it ought ynough suffise 
whoso wil it hiere in lenger wise
Rede þe gret poet of Itaile
That highte Daunt for he can it deuise
Fro poynt to poynt nouȝt oon word wil he fayle  
Al þough Nero were als vicious
As any fend that lith ful lowe adoun  
Ȝit as tellith vs Swethoneus
This wyde world had in subieccioun
Boþe Est and west and Septemtrioun
Of rubies safers and of perles white
were alle his cloþes embroudid vp and doun
For he in gemmis  gretly gan delite
More delyt more pomp of array
Mor proud was neuer Emperour þan he
That ylke cloth þat he had wered a day
After þat tyme he nolde it neuer se
Nettis of gold þred had he gret plente
To fissche in tyber whan him lust to pleye
his willes were as lawe in his degre
For fortune as his frend wold him obeye
He Rome brent for his delicacie
The senatours he slough vpon a day
To here how men wolde wepe and crye
And slough his broþer  and by his suster lay
his modir made he in pitous array
For hir wombe slyt he to byholde
wher he conceyued so waylaway 
þat he so litel of his moodir tolde
No teer out of his eyen for þat sight
Ne cam but sayde a fair womman was sche
Gret wonder is þat he couþe or might
Be domesman on hir beaute
The wyn to bringen him comaundid he
And drank anoon noon oþer wo he made
whan might is torned vnto cruelte
Allas to deepe wil þe venym wade 
  
IN ȝouþe a maister had þis emperour
To teche him letterure and curtesye
For of moralite he was þe flour
And in his tyme but if þe book lye
And whil his maister had of him maistrie
he made him so connyng and so souple 
That long tyme it was or tyrranye
Or ony vice dorst on him vncouple   
This Seneca of which þat I deuyse
By cause Nero had of him such drede
For fro vices he wolde him chastise
Discretly by word and nouȝt by dede 
Sir wold he sayn an emperour mot neede 
Be vertuous and hate tyrannye
For which he in a bath made him to bleede
On boþe his armes til he moste dye
The nero hadde eek a custumance 
No ȝouþe aȝein his maister for to ryse 
which afterward him þought a gret greuaunce
Therfore he made him deye in þis wise
But naþeles þis Seneca þe wise
Ches in bath to deye in þis manere 
Raþer þan to haue anoþer tyrannye
And þus haþ Nero slayn his maister deere 
Now fel it so þat fortune lust no lenger
The highe pride of Nero to cherice
For þough he were strong ȝit was sche strenger
Sche þoughte þus by god I am to nyce
To set a man þat is ful sad of vice
In high degre and emperour him calle 
By god out of his cite I wil him trice
whan he lest weneþ sonnest schal byfalle
  
The poeple ros on him vpon a night
For heigh defaute and whan he it aspyed
Out of his dores anoon he haþ him dight
Aloone and þer he wende haue ben allyed
he knokked fast and ay þe more he cried
The faster schette þay þe doores alle
Than wist he wel he had himself mysgyed
And went his way no lenger durst he calle
The peple cried and rumbled vp and doun
That with his eris herd he how þay sayde
Wher is þis fals traitour þis neroun
For fere almost out of his witte he brayde 
And to his goddes pitously he prayde 
For socour but it mighte nought betyde   
For drede of þis him þoughte þat he dyde
And ran in to a gardyn hym to hyde
And in þis gardyn fond he cherlis twaye
Sittyng by a fuyr ful greet and reed
And to þese cheles tuo he gan to pray
To sleen him and to girden of his heed
That to his body whan he were deed
were despyt ydoon for his defame
himself he slough he couþe no better reed
Of which fortune þai lough and hadde game 
Was neuer Capitaigne vnder a king 
Thas regnes mo put in subieccioun
Ne strenger was in feld of alle þing
As in his tyme ne gretter of renoun
Ne more pompous in heih presumpcioun
Than Oliphern  which þat fortune ay kist
So licorously  and ladde him vp and doun
Til that his heed was of er he it wist
  
Nought oonly þat þe world had of him awe 
For lesyng of riches and liberte
But made euery man reneye his lawe 
Nabugodonosor was lord sayde he 
Noon oþer god schuld honoured be
Aȝeinst his heste dar no wight trespace
Saue in Betholia a strond cite
wher Eliachim a prest of þat place
But tak keep of þat day of Olipherne
Amyd his ost he dronke lay on night
wiþinne his tente large as is a berne
And ȝit for al his pomp and al his might
Iudith a womman as he lay vpright
Slepyng his heed of smot and fro his tent
Ful priuely sche stal from euery wight
And with his heed vnto hir toun sche went
What needith it of king antiochius
To telle his heye real mageste 
his heyhe pride his werke venemous
For such anoþer was þer noon as he  
Redeþ which þat he was in machabe
And redith þe proude wordes þat he sayde
And why he fel fro his prosperite
And in an hil  how wrecchidly he deyde
Fortune him haþ enhaunced so in pryde
That verraily he wend he might han teyned
Vnto þe sterris vpon euery syde 
And in a balaunce weyen what ech mounteyned
And alle þe floodes of þe see restreyne
And goddes peple had he most in hate
hem wold he slee in torment and in peyne
wenyng þat god ne might his pride abate
  
And for þat Nichosor and Thimothe 
with Iewes were venquist mightily
Vn to þe Iewes such an hate had he 
That he bad graithe his chaar hastily
And swor and sayde ful despitously
Vnto Ierusalem he wold eft soone
To wreke his Ire on it ful cruelly
But of his purpos he was let ful soone
God for his manace him so sore smoot
wiþ inuisible wounde incurable
That in his guttes carf so and bot
That his peynes were importable
And certeynly þe wreche was resonable
For on many a man dede he peyne
But fro his purpos cursed and dampnable 
For al his smert he nolde him nought restreyne 
But bad anoon apparailen his host
And sodeynly er he was of it ware
God dampned al his pride and al his bost
For he so sore fel out of his chare
That his lymes and his skyn totare 
So þat he no more might go ne ryde 
But in a chare men aboute him bare 
Al forbrosed boþe bak and syde 
The wreche of god him smot so cruely
That in his body wicked wormes crept  
And þer with al he stonk so orribly
That noon of his meyne þat him kepe
wheþer þat he wook or elles slepte
Ne mighte nought þe stynk of him endure
In þis meschief he weyled and eek wepte 
And knew god lord of euery creature
  
To al his host and to himself also
Ful wlatsom was þe stynk and þe carayne
No man might him bere to ne fro
And in stynk and orrible payne
he starf ful wrecchedly in a mountayne
Thus haþ þis robbour and þis homicide 
That many a man made wepe and playne 
Swich guerdoun is þat longeþ vnto pryde
The story of alisaunder is so comune
That every wight þat haþ discrecioun
haþ herd som what or al of this fortune
Thys wyde world as in conclusioun
he wan by strengþe or for his heigh renoun
Thay were glad for pees vnto him sende
The pride of man and bost he layd a doun
Wherso he cam vnto þe worldes ende 
Comparisoun ȝit mighte neuer be maked
Bitwen him and noon oþer conquerour
For al þis world for drede of him haþ quaked
he was of knyghthod and of fredam flour
Fortune him made þe heir of hir honour
Saue wyn and wymmen no þing might aswage
his heigh entent in armes and labour
So was he ful of lumyne corage
What pite were it to him þough I ȝow tolde
Of Darius and an hundred þousand mo
Of kynges princes Dukes and eorles bolde 
which he conquered and brouȝt vnto wo
I say as fer as men may ryde or go
The world was his what schold I more deuyse 
    
Of his knighthood it mighte nouȝt suffise 
  
Twelf ȝer he regned as saith machabe  
Philippes son of Macedon he was
That first was king in Crece þat contre
O worþy gentil alisaundre alas
That euer schulde falle such a caas
Empoysoned of þin oughne folk þou were
Thyn fortune is torned in to an aas
And right for þe ne wepte sche neuer a teere
Who schal me ȝiue teeres to compleigne
The deþ of gentiles and of fraunchise
That al þe worlde had in his demeigne
And ȝit him þought it mighte nouȝt suffice
So ful was his corage of high emprise 
Allas who schal helpe me to endite
Fals infortune and poysoun to deuyse
The whiche two al þis wo I wyte
By wisedom manhod and gret labour
Fro humble bed to royal mageste 
Vp roos he Iulius þe conquerour
That wan al thoccident by land and see
By strengþe of hond or elles by trete 
And vnto Rome made hem contributarie
And siþþe of Rome þemperour was he
Til þat fortune wax his aduersarie 
O mighty Cesar þat in Thessalie
Agains pompious fader þin in lawe
That of þe orient had al þe chiualrie
Als fer as þat þe day bigynnes to dawe
Thorugh þi knighthod þou hast him take and slawe
Saue fewe folk þat with pompeus fledde
Þurgh which þou puttist al þorient in awe
Thanke fortune þat so wel þe spedde
  
But now a litel while I wil bywaile
This pompeus þe noble gouernour
Of Rome which þat flowe fro þis bataile
Alas I say oon of his men a fals traitour
his heed of smoot to wynne his fauour
Of Iulius and him þe heed he brouȝt
Alas pomp of þe orient conquerour  
That fortune to such a fyn þe brought
To Rome agayn repaireþ Iulius
wiþ his triumphe laurial ful hye
But on a tyme brutus Cassius
That euer had to his estat enuye 
Ful priuely haþ made conspiracie 
Agains þis Iulius in subtil wise 
Cast the place  in which he schulde dye
with boydekyns as I schal ȝow deuyse 
This Iulius to þe Capitoile went
vpon a day as he was wont to goon
And in þe Capitoil anoon him hent
This false brutus and his oþer foon
And stiked him wiþ boydekyns anoon
with many a wounde and þus þay let him lye
But neuer gront he at no strook but oon
Or elles at tuo but if þe storie lye
So manly was þis Iulius of hert
And so wel loued estatly honeste
That þough his deedly woundes sore smert
his mantil ouer his hipes caste he
For no man schulde seen his priuete
And as he lay deyinge in a traunce
And wiste wel þat verrayly deed was he
Of honeste ȝet had he remembraunce 
  
Lucan to þe þis story I recomende
And to Swetoun and to Valirien also
That al þe story writen word and ende 
how to þese grete conqueroures tuo
Fortune was first frend and siþþen fo
No man trust vpon hir favour longe 
But haue hir in awayt for euermo
witnesse on alle þise conqueroures stronge
Off riche gresus whilom king of lyde
Of which gresus  Cirus him sore dradde 
Ȝet was he caught amyddes al his pride
And to þe fuyr to brenne him men him ladde
But such a rayn doun fro þe heuen schadde  
That slough þe fuyr and made him to eschape
But to be war ȝet grace noon he hadde 
Til fortune on þe galwes made him gape
Whan he was eschaped he couþe nouȝt stent
For to bygynne a newe werre agayn
he wende wel for þat fortune him sent
Such hap þat he eschaped þurgh þe rayn
That of his foos he mighte not be slayn
And eek a sweuen vpon a night he mette
Of which he was so proud and eek so fayn
That in vengeaunce he al his herte sette 
Vpon a tree he was set as him þouȝt
wher Iubiter him wissch boþe bak and side
And phebus eek a fair towail him brouȝt
To drye him with and þerfore wax his pride
And to his douȝter þat stood him biside
which þat he knew in heigh science abounde 
And bad hire telle what it signifyde
And sche his dreem right þus gan expounde 
  
The tree quod sche þe galwes is to mene
And Iubiter likenith snow and rayn
And phebus with his towail so clene
Tho ben þe sonne stremes soþ to sayn
Thow schalt enhangid ben fader certayn
Rayn schal þe wasch and sonne schal þe drye
Thus warned sche him ful plat and ek ful playn
his doughter which þat called was phanie
And hanged was Gresus þis proude king
his real tour might him not auaile 
Tegredis ne noon oþer maner þing
Ne can in I synge crie ny biwayle
But for þat fortune wil alway assayle
wiþ vnwar strook þe regnes þat ben proude
For whan men trusteth hir than wil sche faile
And couer hir brighte face with a clowde
HO sire quod the knight no more of þis  
That ȝe han said is right ynough ywys
And mochil mor  for litel heuynesse
Is right Inough for moche folk I gesse
I say for me it is a gret disease
wher as men han ben in gret welþe and ease
To hieren of her sodeyn fal allas
And þe contraire is ioye and gret solas
As whan a man haþ ben in pore estate
And clymbith vp and wexeþ fortunate
And þer abydeþ in prosperite
Such þing is gladsom as þinkith me
And of such þing were goodly for to telle
ȝe quod our host by seinte paules belle

Right now ȝe herd and pardy no remedye
It is for to bywayle or compleyne
That þat is doon and also it is a peyne
As ȝe han said to hiere of heuynesse 
Sire monk no more of þis  so god ȝour soule blesse
Ȝour tale anoyeth al þis compaignie

For þer Inne is noon disport ne game

Al þough þe slough had neuer ben so deep

Nought helpith it to tellen his sentence
And wel I wot þe substance is in me
If eny þing schal wel reported be
Sir say som what of huntyng I ȝow pray  
Nay quod þe monk I haue no lust to play
Now let another telle as I haue told 
Than spak our ost wiþ rude speche and bold 
And said vnto the nonnes prest anoon 
Come ner þou prest  come ner þou sir Iohn 
Tel vs such þing as may our hertes glade

This sweete prest this goodly man sir Iohn
APore wydow  som del stope in age

In paciens ladde  a ful symple lyf
For litel was hir catel and hir rent
By housbondry  of such as god hir sent
Sche fond hir self and eek hir doughtres tuo
Thre large sowes had sche and no mo
Thre kyn  and eek a scheep þat highte malle
Ful sooty was hir bour and eek hir halle
In which she eet ful many a sclender meel
Of poynaunt saws hir needid neuer a deel
Noon deynteth morsel passid þorugh hir þrote
Hir dyete was accordant to hir cote
Repleccioun ne made hir neuer sik
Attempre dyete was al hir phisik
And exercise and hertes suffisaunce
The goute lette hir no þing for to daunce

No wyn ne drank he noþer whit ne reed  
Hir bord seruyd boþe with whit and blak
Milk and broun bred in which sche fond no lak
Saynd bacoun and som tyme an ey or tweye
For sche was as it were a maner deye
A ȝerd sche had enclosed al aboute

In which she had a Cok þat hight Chaunteclere
In al þe lond of crowyng was noon his peere
  
His vois was merier þan þe mery Orgon
On masse dayes þat in þe chirche goon

By nature knew he ech ascensioun
Of equinoxial in þilke toun
For whan degrees fyftene were ascendid
Thanne crew he it might not ben amendid
His comb was redder þan þe fyn coral
And batayld as it were a castel wal

His nayles whitter þan þe lily flour
And lik þe burnischt gold was his colour
This gentil cok had in his gouernaunce
Seuen hennes for to do al his plesaunce

And wonder lik to him as of coloures
Of whiche þe fairest hiewed on hir þrote

Curteys sche was discret and debonaire
And companable and bar hir self ful faire
Syn þilke day þat sche was seuen ȝer old
That sche haþ trewely þe hert in hold
Of chaunteclere loken in euery lith
He loued hir so þat wel him was þerwith
But such a ioye was it to here him synge
whan þat þe brighte sonne gan to springe
In swete accord my lief is faren on londe
Fro þilke tyme as I haue vnderstonde  
Bestis and briddes cowde speke and synge
And so byfel þat in a dawenynge
As Chaunteclere among his wyues alle 
Sat on his perche þat was in his halle
And next him sat þis faire pertelote
This Chauntecler gan gronen in his þrote
  
As man þat in his dreem is drecched sore 
And whan þat Pertelot þus herd him rore
Sche was agast and sayde herte deere
what eylith ȝow to grone in þis manere
Ȝe ben a verray sleper fy for schame
And he answerd and sayde þus ma dame
I pray ȝow þat ȝe take it nouȝt agreef
By god me mette I was in such meschief
Right now þat ȝit myn hert is sore afright
Now god quod he my sweuen rede aright
And keep my body out of foul prisoun
Me mette how þat I romed vp and doun
wiþinne oure ȝerd wher as I saugh a beest
was lik an hound and wold haue maad arrest
Vpon my body and wold han had me deed
His colour was bitwixe ȝolow and reed
And tipped was his tail and boþe his eeres
with blak vnlik þe remenaunt of his heres
His snowt was smal with glowynge yen tweye
Ȝet of his look for fer almost I deye
This caused me my gronyng douteles
A way quod sche fy on ȝow herteles
Allas quod sche for by þat god aboue
Now haue ȝe lost myn hert and al my loue
I can nought loue a coward by my feith
For certis what so eny womman seith
we alle desiren if it mighte be
To haue housbondes hardy riche and fre
And secre and no nygard ne no fool
Ne him þat is agast of euery tool
Ne noon auaunter by þat god aboue
How dorst ȝe sayn for schame vnto ȝour loue  
That any þing might make ȝow afferd
haue ȝe no mannes hert and han a berd
Allas and can ȝe ben agast of sweuenys
Nought god wot  but vanite in sweuen is
  
Sweuens engendrid ben of replecciouns
And often of fume and of complexiouns
whan humours ben to abundaunt in a wight
Certes þis dreem which ȝe han met tonight
Comeþ of þe grete superfluite
Of ȝoure reede Colera parde
which causeth folk to dremen in here dremes
Of arwes and of fuyr with reede beemes
Of rede bestis þat þai wil him byte 
Of Contek and of whelpis greet and lite
Right as þe humour of malencolie
Causeþ in sleep ful many a man to crye
For fere of beres or of boles blake
Or elles blake deueles wol hem take
Of oþer humours couþe I telle also
That wirken many a man in slep ful woo
But I wol passe as lighty as I can
lo Catoun which þat was so wis a man
Sayde he nouȝt þus ne do no force of dremes
Now sire quod sche whan we fle fro þise beemes
For goddis loue as tak som laxatyf
Vp peril of my soule and of my lyf
I counsel ȝow þe best I wol not lye
    
    
Though in þis toun is noon apotecarie
I schal myself tuo herbes techyn ȝow
That schal be for ȝour hele and for ȝoure prow
And in oure ȝerd þo herbes schal I fynde
The whiche han of her proprete by kynde
To purgen ȝow byneþe and eek aboue
Forget not þis for goddis oughne loue
ȝe ben ful colerik of complexioun
ware þe sonne in his ascencioun
Ne fynd ȝow not replet in humours hote
And if it do I dar wel lay a grote    
That ȝe schul haue a feuer terciane
Or an agu þat may be ȝoure bane
A day or tuo ȝe schul haue digestiues
Of wormes er ȝe take ȝour laxatiues
Of lauriol Century and fumytere
Or elles of Elder bery þat growith þere 
Of Catapus or of gaytre berijs
Of erbe yue groweþ in our ȝerd þer mery is
Pike hem vpright as þay growe and et hem In ·
Be mery housbond for ȝour fader kyn
Drediþ non dremes I can say no more
Ma dame quod he graunt mercy of ȝour lore
But naþeles as touching daun Catoun
That hath of wisdom such a gret renoun
Though þat he bad no dremes for to drede
By god men may in olde bookes rede
Of many a man more of auctorite
That euer catoun was so mot I the
That al þe reuers sayn of his sentence
And han wel founden by experience
That dremes ben significaciouns
As wel of ioye as of tribulaciouns
That folk enduren in þis lif present
Ther nedeth make of þis noon argument
The verray preue schewith it in dede
Oon of þe grettest auctorite þat men rede
Saith þus · þat whilom tway felawes wente
On pylgrimage in a ful good entente 
And happed so þay com in to a toun
wher as þer was such congregacioun
Of people and eek so streyt of herbergage
þat þay fond nouȝt as moche as oon cotage 
In which þat þay might boþe Ilogged be
wherfor þay mosten of necessite
As for þat night depart her compaignye
And ech of hem goþ to his hostelrye
  
And took his loggyng as it wolde falle
That oon of hem was loggid in a stalle  
Fer in a ȝerd with oxen of þe plough
That oþer man was logged wel ynough
As was his aduenture or fortune
That vs gouernith alle in comune
And so bifel þat long er it were day
This oon met in his bed þer as he lay
how þat his felaw gan vpon him calle
And sayd allas for in an oxe stalle 
This night I schal be murdrid þer I lye
Now help me deere broþer or I dye
In alle cum to me he sayde
This man out of his slep for fer abrayde
But whan þat he was waked out of his sleep
he torned him and took of þis no keep
him þought him dreem nas but a vanite 
Thus twies in his sleepe dremed he
And at þe þridde tyme ȝet his felawe
Com as him þought and sayd I am now slawe
Bihold my bloody woundes deep and wyde
Arise vp erly in þe morwe tyde 
And at the west gate of þe toun quod he 
A cart of donge þere schalt þou see
In which my body is hyd priuely
Do þilke cart arresten boldely
My gold caused my mourdre soþ to sayn
And told him euery poynt how he was slayn
with a ful pitous face pale of hewe
And truste wel his dreem he fond ful trewe 
For on þe morwe as sone as it was day
To his felawes In he took þe way
And whan þat he cam to þis oxe stalle
After his felaw he bigan to calle 
The hostiller answered him anoon
And sayde sire ȝour felaw is agoon
  
Als soone as day he went out of þe toun
This man gan falle in a suspeccioun
Remembring on his dremes þat he mette 
And forth he goth no lenger wold he lette  
Vnto þe west gate of þe toun and fond
A dong cart went as it were to donge lond
That was arrayed in þe same wise
As ȝe han herd þe deede man deuise 
And with an hardy hert he gan to crie
Vengeaunce and iustice of þis felonye
My felaw mordrid is þis same night
And in þis carte  he lith heer vpright
I crye out on þe ministres quod he 
That schulde kepe and reule þis Cite
harrow allas her lith my felaw slayn
what schold I more vnto þis tale sayn
The peple vpstert and caste þe carte to grounde 
And in þe myddes of þe dong þay founde
The dede man þat mordred was al newe 
O blisful god þou art ful iust and trewe
Lo how þow bywreyest mordre al day
Mordre wil out certes it is no nay
Morder is so wlatsom and abhominable
To god that is so iust and resonable
That he ne wold nouȝt suffre it hiled be
Though it abyde a ȝeer or tuo or þre
Morder wil out þis is my conclusioun
And right anoon þe mynistres of þat toun
Han hent þe carter and so sore him pyned
And eek the hostiller so sore engyned
That þay biknew her wikkednes anoon
And were anhonged by þe nekke boon
Here may men se þat dremys ben to drede
And Certes in þe same book I rede
Right in þe nexte Chapitre after þis
I gabbe nought so haue I ioye or bliss
  
Tuo men þat wolde haue passed ouer see 
For certeyn causes into fer cuntre
If þat þe wynd ne hadde ben contrarie
That made hem in a Cite for to tarie
That stood ful mery vpon an hauen syde 
But on a day agayn þe euen tyde  
The wynd gan chaunge and  right as him list
Iolyf and glad þey wenten vnto rest
And casten hem ful erly for to sayle
But herkneþ to þat oon man fel a gret meruayle
That oon of hem in his slepyng as he lay
him met a wonder drem agayn þe day
him þought a man stood by his beddes syd
And him comaunded þat he schuld abyde
And sayd him þus if þou to morwe wende
Thow schalt be dreynt my tale is at an ende
 He wook and told his felaw what he mette
And prayde him his viage to lette
As for þat day he prayd him to abyde
his felaw þat lay by his beddis syde
Gan to lawgh and scorned him ful fast
No dreem quod he may so myn herte gaste 
That I wil lette for to do my þinges
I sette not a straw by þy dremynges
For sweuens been but vanitees and iapes
Men dreme al day of owles and of apes
And eke of many a mase þer with al
Men dreme of þinges þat neuer be schal
But sith I see þat þou wilt her abyde 
And þus forslouthe wilfully þy tyde
God wot it reweth me and haue good day
And þus he took his leue and went his way
But er he hadde half his cours Isayled
Noot I nouȝt why ne what meschaunce it ayled
But casuelly þe schippes bothom rent
And schip and man vnder þe watir went
  
In sight of oþer schippes þer byside
That with him sailed at þe same tyde
And þerfore faire pertelot so deere
By such ensamples olde maistow leere
That no man scholde be to recheles
Of dremes for I say þe douteles
That many a dreem ful sore is for to drede
Lo in þe lif of seint kenelm I rede  
That was kenulphus sone þat noble king
Of mertinrike how kenilm mette a þing
A lutil he was mordred vpon a day
His mordre in his auysioun he say
His norice him expouned euerydel
His sweuen and bad him for to kepe him wel
For traisoun for he nas but seuen ȝer old
And þerfore litel tale haþ he told
Of eny drem so holy was his hert
By god I hadde leuer þan my schert
þat ȝe had rad his legend as haue I
Dame pertelot I say ȝow trewely
Macrobius þat writ þe avisioun
In auffrik of þe worþy Cipioun
Affermeþ dremes and saith þat þay been
Warnyng of þinges þat men after seen
And forþermore I pray ȝow lokeþ wel
In þe olde testament of Daniel
If he huld dremes eny vanyte 
Rede eek of Ioseph and þer schal ȝe see 
wheþir dremes ben som tyme I say nought alle
warnyng of þinges þat schul after falle
Lok of Egipt þe king daun pharao
his baker and his botiler also
whethir þay felte noon effect in dremis
whoso wol seke actes of sondry remys
May rede of dremes many a sondry þing
Lo Cresus which þat was of lydes king
  
Mette þat he sat vpon a tre
which signified he schuld hanged be 
Lo hir andromachia Ectors wif
That day þat Ector schulde lese his lif
Sche dremed on þe same night byforn
how þat þe lif of Ector schulde be lorn
If þilke day he wente to batayle 
Sche warned him but it might nouȝt auaile 
He wente forþ to fighte naþeles
But he was slayn anoon of achilles  
But þilke tale is al to long to telle
And eek it is neigh day I may not duelle
Schortly I say as for conclusioun
That I schal haue of þis auisioun
Aduersite and I say forþermore
That I ne telle of laxatifs no store
For þay ben venemous I wot it wel
I hem defye I loue hem neuer a del
Now let vs speke of mirthe and lete al þis
Madame pertilot so haue I blis
Of o þing god haþ me sent large grace
For whan I see þe beaute of ȝour face
Ȝe ben so scarlet hiew about ȝour eyȝen
hit makith al my drede for to deyȝen
For als siker as In principio
Mulier est hominis confusio
Madame þe sentence of þis latyn is
womman is mannes ioye and mannes blis
For when I fiele anight ȝour softe syde 
Al be it þat I may not on ȝou ryde
For þat ȝour perche is mad so narrow allas 
I am so ful of ioye and solas
That I defye boþ sweuen and drem
And with þat word he fleigh doun fro þe beem
For it was day and eek his hennes alle
with a chuk he gan hem for to calle 
  
For he had found a corn lay in þe ȝerd
Real he was he was nomore aferd
he fetherid pertelote twenty tyme
And trad as ofte er þat it was prime
he lokith as it were a grim lioun
And on his toon he romeþ vp and doun
him deyneth not to set his foot to grounde
And chukkiþ whan he haþ a corn Ifounde
And to him rennen þan his wifes alle
Thus real as a prince is in his halle
 Leue I þis Chauntecler in his pasture
And after wol I telle his aduenture  
whan þat þe moneth in which þe world bigan
That highte march whan god maked first man
was complet and passed were also
Syn march bygan tway monþes and dayes tuo
Byfell þat Chauntecler in al his pride
His seuen wyues walkyng by his syde
Cast vp his eyȝen to þe brighte sonne
That in þe signe of Taurus had Ironne
Twenty degrees and oon and som what more
And knew by kynde and by noon oþer lore
þat it was prime and crew with blisful steuen
The sonne he sayde is clomben vpon heuen
Twenty degrees and oon and som what more Iwis
Ma dame pertelot my worldes blis
Herknith þese blisful briddes how þay synge 
And seth þese freissche floures how þay springe
Ful is myn hert of reuel and solaas
But sodeinly him fel a sorwful caas
For euer þe latter end of ioye is wo
God wot þat worldly ioye is soone ago
And if  Rethor couþe faire endite
hem a Cronique saufly might he write
As for a souerayn notabilite
Now euery wys man let him herkne me
  
This story is also trewe I vndertake
As þe book is of Launcelot þe lake
That womman huld in ful gret reuerence
Now wol I torne agayn to my sentence
A Colefox ful  sleigh of iniquite
That in þe groue had woned ȝeres þre
By heigh ymaginacioun forncast
The same nighte þurgh þe hegge brast
In to þe ȝerd þer Chaunteclere þe faire
was went and eek his wyues to repaire
And in a bed of wortes stille he lay
Til it was passed vndern of þe day
waytyng his tyme on Chaunteclere to falle 
As gladly doon þese homicides alle  
That in awayte lyn to morther men
O false mordrer lurkyng in þy den
O newe Scariot newe Genilon
Fals dissimilour greke Synon
That broughtest troye al outrely to sorwe
O Chauntecler O cursed be þe morwe
That þou in to þe ȝerd flough fro þe bemys
Thow were ful wel Iwarned by þy dremys
That þilke day was perilous to þe
But what þat god forwot most needes be 
After þe opynyoun of certeyn clerkis
witnesse on him þat eny clerk is
That in scole is gret altercacioun
In þis matier and gret desputesoun
And hath ben of an hundred þousend men
But ȝit I can not bult it to þe bren
As can þe holy doctor augustyn
Or boece or þe bisshop Bradwardyn
Wheþer þat goddis worþy forwetyng
Streigneth me needely for to do a þing
Needely clepe I simple necessite
Or elles if fre choys be graunted me
  
To do þat same þing or to do it nouȝt
Though god forwot it er þat it was wrought
Or of his wityng streyneþ neuer a deel
But by necessite condicionel
I wol not haue to do of such matiere
My tale is of a Cok as ȝe schal hiere
That took his counseil of his wyf with sorwe 
To walken in þe ȝerd vpon þe morwe
That he had met þe dreme þat I tolde
wymmens counseiles ben fulofte colde
wommannes counseil brouȝt vs first to woo
And made adam fro paradys to go
Ther as he was ful mery and wel at ease
But for I not to him it might displease
If I counseil of womman wolde blame
Pas ouer for I sayd it in my game  
Red auctours wher þay trete of such matiere
And what þay sayn of wommen ȝe may heere
These ben þe cokkes wordes and not myne
I can  noon harme  of wommen diuine 
Faire in þe sond to baþe hir merily
lith pertelot and alle hir sustres by
Agayn þe sonne and Chaunteclere so free
Sang merier þan þe meremayd in þe see
For phisiologus seith sicurly
how þat þay syngen wel and merily
And so byfel þat as he cast his ye
Among þe wortes on a boterflye
he was war of þis fox þat lay ful lowe
No þing ne list him þanne for to crowe
But cryde anoon cok cok and vp he stert
As man þat was affrayed in his hert
For naturelly a beest desireth flee
Fro his contrarie if  he may it see
þough he neuer er had sayn it with his ye
þis Chaunteclere whan he gan it aspye
  
he wold han fled but þat þe fox anon
Said gentil sire  allas why wol ȝe goon
Be ȝe affrayd of me þat am ȝoure frend
Certes I were worse þan any feend
If I to ȝow wold harm or vilonye
I am nouȝt come ȝour counsail to espye
    
    
But trewely ȝe haue als mery a steuen
As eny aungel hath þat is in heuen
Ther wiþ ȝe han in musik more felynge
Than had Boece or eny þat can synge
My lord ȝour fader god his soule blesse 
And ȝoure moder of her gentilesse
han in myn hous Ibeen to my gret ease
And Certes sire ful fayn wold I ȝow please
But for men speke of syngyng I wol say
So mot I brouke wel myn yen tway
Saue ȝe I herde neuer man so synge
As dede ȝour fadir in þe morwenynge  
Certes it was of hert al þat he song
And for to make his vois þe more strong
he wold so peynen him þat wiþ boþe his yen
he moste wynke so lowde he wolde crien
And stonden on his typtoon þer wiþ al
And streche forth his necke long and smal
And eek he was of such discressioun
That þer nas no man in no regioun
That him in song or wisdom mighte passe
I haue wel rad in Daun Burnel thasse
Among his verses how þer was a Cok
For a prestes sone ȝaf him a knok
vpon his leg whil he was ȝong and nyce
He made him for to lese his benefice
But certeyn þer is no comparisoun
Bitwix þe wisdom and discressioun
  
Of ȝoure fader and of his subtilte
Now syngeþ sire for seinte charite
let se can ȝe ȝour fader countrefete
This Chanteclere his wynges gan to bete
As man that couþe his tresoun nought espye
So was he rauyssht wiþ his flaterie
Allas lordynges many a fals flatour
Is in ȝour hous and many a losengour
That pleasen ȝow wel more by my faith
Than he þat soþfastnesse vnto ȝow saith
Rediþ Ecclesiast of flaterie
Beþ war ȝe lordes of her treccherie 
This Chaunteclere stood heihe vpon his toos
Strecching his necke and his yhen cloos
And gan to crowe lowde for þe noones
And daun Russel þe fox stert vp at oones
And by þe garget hente Chaunteclere
And on his bak toward þe woode him bere
For ȝit was þere  no man þat him sewed
O desteny þat maist not ben eschiewed
Allas þat Chaunteclere fleigh fro þe bemis
Allas his wif roughte nought of dremis  
And on a friday fel al þis meschaunce
O venus þat art god of pleasaunce
Syn þat þy seruant was þis Chaunteclere
And in þy seruice did al his powere
More for delit þan þe world to multiplie
why woldest þou suffre him on þy day to dye
O gaufred dere mayster souerayn
That whan þe worþy king Richard was slayn
with schot compleynedist his deþ so sore
why ne had I nouȝt þy sentence and þy lore
þe friday for to chiden as dede ȝe
For on a fryday soþly slayn was he
Than wold I schewe how þat I couþe pleyne 
For Chauntecleres drede and for his peyne
  
Certis such cry ne lamentacioun
was neuer of ladies maad whan Ilioun
was wonne and pirrus with his strit swerd
whan he hente kyng priam by þe berd
And slough him as saith vs Eneydos
As maden alle þe hennes in þe clos
whan þay had sayn of Chauntecler þe sight
Nought soueraignly  dam pertelote schright
Ful lowder þan did hasdrubaldes wyf
whan þat hir housebond had lost his lyf
And þat þe Romayns had Ibrent Cartage
Sche was so ful of torment and of rage 
That wilfully vnto þe fuyr sche stert
And brend hir seluen with a stedfast hert
O woful hennes right so cride ȝe
As whan þat Nero brente þe cite
Of Rome criden þe senatoures wyues
For þat her housbondes losten alle here lyues
wiþouten gult þis nero hath hem slayn
Now wol I torne to my matier agayn
 The sely wydow and hir doughtres tuo
herden þese hennys crie and maken wo
And out at dores starte þay anoon
And sayden þe fox toward þe woode is goon  
And bar vpon his bak þe cok away
And criden out harrow and wayleway
ha  ha  þe fox and after him þay ran
And eek with staues many anoþer man
Ran Colle our dogge and talbot and Garlond
And Malkyn wiþ a distaf in hir hond
Ran cow and calf and þe verray hoggoes
So were þey fered for berkyng of dogges
And schowtyng of þe men and wymmen eke
Þay ronne þat þay þought her herte breke
Thay ȝelleden as feeldes doon in helle
The dokes criden as men wold hem quelle
  
The gees for fere flowen ouer þe trees
Out of þe hyues cam þe swarm of bees
So hidous was þe noyse a benedicite
Certes þough Iakke straw and his meyne
Ne maden schoutes neuer half so schrille
whan þat þay wolden eny flemyng kille 
As þilke day was maad vpon þe fox
Of bras þay brough hornes and of box
Of horn of boon in which þay blew and powped
And þer with al thay schryked and þay howped
It semed as þat heuen schulde falle
Now goode men I pray herkneþ alle 
lo how fortune torneþ sodeinly
The hope and pride eek of her enuy
This Cok þat lay vpon þis foxes bak
In al his drede vnto the fox he spak
And saide sire if þat I were as ȝe
Ȝet schuld I sayn as wis god helpe me
Turneþ aȝein ȝe proude cherles alle
A verray pestilens vpon ȝow falle 
Now am I come vnto þis woodes syde 
Maugre ȝoure heed þe Cok schal heer abyde
I wol him ete in faith and þat anoon
The Fox answerd in faith it schal be doon
And whil he spak þat word al sodeinly
This Cok brak from his mouth delyuerly  
And heigh vpon a tree he fleigh anoon
And whan þe fox seigh þat he was Igoon
Allas quod he o Chaunteclere allas
I haue to ȝow quod he ydon trespas
In as moche as I makid ȝow aferd
whan I ȝow hent and brouȝt out of þe ȝerd
But sire I dede it in no wicked entent
Com doun and I schal telle ȝow what I ment
I schal say soþ to ȝow god help me so
Nay þan quod he I schrew vs boþe tuo
  
And first I schrew my self boþe blood and boones
If þou bigile me any ofter þan oones
Thou schalt no more þurgh þy flaterye
Do me to synge and wynke with myn ye
For he þat wynkith whan he scholde se
Al wilfully god let him neuer the
Nay quod þe Fox but god ȝiue him meschaunce 
þat is so vndiscret of gouernaunce 
þat iangleth whan he scholde holde his pees
Lo such it is for to be recheles
And necligent and trust on flaterie 
But ȝe þat holde  þis tale a folye 
As of a Fox or of a cok or of an hen
Takith þe moralite goode men
For seint poul saiþ þat al þat writen is
To oure doctrine it is Iwrite Iwys
Takith þe fruyt and let þe chaf be stille
Now goode god if þat it be þy wille
As saith my lor so make vs alle good men
And bring vs alle to his blisse ameN
WOt ȝe not wher þer stont a litel toun
which þat cleped is Bob vp and doun
vnder þe Ble in Caunterbury way
Ther gan our hoste for to iape and play
And sayde sires what dun is in þe myre
Is þer no man for prayer ne for hyre  
Thal wol awake our felawes al byhynde
A theef mighte ful lightly robbe and bynde
Se how he nappith se for goddes boones
That he wol falle fro his hors at ones
Is þat a Cook of londoun wiþ meschaunce 
Do him come forth he knoweth his penaunce 
For he schal telle a tale by my fay
Al þough it be nouȝt worþ a botel hay
Awake þou Cook sit vp god ȝif þe sorwe
what eyleþ þe to slepe by þe morwe 
Hast þou had fleen al night or artow dronke
Or hastow with some quen al night Iswonke
So þat þou maist not holden vp þyn heed
This cook þat was pale and no þing reed
Sayd to our host so god my soule blesse 
As þer is falle on me such heuynesse
Not I nouȝt why þat me were leuer slepe 
Than þe beste galoun wyn in Chepe 
  
 wel quod þe maunciple if þat I may doon ease 
To þe sir Cook and to no wiȝt displease 
which þat her rydeþ in þis compaignye
And our host wolde of his curteisie
I wol as now excuse þe of þy tale
For in good faith þi visage is ful pale

And wel I woot þy breth ful foule stynkith
That scheweþ eek þou art nought wel disposid
Of me certeyn þou schalt nouȝt ben Iglosed

As þough he wolde swolwe vs anoon right

The deuel of helle sette his foot þer Inne
Thy cursed breth effecte wil vs alle
Fy stynkyng swyne foule mot þe falle
A takiþ heed sires of þis lusty man
Now swete sir wol ȝe ioust atte fan
Therto me þinkþ ȝe beþ right wel Ischape
I trowe þa ȝe dronken han wyn ape  
And þat whan men playen with a straw
And with his speche þe cook wax angry and wraw
And on þe maunciple bygan he nodde fast
For lak of speche and doun þe hors him cast
wher as he lay til þat men him up took
This was a fair Chiuache of a cook
Allas þat he nad hold him by his ladil
And er þat he agayn were in his sadil
Ther was gret schowuyng boþe to and fro
To lift him vp and moche care and wo
So vnwelde was þis sory pallid gost
And to þe maunciple þanne spak oure host
By cause drink hath dominacioun
Vpon þis man by my sauacioun
I trow he lewedly tel wol his tale
For were it wyn or old moysty ale
  
þat he haþ dronk he spekiþ in his nose 
And fnesith fast and eek he haþ þe pose
he also to do more þan ynough
To kepe him and his Capil out of þe slough
And if he falle fro his capil eft sone
þan schal we alle haue ynough to doone
In liftyng vp his heuy dronken cors
Tel on thy tale of him make I no fors
But ȝit maunciple in faith þou art to nyce
Thus openly reproeue him of his vice
Anoþer day he wil par aduenture
Reclayme þe and bringe þe to lure
I mene he speke wol of smale þinges
As for to pynchyn at þy rekenynges
That were not honest if it cam to pref
Quod þe maunciple þat were a gret meschief
So might he lightly bringe me in þe snare
Ȝit had I leuer payen for þe mare
which he ryt on þan he schulde with me stryue
I wil not wrath him al so mot I þriue
That at I spak I sayd it in my bourde
And wite ȝe what I haue heer in a gourde  
A draught of wyn is of a ripe grape 
And right anoon ȝe schal se a good iape
þis Cook schal drinke þerof if I may
vp peyn of deth he wol nouȝt say me nay
And certeinly to tellen as it was 
Of þis vessel þe cook dronk fast allas
what needid it he drank ynough biforn
And whan he hadde pouped in his horn
To þe maunciple he took þe gourd agayn
And of þat draught þe cook was wonder fayn
And þanked him in such wise as he couþe 
Than gan our host to laughe wonder louthe 
And sayd I se wel it is necessarie
wher þat we go good drynk wiþ vs to carie
  
For þat wol torne rancour and desese
To accord and loue and many racour pese 
O þou bacus Iblessid be þin name
That so canst torne ernest in to game
worschip and þonke be to þy deite
Of þat matier ȝe get no more of me
Tel on þi tale mauncipel I þe pray
wel sir quod he now herkyn what I say
Whan phebus duelt her in þis erþe a doun
As olde bookes maken mencioun
He was þe moste lusty bachiler
Of al þis world and eek þe best archer
He slough phiton þe serpent as he lay
Slepyng agayn þe sonne vpon a day
And many another noble worþy dede
He with his bowe wrought as men may rede 
Pleyen he couþe on euery mynstralcye
And syngen þat it was a melodye
To heren of his cleere vois þe soun
Certes þe kyng of Thebes amphioun
That with his singyng wallid þat citee
Couþe neuer synge half so wel as he 
Therto he was þe semlieste man
That is or was siþþen þe world bigan  
what nediþ it his fortune to descriue
For in þis worlde is noon such on lyue
he was þer with fulfild of gentilesce
Of honour and of parfyt worþinesse
This phebus þat was flour of bachilerie
Als wel in fredom as in chiualrie
For to disport in signe of victorie
Of phiton so as telleþ vs þe storie
was wont to bere in his hond a bowe
Now had þis phebus in his hous a crowe
which in a cage he fostred many a day
And taught it speken as men doon a iay
  
whit was þis crowe as is a snowwhyt swan
And countrefete the speche of euery man
he couþe whan he schulde telle a tale
Ther is wiþinne þis world no nightingale
Ne couþe by an hundred þousend del
Singe so wonder merily and wel
Now had þis phebus in his hous a wyf
which þat he loued more þan his lif
And night and day did euermor diligence 
hir for to please and doon hir reuerence
Sauf oonly if þe soþ þat I schal sayn
Ialous he was and wold haue kept hir fayn
For him were loth biiaped for to be 
And so is euery wight in such degre
But al for nought for it auaileth nouȝt
A good wyf þat is clene of werk and thought
Schuld not be kept in noon awayt certayn
And trewely þe labour is in vayn
To kepe a schrewe for it wil nought be
This hold I for a verray nycete
To spille labour for to kepe wyues
Thus olde clerkes writen in her lyues
But now to purpos as I first bigan
This worþi phebus doþ al þat he can
To pleasen hir wenyng by such plesaunce 
And for his manhod and his gouernaunce  
That no man schuld han put him fro hir grace
But god it woot þer may no man embrace
As to destroy a þing þe which nature
haþ naturelly set in a creature
Tak any brid and put him in a cage
And do al þin entent and þy corrage
To foster it tenderly wiþ mete and drynk
And wiþ alle þe deyntees þou canst þink
And keep it al so kyndly as þou may
Al þough his cage of gold be neuer so gay
  
Ȝit haþ þis brid by twenty þousand fold
Leuer to be in forest wyd and cold
Gon ete wormes and such wrecchidnes
For euer þis brid wil doon his busynes
To scape out of his cage whan he may
his liberte þe brid desireth ay
let take a cat and foster him wel wiþ mylk
And tender fleisch and mak his bed of silk
And let him see a mous go by þe wal
Anoon he wayueth mylk and fleisch and al
And euery deynte which is in þat hous
Such appetit haþ he to ete þe mous
lo heer haþ lust his dominacioun
And appetit flemeth discrscioun
Also a sche wolf haþ a vilayns kynde 
The lewidest wolf þat sche may fynde
Or lest of reputacioun him wol sche take
In tyme whan hir lust to haue a make
Alle þis ensamples tel I by þis men
That ben vntrewe and no þing by wommen
For men han euer a licorous appetit
On lower þing to parforme her delit
Than on her wyues ben þay neuer so faire
Ne neuer so trewe ne so debonaire
Fleissch is so newfangil with meschaunce
That we can in no þinge haue plesaunce
That souneþ in to vertu eny while
This phebus which þat þought vpon no gile  
Deceyued was for al his iolite
For vnder him anoþer hadde sche
A man of litil reputacioun
Nought worþ to phebus in comparisoun
Mor harm it is it happeth ofte so
Of which þer comeþ boþe harm and woo
And so bifel whan phebus was absent
His wif anoon hath for hir lemman sent
  
hir lemman certes þis is a knauisch speche
Forȝiueþ it me and þat I ȝow biseche
The wise plato saith as ȝe may rede
þe word mot neede accorde wiþ þe dede
If men schal telle propurly a þing
The word mot corde wiþ þe þing werkyng
I am a boystous  right thus say I
There is no difference trewely
Bytwix a wyf þat is of heigh degre 
If of hir body dishonest sche be
And a pore wenche oþer þen þis
If so be þay werke boþe amys
But the gentil in estat aboue
Sche schal be cleped his lady as in loue
And for þat oþer is a pore womman
Sche schal be cleped his wenche and his lemman
And god it wot my goode lieue broþer
Men layn þat oon as lowe as þat oþer
Right so betwixe atticles tirant
And an outlawe or a þef erraunt
The same I say þer is no difference
To alisaunder told was þis sentence
þat for þe tiraunt is of gretter might
Bi force of meyne for to sle doun right
And brenne hous and home and make al playn
Lo þerfor is he cleped a Captayn
And for an outlawe haþ so smal meyne
And may not doon so gret an harm as he
Ne bringe a contre to so gret meschief 
Men clepen him an outlawe or a þeef  
But for I am a man not texted wel
I wil not telle of textes neuer a del
I wol go to my tale as I bigan
whan phebus wyf had sent for hir lemman
Anon þay wrouȝten al her wil volage
This white crow  þat heng alway in cage
  
Bihild her werk and sayde neuer a word
And whan þat hom was come phebus þe lord
This Crowe song Cuckow Cockow Cuckow
what bird quod phebus what song syngistow
Ne were þou wont so merily to synge
That to myn hert it was a reioysynge
To here þi vois allas what song is þis
By god quod he I synge not amys
Phebus quod he for al þy worþynes
For al þy beaute and þy gentiles
For alle þy songes and þy menstralcie 
For al þy waytyng blered is þin ye 
with oon of litel reputacioun
Nought worth to þe as in comparisoun
The mountauns of a gnat so mot I þriue
For on þy bed þy wif I saugh him swyue
what wol ȝe more þe crowe anoon him tolde 
By sadde toknes and by wordes bolde
how þat his wyf had doon hir leccherie
him to gret schame and to gret vilonye
And told him oft he saugh it wiþ his yen
This phebus gan awayward for to wryen
him þought his sorwful herte brast on tuo
his bowe he bent and sett þerIn a flo
And in his ire he haþ his wif Islayn
þis is þeffect þer is no more to sayn
For sorw of which he brak his menstralcye
Boþe harp gitern and sauterie
And eek he brak his arwes and his bowe
And after þat þus spak he to þe crowe
Traytour quod he wiþ tunge of scorpioun
Thow hast me brought to my confusioun  
Allas þat I was born why nere I deed
O dere wyf O gemme of lustyhed
That were to me so sad and eek so trewe
Now list þou deed with face pale of hewe
  
Ful gulteles þat dorst I swere Iwis
O racle hond to do so foule amys
O trouble wit O Ire recheles
That vnauysed smytest gulteles
O wantrust ful of fals suspeccioun
wher was þy wit and þy discrecioun
O euery man be war of raclenesse
Ne trowe no þing wiþoute gret witnesse
Smyt nouȝt to soone er þat þou wite why 
And be auysed wel and sobrely
Er ȝe doon eny execucioun
Vpon ȝour Ire for suspeccioun
Allas a þousand folk haþ racle Ire
Fordoon or dun hath brouȝt hem in þe myre
Allas for sorw  I wil my seluen sle
And to þe crowe o false þeef sayd he
I wyl þe quyt anoon þy false tale 
Thow songe whilom as any nightyngale 
Now schaltow false þef þy song forgoon
And eek þy white fetheres euerich oon
Ne neuer in al þy lyf ne schaltow speke
Thus schal men on a fals þeef ben awreke
Thou and þin ospring euer schuln be blake
Ne neuer sweete noyse schul ȝe make
But euer crye agayn tempest and rayn
In tokenyng þat þurgh þe my wyf was slayn
And to þe crowe he stert and þat anoon
And puld his white feþeres euerychoon
And made him blak and raft him al his song
And eek his speche and out at dore him slong
vnto þe deuel which I him bytake
And for þis cause ben alle crowes blake
Lordyngs by þis ensample I ȝow pray
Beth war and takeþ kepe what ȝe say   
Ne tellith neuer man in al ȝoure lif
how þat anoþer man haþ dight his wyf
  
he wol ȝou hatin mortelly certeyn
Daun Salamon as wise clerkes seyn
Techeþ a man to kepe his tonge wel
But as I sayd I am nought tixted wel
But naþeles þus taughte me my dame
My sone thenk on þe crowe in goddes name
My son keep wel þy tonge and kep þy frend
A wicked tonge is worse þan a feend
My sone fro a feend men may hem blesse
My sone god of his endeles goodnesse
wallid a tonge wiþ teeþ and lippes eek
For man schal him auyse what he speek
My sone ful ofte for to mochil speche 
haþ many a man be spilt as clerkes teche
But for a litil speche auisily
Is no man schent to speke generally
My sone þy tonge scholdest þou restreigne
At alle tyme but whan þou dost þy peyne 
To speke of god in honour and prayere
The firste vertu sone if þou wilt lere
Is to restreigne and kepe wel þy tonge
Thus lerne clerkes whan þat þay ben ȝonge
My sone of mochil speking euel auised
Ther lasse speking had ynough suffised
Comeþ mochil harm þus was me told and taught
In mochel speche synne wantiþ nought
wost wher of a racle tonge serueþ
Right a swerd forkutteþ and kerueþ
An arm a tuo my dere sone right so
A tonge cutteth frendschip al a tuo
A iangler is to god abhominable
Red Salamon so wys and honurable
Red Dauid in his psalmes reed Senek
My sone spek not but wiþ þy heed þu bek
Dissimul as þou were deed if þat þou heere
A iangler speke of perilous mateere    
The flemyng saiþ and lere it if þe lest 
That litil iangling causeþ mochil rest
My sone if þou no wikked word hast sayd
The thar not drede for to be bywrayd
But he þat haþ mys sayd I dar wel sayn
he may by no way clepe his word agayn
Thing þat is sayd is sayd and forþ it goþ
Though him repent or be him neuer so loþ
He is his þral to whom þat he haþ sayd
A tale of which he is now yuel a payd
My sone be war and be noon auctour newe 
Of tydyngs wheþer þay ben fals or trewe 
wherso þou comest amonges heih or lowe 
kep wel þy tonge  and thenk vpon þe crowe
By þat þe maunciple had had his tale endid
The sonne fro þe south line is descendid
So lowe þat it nas nouȝt to my sight
Degrees 
Ten on þe Clokke it was as I gesse 
For enleuen foote or litil more or lesse 
My schadow was at þilk tyme of þe ȝere
Of which feet as my lengþe parted were 
In  feet equal of proporcioun
Therwith þe mones exaltacioun
In mena libra alway gan ascende
As we were entryng at a townes ende
For which our host as he was wont to gye
As in þis caas our ioly compaignye
Sayd in þis wise lordings euerich oon
Now lakkeþ vs no moo tales þan oon
Fulfilled is my sentens and my decre
I trowe þat we han herd of ech degre
Almost fulfilled is myn ordynaunce
I pray to god so ȝeue him right good chaunce
That tellith to vs his tale lustily
Sire prest quod he artow a vicory  
Or artow a persoun say soþ by þy fay
Be what þou be breke nought oure play
  
For euery man saue þou hath told his tale
vnbocle and schew vs what is in þy male
For trewely me þinkeþ by þy chier
Þou scholdist wel knyt vp a gret matier
Tel vs a tale anoon for cokkes boones
This persoun answerde al at oones 
Thow getist fable noon Itold for me
For poul þat writes vnto thimothe
Repreueþ hem þat weyueþ sothfastnesse
And tellen fables and such wrecchednesse 
why schuld I sowen draf out of my fest
whan I may sowe whete if þat me lest
For which I say if þat ȝow lust to hiere
Moralite and vertuous matiere
And þanne þat ȝe wil ȝiue me audience
I wol ful fayn at cristis reuerence
Do ȝow plesaunce leful as I can
But trusteþ wel I am a suthern man
I can not geste rum raf ruf by letter
Ne god wot rym hold I but litel better
And þerfor if ȝow lust I wol not glose
I wol ȝow telle a mery tale in prose 
To knyt vp al this fest and make an ende
And Ihū for his grace wit me sende
To schewe ȝow þe way in þis viage
Of þilke parfyt glorious pilgrimage
That hatte Ierusalem celestial
And if ȝe vouche sauf anoon I schal
Bygynne my tale for which I ȝow pray
Telle ȝour avis I can no better say
But naþeles þis meditacioun
I put it ay vnder correctioun
Of clerkes for I am not textuel
I take but þe sentens trustiþ wel
Therfor I make protestacioun
That I wol stonde to correccioun    
Vpon þis word we han assented soone
For as it semed it was for to done
To enden in som vertuous sentence
And for to ȝeue him space and audience
And bad oure host he schulde to him say
That alle we to telle his tale him pray
Our host hadde þe wordes for vs alle
Sir prest quod he now faire ȝow bifalle
Say what ȝow lust and we wil gladly hiere
And wiþ þat word he said in þis manere
Telleþ quod he ȝour meditacioun
But hasteth ȝow þe sonne wol a doun
Beþ fructuous and þat  in litil space
And to do wel God sende ȝow grace
