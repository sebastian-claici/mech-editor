WHan that Apprille  with his shouris soote
the drought of Marche  hath pershid to the roote
and bathed euery veyne in swich licoure
of which vertue  engendrid is the floure
whan zepherus eke  with his swete brethe
inspirid hath  in euery holt and hethe
the tendre croppis  and the yonge sonne
hath in the Ram  his halff cours Ironne
and smale fowlis make melodie
that slepen al nyght  with open eyghe
so priketh hem nature  in here coragis
that longen folk to gon  on pilgrimagis
and Palmeris for to seke strange strondes
to serue halowes couthe  in sondre londes
and specially  from euery shiris ende
of Ingelond to Caunturbery thei wende
the holy blisfull marter  for to seke
that hem hath holpen  whan thei were seke
bifill that on that seson on a day
in Suthwork atte Tabard as I lay
redy to wende  on my pilgrimage
to Caunterbury  with ful deuout corage
at night was come  into that hosterie
wel xxixti in a companye
of sondry folk  bi auenture Ifalle
in feloshipe  and pilgremes were thei alle
that toward Caunterbury wolde ryde


the chambres and stablis weren wyde
and wel weren eased at the beste
and shortly whan the sonne was to reste
so hadde I spokyn  with hem euerychon
that I was of here feloshipe anon
and made forward erly for to ryse  
to take oure wey  there as I yow devise
but nertheles while I haue tyme and space
or that I ferther in this tale pace
me thynketh it accordant to reson
to telle yow al the condicion
of ech of hem so as it semed me
and which they were and of what degre
and eke in what array that thei were inne
and at a knyght than woll I first bigynne
A knyght ther was and that a worthi man
that fro the tyme  that he first bigan
to riden owt  he loued chyualrie
trouth and honour  fredom and curtesie
ful worthi was he  in his lordis werre
and therto had he riden  no man ferre
as wel in cristendom  as in hethenesse
and euere honoured  for his worthynesse
At Alisandre he was whan it was wonne
ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne
aboven alle nacions in Pruce
in Lectow hadde he reysed and in Ruce
no cristenman  so ofte of his degre
in Garnade at the sege eke hadde he be
of Algezire and riden in Belmarye
at Lyeis was he and at Satalye
whan thei were wonne and in the grete see
at many a noble arme hadde he be
at mortal batailles had he ben ffiftene
and foughten for our feith at Tramessene
in listes thries and ay slayn his foo


this ilke worthi knyght hadde ben also
somtyme with the lord of Palatye
ayeyne another hethen in Turkye
and eueremore he had a souerayne prys
and though that he was worthy he was wys
and of his port as meke as is a mayde  
he neuere yit no vilonye ne saide
in al his liff  vn no manere wight
he was a verry perfit gentill knight
ffor to telle ȝow of his array
His hors were goode but he was not gay
Of fustion he wered a gepon
Al bismotered with his haburgon
ffor he was late ycome from his viage
And wente for to don his pilgrimage
Wiþ him þer was his sone a ȝong squier
A louyere and a lusty bacheler
Wiþ lockes crulle as þei were leyd in presse
Of xx ȝeer of age he was I gesse
Of his statuture  he was of euene lengþe
And wonderly deliuere and gret of strengþe
And he hadde be somtyme in Chiuachie
In fflaundres in artoys and Pykardie
and born him wel as of so litel space
In hope to stonden in his lady grace
Embroyded was he as it were a mede
All ful of freissche floures white and reede
Synging he was or floytynge al þe day
He was als freissch as is þe monþ of may
Schort was his gowne wiþ sleeues longe and wyde
Wel couþe he sitte on an hors and faire ride
He couþe songes make and wel endite
Iuste and eek daunce and wel purteray and write
So hote he loued þat by nighter tale
He sleep nomore þan doþ a nightyngale
Courteys he was lowly and seruisable


and karf biforn his fader atte table
A ȝeman hadde he and seruantes namo
At þat time for him liste ride so
And he was clad in coote and hood of greene
A scheef of pocok arwes bright and keene
Vnder his belt he bar ful þriftily
Wel couþe he dresse his takel ȝimanly
His arwes drouped nought wiþ fetheres lowe
And in his hond he bar a mighty bowe
A nothed hadde he wiþ a broun visage  
Of woodecraft wel couþe he al þe vsage
Vpon his arm he bar a gay bracer
And by his syde a swerd and a bocler
And on þat oþer side a gay daggere
Harnaysed wel and scharp as point of spere
A Christophre on his brest of seluer schene
An horn he bar þe bawdrik was of grene
A foster was he soþly as I gesse
Ther was also a Nonne a Prioresse
That of hir smyling was ful symple a coy
Hir grettest oþ was but by seint loy
And sche was cleped ma dame Englentyne
ffol wel sche song þe seruise diuine
Entuned in hir nose ful semely
And frenssch sche spak ful faire and fetisly
After þe scole of stratford atte Bowe
ffor ffrenssh of Parys was to hire vnknowe
At mete wel Itaught was sche wiþall
Sche leet no morsell from hire lippes falle
Ne wete hire fyngres in hir sauce deepe
Wel couþe sche carie a morsel and wel keepe 
That no drope ne fell vpon hir breste
In Curtesye was sette ful moche hire leste
Hir ouer lippe wyped sche so cleene
That in hir cuppe þer was no ferthing seene
Of grete whan sche dronken hadde hir draughte


fful semely after hir mete sche raughte
And sikerly sche was of gret disporte
And ful plesant and amyable of porte
And peyned hire to counterfete cheere
Of court and to ben estatlich of maneere
And to ben holden digne of reuerence
But for to speken of hir conscience
Sche was so charitable and so pytous
Sche wolde weepe if þat sche sawe a mous
Kaught in a trappe if it were deed or bledde  
Of smale houndes hadde sche þat sche fedde
With rosted fleissh or mylk or wastel brede
But sore wepte sche if oon of hem were dede
Or if men smot it with a ȝerde smerte
And al was conscience and tendre herte
fful semelich hir wympil pynched was
Hir nose was streight hire yghen grey as glas
Hir mouth ful smal and þerto softe and rede
But sikerly sche hadde a fair forhede
It was almost a spanne brood I trowe
ffor hardely sche was nought vndergrowe
fful fetys was hir cloke as I was war
Of smal coral aboute hir arm sche bar
A payre of bedes gauded al with greene
And þeron heng a broche of gold ful scheene
On which þer was first writen with a crowned A
And after Amor vincit omnia
Anoþer Nonne with hir hadde sche 
That was hir Chapelleyne and prestes þre
A Monk þer was a fair for þe maistrie
And out Ridere þat loued venerie
A manly man to ben an abbot able 
fful many a deinte hors hadde he in stable 
And whan he rood men might his brydel heere
Gynglyng in a whistlyng wynd as cleere
And eek as lowde as doþ þe chapel belle


Ther as þis lord was keper of þe selle
The Reule of sent Maure or of seint Beneit
Bycause þat it was old and somdel streit
This ilke monk leet olde þinges pace
And held after þe newe world þe space
He ȝaf nought of þe text a pulled hen
That seith þat hunters be nought holy men
Ne þat a monk whan he is recheles
Is likned til a fyssh þat is waterles
This is to seie a monk out of his cloystre  
But þilke text  held he not worth an oystre 
And I seide his opinion was good
What schulde he studie and make himseluen wood
Vpon a book alwey in cloyste to poure
Or swynke with his hondes and laboure
As austyn bit how schal þe world be serued
Lat austyn haue his swynk to him reserued
Therfore he was a prikasour aright
Grehoundes he hadde swift as foule in flight
Of prikynge and of huntyng for þe hare
Was alle his luste for no cost wolde he spare
I seigh his sleues Ipurfiled at þe hond
Wiþ grys and þat þe fynest of a lond
And for to festne his hood vnder þe chynne
He hadde of gold wrought a ful curious pynne
A loue knotte in þe gretter ende þer was
His hed was balled þat schon as eny glas
And eek his face as he hadde ben anoynt
He was a lord ful fatt and in good poynt
His eyghen stepe and rollyng in his hede
That stemed as a forneys of a lede
His bootes souple his hors in gret estate
Now certeinly he was a fair prelate
He nas nat pale as a forpyned goost
A fat swan loued he best of any rost
His palfray was as broun as is a berie


A ffrere þer was a wanton and a merye
A lymitour a ful solempne man
In all þe ordres foure is non þat can
So mochil of daliance and fair langage
He hadde made ful many a mariage
Of ȝonge wommen at his owne cost
Vnto his ordre he was a noble post
fful wel biloued and famulier was he
Wiþ frankeleyns ouer al in his contre
And wiþ worþi wommen of þe toun  
ffor he hadde power of confessioun
As seyde himself more þan a curat
ffor of his ordre he was licenciat
fful swetly herde he confession
And plesant was his absolucion
He was an esy man to ȝiue penaunce
Ther as he wiste to haue a good pitaunce
ffor vnto a pouer ordre for to ȝiue
Is signe þat a man is wel Ischriue
ffor if he ȝaf he dorste make auant
He wiste þat  a man was repentant
ffor many a man so hard is of his herte
He may nought wepe alþough him sore smerte
Therfore in stede of weepyng and preyeres
Men mote ȝeue siluer to þe pouere freeres
His typet was ay farsed ful of knyfes
And pynnes for to ȝiue faire wyues
And certeynly he hadde a mery note 
Wel couþe he synge and playen on a rote
Of ȝeddynges he bar witterly þe pris
His nekke whit  was as þe flourdelys
Therto he was strong as a Champioun
He knew þe tauernes wel in euery toun
And euerich hostiller and tapstere
Bet þan a lazar or a Beggere
ffor vnto such a worþi man as he


Acorded nought as by his faculte
To haue with such sek lazer aqueintance
It is nought honest it may nought auaunce
ffor to delen with such poraile
But all with Riche and sellere of vitaille
And ouer al þer as profyt scholde arise
Curtays he was and lowly of seruise
Ther nas no man nowher so vertuous
He was þe beste begger in his hous
    
ffor þough a widewe hadde nought a scho  
So plesant was his In principio
Ȝet wolde he haue a ferþing or he wente
His purchas was wel bettre þan his rente
And rage he couþe right as it were a whelpe 
In louedayes þer couþe he moche helpe 
ffor þer he was not lich a cloysterer
With a thredbare cope as a pore scoler
But he was lik a maister or a pope
Of double worstede was his semycope 
That rounded as a belle on the presse
Somwhat he lipsed for his wantounesse
To make his englissh sweete vpon his tonge
And in his harpyng whan þat he hadde songe 
His yghen twyncled in his heed aright
As don þe sterres in þe frosty night
This worþi lymitour was cleped huberd
A marchant was þer with a forked berd
In mottle and heigh on horse he satte
Vpon his heued a fflaundrissh beuer hatte
His bootes clapsed faire and fetysly
His resons he spak ful solempnely
Schewyng alwey þe encres of his wynnynge
He wolde þe see were kept for eny þinge
Bytwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle


Wel couþe he in eschaunge scheldes selle 
This worþy man ful wel his witte bisette
Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette
So statly was he of his gouernance
With his bargaynes and his cheuissance
ffor soþe he was a worþi man withall
But soþly to sein I not how men him call
A Clerk þer was of Oxenford also
That vnto logyk hadde long Igo
As lene was his hors as is a rake
And he nas not right fat I vndertake
But loked holwe and þerto soburly  
fful þredbare was his ouereste courtepy
ffor he had geten him no benifice
Ne was so worldly for to haue office
ffor him was leuer to haue at his bed hede
Twenty bookes clad in blak and rede
Of Aristotle and his philosophie
Than robes riche or fithel or gay Sautrie 
But al by þat he was a philosophre
Ȝit had he but a litel gold in cofre
But al þat he might of his frendes hente 
On bokes and on lernyng he it  spente
And besily gan for þe soules preye
Of hem þat ȝaf him wherwith to scoleye
Of studie took he most cure and most heede
Nought o word spak he more þan was neede
And þat was seyd in forme and reuerence
And schort and quyk and ful of heigh sentence
Sownyng in moral vertu was his speche
And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche
A Sergeant of þe lawe war and wys
That often hadde ben at þe Parvys
That was also  ful riche of excellence
Discret he was and of gret reuerence
He semed swich his wordes were so wise


Iustice he was ful often in assise
By patent and by plein commission
ffor his science and for his heigh renoun
Of fees and robes had he many oon
So gret a purchaceour was nowher non
Al was fee simple to him in effecte
His purchasynge might not ben infecte
No wher so besy a man as he þer nas
And ȝit he semed bisiere þan he was
In termes hadde he caas and doomes alle
That from þe tyme of king William were falle
Therto he couþe endite and make a þink  
Ther couþe no wight pynche at his writynk
And euery statut couþe he plein by Rote
He rood but homly in a medly coote
Gert with a seint of silk  wiþ barres smale 
Of his array telle I no lenger tale
A ffrankeleyn was in his compaignie
Whit was his berd as is the dayessye
Of his complexion he was sanguyne
Wel loued he by þe morwe a sop in wyne
To lyuen in delit euer was his wone 
ffor he was Opiournes owne sone
That held opinion þat plein delite
Was verrey felicite parfite
An houshalder and þat a gret was he
Seint Iulian he was in his contre
His breed his ale was alweys after oon
A better envyned man was neuer noon
Wiþoute bake mete was neuer his hous
Of fissh and fleissh and þat so plenteuous
It snewed in his hous of mete and drink
Of alle deyntes þat men coude þink
After þe sondry sesons of þe ȝere
So changed he his mete and his sopeere
fful many a fat partrich hadde he in Mewe


And many a brem and many a luce in stuwe
Wo was his cooke but his sauce were
Poynant and scharp and redy all his gere
His table dormant  in his halle alway
Stod redy couered all the longe day
At Sessions þer was he lord and sire
fful ofte tyme he was knight of þe schire
An anelas and a gisper al of silke
Heng at his girdel whit as morne mylke
A scherref had he ben and a comptour
Was nowher such a worþi vauasour
An haburdaissher and a Carpenter  
A Webbe a Dyer and a Tapecer
And þei were cloþed alle in oo liuere
Of a solempne and a gret ffraternite
fful freissch and newe here gere apiked was
Here knyfes nere chaped nought wiþ bras
But all wiþ siluer wrought ful clene and wel
Here gerdles and here pouches eueridel
Wel semed ech of hem a fair burgeys
To sitten in a yeldehalle on a deys
Euerich for þe wisdom þat he can
Was schaply for to ben an Alderman
ffor Catell hadde þei ynough and rente
And eek here wyues wolde it wel assente
And elles certein þei were to blame
It is ful fair to be cleped ma dame
And gon to vigilies al bifore
And haue a mantel rialliche  bore
A Cook þei hadde wiþ hem for þe nones
To boyle þe chikenes with þe maryebones
And poudre marchānt tart and gallyngale
Wel kowde he know a draught of london ale 
He couþe rost and seþe and broile and frie
Maken mortreux and wel bake a pye
But gret harm was it as it þoughte me


That on his schyne a mormal hadde he
ffor blankmanger þat made he wiþ þe beste 
A schipman was þer wonyng fer by weste
ffor ought I wot he was of Dertemouthe
He rood vpon a rouncy as he couþe
In a gowne of faldyng to þe knee 
A dagger hangyng in a lace hadde he 
Aboute his nekke vnder his arm adoun
The hoote somer had mad his hiew al broun
And certeinly he was a good felawe
fful many a draught of wyn he hadde drawe
ffrom Burdeaux warde whil þe chapmen sleepe  
Of nyce conscience took he no keepe
If þat he faught and had þe heigher honde
By water he sent hem hom to euery londe
But of his craft to riken wel his tydes
His stremes and his daunger him besydes
His herberwe and his moone and his ledmannage
Ther was non such from hulle to kartage
Hardy he was and wys to vndurtake
With many a tempest had his berd be schake
He knew alle þe hauenes as they were
ffro Gotlond to þe Cape de fynystere
And euery Cryke in Bretaigne and in Spaigne
His barge ycleped was þe Mawdeleyne
With vs þer was a Doctour of Phisike
In al þis world ne was þer non him like
To speke of Phisik and of Surgerie
ffor he was grounded in astronomie
He kept his pacient a ful gret del
In houres by his magique naturel
Wel couþe he fortune the ascendent
Of his ymages for his pacient
He knewe þe cause of euery maladie 
Were it of hoot of cold or moist or drie 
And wher engendred and of what humour


He was a verray parfit practisour
The cause Iknowe and of his harm þe rote 
Anon he ȝaf þe sike man his bote
fful redy had he his appotecaries
To sende hem drugges and his letuaries
ffor ech of hem made oþer for to wynne
Here frendschip nas nat  newe for to gynne 
Wel knew he þe olde Escalapius
And discorides and eke Rusus
Olde ypocras haly and Galien
Serapion Razie and auyzen
Auerois damascien and Constantine  
Bernard and Gatisdene and Gilbertine
Of his diete mesurable was he
ffor it was of no superfluite
But of gret norisshing and digestible
His studie was but litel on the bible
In sangweyn and in pers he clad was al
Lyned wiþ Taffata and with Sendal
And yet he was but esy of dispense
He kepte þat he wan in Pestilence
ffor gold in phisique is accordial
Therfore he loued gold in special
A good wif þer was of bysyde bathe
But sche was somdel def and þat was skaþe
Of cloþmakyng sche hadde such an haunte
Sche passed hem of ypres and of Gaunte
In al þe parissche wif ne was þer noon
Þat to þe offryng toforn hire schulde gon
And if þer dede certein wroþ was sche
That sche was oute of alle charite 
Hire couerchiefs ful fyne were of grounde
I dorste swere þei weyeden ten pounde 
That on a soneday weren vpon hir hede
Hire hosen weren of fyn scarlet reede
fful streyt yteyed and schoos ful moyste and newe


Bolde was hir face and fair and reed of hewe
Sche was a worþi womman al hir lyue
Housbondes atte chirche dore sche hadde fyue
Wiþouten oþer companye in ȝouþe
But þerof needeþ nought to speke as nouþe
And þries hadde sche ben at Ierusalem
Sche hadde passed many a strange strem
At Rome sche hadde ben and at Boloigne
In Galice at saint Iame and at Coloigne
Sche couþe moche of wandring by þe weye
Gat toþed was sche soþly for to seye
Vpon an ambler esely sche satte  
Iwympled wel and on hir heed an hatte
As brood as is a bokeler or a targe
A fotemantell abouten hir hipes large 
And on hire feet a paire of spores scharpe
In felaschipe wel couþe sche laughe and carpe
Of remedies of loue sche knew par chaunce 
ffor sche couþe of þat art þe colde daunce
A good man was þer of religioun
And was a poure person of a toun
But riche he was of holy þought and werk
He was also a lerned man and a clerk
That cristes gospell trewly wolde preche
His parisshiens deuoutly wolde he teche
Benigne he was and wonder diligent
And in aduersite ful pacient
and swich he was preued ofte siþes
fful loþ were him to cursen for his tyþes 
But raþer wolde he yeuen out of doute
Vnto his poure parisshens aboute
Of his offryng and of his substance
He couþe in litel þing haue suffisance
Wyd was his parisshe and houses fer asondre
But he ne lefte nought for rayn ne þondre
In seknesse nor in meschief to visite


The ferreste in his parisshe moche and lite
Vpon his feet and in his hond a staf
This noble ensample to his scheep he yaf
That ferst he wrought and aftirward he taughte
Out of þe gospel he þo wordes caughte
And þis fugure he addede eek  þerto
That if gold ruste what schal Iren do
ffor if a prest be foul on whom we truste
No wonder is a lewed man to Ruste
And schame it is if a prest take kepe
A schiten schepperde and a clene schepe
Wel ought a prest ensample for to ȝyue  
By his clennes how þat his scheep schulde lyue
He sette nought his benefice to hire
And leet his scheep acombred in þe myre
And ran to london vnto Seinte Poules
To seeke him a Chaunterie for soules
Or with a breþerede for to be withholde 
But duelte at hom and kepte wel his folde
So þat þe wolf ne made it not miscarie
He was a schepperde and not a mercenarie
And þough he holy were and vertuous
He was nought to synful men dispitous
Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne
But in his teching discret and benigne
To drawe folk to heuen by fairnesse
By good ensample þis was his bisynesse 
But it were ony persone obstinat
What so he were of heigh or low estat
Him wolde he snebbe scharply for þe nones
A bettre prest I trowe þat nowher non es
He waited after no pompe and reuerence
Ne maked him a spiced conscience
But cristes lore and his apostles twelue
He taught but ferst he folwed in himselue 
With him þer was a plowman was his broþer


That hadde Iladde of dong ful many a foþer
A trewe swynker and a good was he
Lyuyng in pees and parfit charite
God loued he best wiþ alle his herte
At alle tymes þough him gamed or smerte
And þan his Neighebore right as him selue
He wolde þressche and þerto dike and delue
ffor cristes sake for euery pouere wight
Wiþouten hire if it lay in his might
His tiþes payed he ful fair and well
Boþe of his propre swynk and his catell
In a Tabbard he rood vpon a mere  
Ther was also a Reeue and a Mellere 
A Sompnour and a Pardoner also
A Maunciple and my self þer nare no mo 
The meller was a stout carl for þe nones
fful big he was of brawn and eek of bones
That proued wel for ouer al þar he cam
Atte wrastlyng he wold haue awey þe ram
He was schort schuldred a þikke knarre
The was no dore þat he nolde heue of harre
Or breke it at a rennyng with his heede
His berd as eny sowe or eny fox was reede
And þerto brod as þough it were a spade 
Vpon þe cop right of his nose he hade
A wert and þeron stood a tuft of heeres
Reed as the berstles of a sowes Eres 
Hise noseþrilles blake weren and wide
A swerd and bokeler bar he by his syde
His mouþ as gret was as a gret fourneys
He was a Iangler and a goliardeys
And þat was most of synne and harlotries
Wel couþe he stele corn and tolle þries
And ȝit he hadde a þombe of gold parde
A whit cote and a blew hood wered he
A Baggepipe wel couþe he blowe and soun


And þerwithal he brought vs out of toun
A gentil maunciple was þer of a temple 
Of which achatours mighte take exsemple 
ffor to ben wyse in byeng of vitaile
ffor wheþer þat he paied or took by taile
Algate he wayted so in his achate
That he was ay biforn and in good estate 
Now is not þat of god a ful fair grace
That such a lewed mannes witt schal pace
The wisdom of an heep of lernede men
Of maistres hadde mo þan þries ten
That were of lawe expert and curious  
Of which þer was a dosein in that hous
Worþi to ben Stywardes of Rente and londe
Of any lord þat is in Ingelonde
To make him lyue by his propre good
In honour detteles but if þat he were wood
Or lyue as skarsly as him list desire
And able for to helpen al a schire
In any cas þat mighte falle or happe
And ȝit þis manciple sette here alþer cappe
The Reeue was a sclender colerik man
His berd was schaue as nygh as euer he can
His her was by his eeres ful round yschorn
His toppe was dokked lik a prest biforn
fful longe were his legges and ful lene
Ilik a staf þer was no calf ysene
Wel couþe he kepe a garner or a bynne
Ther was non auditour couþe on him wynne
Wel wist he by þe drought and by þe reyne
The yeldyng of his seed and of his greyne
His lordes scheep his neet his dayerie
His swyn his hors his stoor and his pulletrie
Was holly in þis Reeues gouernynge 
And by his couenant ȝaf þe rikenynge
Syn þat his lord was twenty ȝeer of age


Ther couþe no man brynge him in arrerage
Ther nas baillif ne herde nor oþer hyne
That he ne knew his sleight and his covyne
They were adrad of him as of þe deþ
His wonyng was ful fair vpon an heþ
Wiþ greene trees schadewed was his place
He couþe bettre þan his lord purchace
fful Riche he was astored priuely
His lord he couþe plese wel subtily
To yiue and lene him of his oughne good
And haue a þank and yet a cote and hood
In ȝouþe he hadde lerned a good mester  
He was a wel good wrighte a Carpenter
This reeue satte vpon a ful good stot
That was al pomely grey and highte scot
A long Surcote of pers vpon he hadde
And by his syde he bar a rusty bladde
Of Northfolk was þis Reue of which I telle
Bysyden a toun men clepen it Baldeswelle
Tukked he was as is a frere aboute
And euer he rood þe hyndrest of oure route
A Somynour was þer with vs in þat place
That hadde a fyri cherubynnes face
ffor Sauseflem he was with eyghen narwe 
Als hoot he was and leccherous as a sparwe
Wiþ scalled browes blak and piled berde 
Of his visage children weren afferde
Ther nas quyk siluer litarge or bremston
Boras orsure ne oyle of Tarte noon
Ne oynement þat wolde clense and byte
To him might helpe of his whelkes white
Nor of þe knobbes sittyng in his cheekes
Wel loued he garlik oynons and eek leekes
And for to drinke strong wyn reed as blood
Than wolde he speke and crye as he were wood
And whan þat he wel dronken hadde þe wyn


Than wold he speke no word but latyne
A fewe termes hadde he tuo or þre
That he had lerned out of som decre
No wonder is he herd it al þe day
And eek ȝe knowen it wel how þat a Iay
Can clepe watte as wel as can þe pope
But who so couþe in oþer þing him grope
Than hadde he spent al his philosophie
Ay questio quid Iuris wolde he crye
He was a gentil harlot and a kynde
A bettre felaw schulde men not fynde
He wolde suffre for a quart of wyn  
A good felawe to haue his concubyn
A twelf moneth and excuse him atte fulle 
fful priuely eek a fynch couþe he pulle 
And if he fond owher a good felawe
He wolde techen him to han non awe
In such caas of þe Erchedeknes curs
But if mannes soule were in his purs
ffor in his purs he scholde punyssched be
Purs is þe Erchedeknes helle seide he
But wel I wot he lyhede right in dede
Of cursyng ought eche gilty man him drede
ffor curs wil sle right as assoylyng sauith
And also war him of a Significauith
In daunger hadde he at his owne gyse
The yonge gerles of þe diocise
And knew here counseil and what was al here rede
A garland hadde he sette vpon his heede
As gret as it were for an ale stake
A bokeler hadde he made him of a cake 
With him þer rood a gentill pardoner
Of Rouncyuall his frend and his comper
That streight was comen fro þe court of Rome
fful lowe he song come hider loue tome
This Somnour bar to him a stif burdoun


Was neuer trompe of half so gret a soun
This pardoner hadde her as yelow as wax
But smothe it heng as doth a strik of flax
By ounces heng his lokkes þat he hadde 
And þer with he his schuldres ouer spradde
But þinne it lay by culpons on and oon
But hood for Iolite werede he noon
ffor it was trussed vp in his walet
Him þoughte he rood al of the newe get
Discheuele saf his cappe he rood al bare
Swich glaryng yghen hadde he as an hare
A vernicle hadde he sewid on his cappe  
His walet  biforn him in his lappe 
Bret ful of pardon comen fro Rome al hoot
A voys he hadde as smal as a goot
No berd ne hadde he ne neuer schulde haue
As smothe it was as it ware late schaue
I trowe he were a geldyng or a mare
But of his craft fro Berwik in to ware
Ne was þer such anoþer pardoner
ffor in his male he hadde a pilewber
Which þat he sayde was oure lady veyle
He seide he hadde a gobet of þe seyle
That seint petir hadde whan þat he wente
Vpon the see til ihesu crist him hente
He hadde a Croys of laton ful of stones
And in a glas he hadde pigges boones
But with þese reliqes whan þat he fonde
A poure person dwellyng vpon londe 
Vpon a day he gat him more moneye
Than þat þe person gat in monþes tweye
And þus with feyned flatering and Iapes
He made þe person and þe poeple his apes
But trewely to tellen atte þe laste
He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste
Wel couþe he rede a lessonn or a story


But alþer best he song an offertory
ffor wel he wiste whan þat song was songe
He moste preche and wel affile his tonge
To wynne seluer as he  wel cowde
Ther fore he song so meriely and lowde 
Now haue I told ȝow soþly in a clause
The estat  the array þe nombre and eeke þe cause
Whi þat assembled was þis companie
In Suthwerk at þis gentil hostelrie 
That highte þe Tabbard faste by þe belle
But now is tyme to yow for to telle 
How þat we beeren vs þat ilke night  
Whan we were in þat Osterie alight
And after wol I telle of oure viage
And all the remenant of our pilgrimage
But ferst I pray ȝow of your curtesie
The ȝe ne rette it nought my vilenye
Though þat I pleinly speke in þis matere
To telle ȝow here wordes and here cheere
Ne þough I speke here wordes propurly
ffor þis ȝe knowen as wel as I
Who so schal telle a tale after a man
He mot reherse as neyh as euer he can
Euerich a word if it be in his charge
Al speke he neuer so rudely and large
Or elles he moot telle his tale vntrewe
Or feyne þinges or fynde wordes newe
He may nought spare al þough he were his broþer
He moot als wel seie o word as anoþer
Crist spak himself ful brode in holy writte
And wel ȝe wot no vilenye is itte
Ek Plato seith who so can him rede
The wordes mot be cosyn to þe dede
Also I preyȝe ȝow forȝiue it me
Al haue I not set folk in here degre
Heer in þis tale as þat þei scholden stonde


My witt is schort ȝe may wel vnderstonde
Gret cheere maad oure ost vs euerychon
And to þe souper sette he vs anon
He serued vs with vitailles atte beste
Strong was þe wyn and wel drynken vs leste
A semly man our hoste he was with alle
ffor to ben a marchall in an halle
A large man he was with eyȝen stepe
A fairer burgeys is þer non in Chepe
Bold of his speche and wys and wel ytaught
And of manhode him lakkede right naught
Ek þer to he was right a merie man  
And after soper pleyen he bigan
And spak of merþe amonges oþer þinges
Whan þat he hadde maad our rikenynges
And seide þus Now lordynges trewely
Ȝe ben to me welcome right hertely
ffor by my trouthe if þat I schal not lye
I seyh not þis yer so mery a companye
At oones in þis herberw as is now
ffayn wold I don ȝou merthe wist I how
And of a merþe I am right now biþought
To don you eese and it schal coste nought
ye gon to Caunturbury god yow speede
The blisful martir quyte ȝou ȝour meede
And wel I woot as ȝe gon by þe weye
ye schapen ȝou to talen and to pleye
ffor trewely confort ne merþe is non
To riden by þe wey domb as a ston
And þer for wol I make you disport
As I seide erst and do you som confort
And if ȝou likeþ all by on assent
ffor to stonden at my Iuggement
And for to werken as I schal ȝou seie
To morwe whan ȝe riden by þe weie 
Now by my fader soule þat is deed


But ȝe be merye I wil ȝeue ȝow myn heed
Hold vp ȝour hond wiþoute more speche 
Our counseil was not longe for to seche 
vs þought it was not worþ to make it wys
And graunted him wiþoute more avys
And bad him seye his verdit as him leste
Lordynges quod he  now herkneþ for þe beste
But take it nought I prey ȝow in disdeigne
This is þe poynt to speke schort and pleigne
That ech of ȝou to schorte with ȝour weye
In þis viage schal telle tales tweie
To Caunturburyward I mene it so  
And homward he schal tellen oþer tuo
Of auentures þat whilom haue bifall
And which of yow þat beriþ him best of all
That is to sein that telleþ in þis cas
Tales of best sentence and most solas 
Schal haue a souper at our alþer cost
Her in þis place sittynge by þis post
Whan þat we comen aȝein fro Canturbury
And for to make ȝou þe more mury
I wil my seluen goodly with ȝou ryde
Right at myn owne cost and be ȝour gyde
And who so wol my Iuggement wiþ seye
Schal paye al þat we spende by þe weye
And if ȝe vouche saf þat it be so
Tel me anon wiþouten wordes moo
And I wol erly schape me þer fore
This þing was graunted and our oþes swore
With ful glad herte and preyȝen him also
That he wolde vouche saf for to do so
And þat he wolde ben our gouernour
And of oure tales Iugge and reportour
And sette a souper at a certein pris
And we wiln rewled ben at his deuys 
In heighe and lowe and þus by oon assent


We ben accorded to þe Iuggement
And þer vpon þe wyn was fet anon
We dronken and to reste went echon
Wiþouten eny lenger taryyng
A morwe whan þe day bigan to spryng
vp ros oure oost and was our alþer cok
And gadered vs to gider all in a flok
And forþ we riden a litel more þan paas
vnto þe wateryng of seint Thomas
And þer our oost gan his hors areste
And seide lordes herkneþ if you leste 
Ȝe wot ȝour forward and I it ȝou recorde  
If euynsong and morwesong acorde
lat see now who schal telle þe firste tale
As euer mote I drynke wyn of ale
Who so be rebel to my Iuggement 
Schal paie for all that by þe weie is spent
Now draweþ Cut or þat we ferþer twynne
he which þat haþ þe schortest schal bigynne
 Sir knight quod he my maister and my lord
Now draweþ Cut for þat is myn acord
Comeþ nerre quod he my lady prioresse
And ȝe sir clerk let be ȝour schamfastnesse
Ne studieþ nought lay hond to euery man
Anon to drawe euery wight bygan
And schortly for to tellen as it was 
Were it by auenture or sort or cas
The soþ is þis the Cut fel to þe knight
Of which ful bliþe and glad was euery wight
And telle he moste his tale as it was resoun
By forward and by composicioun
As ȝe han herd what nedeþ wordes mo
And whan þis good man saugh þat it was so
As he þat wys was and obedient
To keepe his forward by his free assent
He seide siþþe I schal begynne þe game


What welcome be þe Cutte a goddes name
Now lat vs ride and herkneþ what I seye
And with þat word we riden forþ oure weye
And he bigan with right a merye cheere
His tale anon and seyde as ȝe may heere

Whilom was as olde stories tellen vs
Ther was a Duk that highte Theseus 
Of Athenes he was  lord and gouernour
And in his tyme such a Conquerour
That grettere was non vnder þe sonne  
fful many a riche Contre hadde he wonne
What with his wisdam and his chiuallerie
He conquered all þe regne of ffeminie
That whilom was Icleped Scithia
And weddede þe queen ypolita
And brought hir hom wiþ him in his contre
With muche glorie and gret solempnite
And eek hir ȝonge suster Emelye
And þus with victorie and with melodie
Late I þis noble duk to Athenes ride
And all his host in armes him bisyde
And certes if it nere to long to heere
I wolde haue tolde fully þe manere
how wonnen was þe regne of ffeminie
By Theseus and by his Chiualrie
And of the grete bataille for þe noones
Bitwixen athenes and Amazones
And how asseged was Ipolita
The faire hardy quene of Scithia
And of þe fest þat was at hir weddyng
And of þe tempest at hir hom comyng
But al þat þing I moot as now forbere 
I haue god wot a large feeld to ere
And weyke ben þe oxen in my plough
The remnant of þe tale is long ynough
I wol not letten eek noon of þis route


Lat euery felawe telle his tale aboute
And lat se now who schal þe souper wynne
And þer I lafte I wil aȝein bigynne
This Duk of whom I make mencioun
Whan he was comen almost to þe toun
In all his wele and his moste pryde
He was war as he cast his eyhe asyde
Wher þat þer kneled in þe heighe weye
A company of ladies tweye and tweye  
Eche after oþer cladde in cloþes blake
But such a cry and such a woo þei make
That in þis world is creature lyuynge
That herde such anoþer weymentynge
And of þis cry þey nolde neuer stente
Til þei þe Reynes of his bridel hente
What folk ben ȝe þat at myn hom comynge
Pertourbe so my feste wiþ cryinge
Quod Theseus haue ȝe so gret enuye
Of myn honour that þus compleigne and crie
Or who haþ ȝou mysboden or offended
And telleþ me if it may ben amended
And whi þat ȝe ben cloþed thus in blak
The eldest lady of hem alle spak
Whan sche had swouned with a dedly cheere
That it was routhe for to seen and heere
 Sche seide lord to whom fortune haþ yiuen
Victorie and as a conquerour to lyuen
Not greueþ ous ȝoure gloire and your honour
But we beseke mercy and socour
Haue mercy on our woo and our distresse
Som drope of pite þurgh þi gentilesse 
vpon vs wrecched wommen let ȝe fall
ffor certes lord þer is non of vs all
That sche nath ben a duchesse or a queene
Now be we Caytifs as it is wel seene
Thanked be fortune and hir false whiel


That non estat ensureth for to ben wel
Now certes lord to abyde ȝoure presence 
Here in þis temple of the goddesse Clemence
We haue be waytinge al þis fourte night
Helpe vs lord siþ it is in þy might
 I wrecche which þat weepe and weile þus
Was whilom wyf of king Cappaneus
That starf at Thebes cursed be þat day
And alle we þat ben in þis array  
And maken al þis lamentacioun
We losten all our housbondes at þat toun
Whil þat þassege þer aboute lay
And yet now þe olde Creon weiloway
That lord is now of Thebes þe Cite
ffulfild of Ire and of Iniquite
He for despite and for his Tyrannie
To don þe deede bodies vilenye
Of all oure lordes whiche þat ben slawe
Haþ all þe bodies on an heep ydrawe
And wol nought suffre hem by non assent
Neither to ben yburied noþer ybrent
But makeþ houndes ete hem in despyt
And with þat word wiþoute more respit
Thei fellen gruf and cryden pitously
Haue on vs wrecchede wommen som mercy
And lat our sorwe synken in þin herte
This gentil duk doun from his courser sterte
With herte pitous whan he herde hem speke
Him þoughte þat his herte wolde breke
Whan he saugh hem so pite and so mate
That whilom were of so gret astate
And in his armes he hem all vp hente
And hem conforteþ in ful good entente
And swor his oth as he was trewe knight
He wolde don so ferforþly his might
Vpon þe tyrant hem to wreke


That all þe poeple of grece scholde speke
How Creon was of Theseus yserued
As he þat hadde his deþ ful wel deserued
And right anon wiþouten more abod
His baner he displaied and forth rood
To Thebesward and al his host biside
No nerre Athenes wolde he go ne ride
Ne take his ease fully half a day
But onward on his way þat night he lay  
And sente anon ypolita þe queene
And Emelye hir ȝonge suster scheene
Vnto þe toun of Athenes to dwelle
And forþ he ritte þer nys namore to telle
The rede Statue of Mars with spere and targe
So schineþ in his white baner large
That alle þe feelde gliteren vp and doun
And by his baner born is his pynoun
Of gold ful riche in which þer was ybete
The Mynataur which þat he wan in Grece
Thus rit þis duk þus rit þis conquerour
And in his host of Chiuallerie þe flour
Til þat he come to Thebes and alight
ffaire in þe feeld þer as he þought to fight
But schortly for to speken of þis þing
With Creon which þat was of Thebes king
He faught and slough him manly as a knight
In pleyn bataile and putte þe folk to flight
And by asseut he wan þe Cite after
And rente adoun boþe wall and sparre and rafter
And to þe ladies he restored ageyn
The bones of here frendes þat were slayn
To don obsequies as was þo þe gyse
But it were all to longe to deuyse
The grete clamour and þe waymentyng
That the ladys made atte brennyng
Of þe bodies and þe gret honour


That Theseus þe noble conquerour
Doþ to þe bodies whan þei from him wente
But schortly for to telle is myn entente
Whan þat þis worþi duk þis theseus
Haþ Creon slayn and wonne Thebes þus
Stille in þat feeld he took al night his reste
And dide with all þe contre as him leste
To ransake in þe caas of þe bodies deede
Hem for to streepe of harneys and of wede  
The pilours diden bysynesse and cure
After þe bataile and disconfiture
And so bifelle þat in the caas þei founde
Thurgh girt with many a greuous blody wounde
Tuo ȝonge knightes liggynge by and by
Boþe in armes same wrought ful richely
Of which tuo Arcita hight þat oon
And þat oþer knight highte Palamon
Nat fully quyk ne fully deed þei were
But by her cote armours and by here gere
The heraudes knewe hem self in special
As þei þat weren of þe blood real
Of Thebes and of sustren tuo yborn
Out of þe caas þe pilours han hem torn
And han hem caried softe vnto þe tente
Of Theseus and he ful sone hem sente 
To Athenes to dwellen in prisoun
perpetuelly hem nolde he not Raunson
And whan þis worþi duk haþ þus ydon
He took his oost and home he rit anon
With laurer corouned as a conquerour
And þere he lyueþ in ioye and in honour
Terme of his lif what needeþ wordes mo
And in a tour in angwissh and in woo
Dwellen þis Palamon and eek Arcite
ffor euere more þer may no gold hem quite
This passeþ ȝeer by yer and day by day


Til it fel oones in a morwe of May
That Emely þat fairer was to seene
Than is þe lilye vpon his stalke grene
And freisscher þan þe may wiþ floures newe
ffor wiþ þe rose colour strof hir hewe 
I not which was þe fairer of hem tuo
Er it were day as was hire wone to do
Sche was arisen and al redy dight
ffor May wil haue no sluggardie on night  
The seson prikeþ euery gentil herte 
And makeþ it out of his sleep to sterte
And siþen arise and don may obseruance
This makeþ Emelye to haue remembrance
To don honour to May and for to rise
Icloþed was sche freissh for to deuyse
Hir yelow her was broyded in a tresse
Byhinde hir bak a yerde long I gesse
And in þe gardyn atte sonne vpriste
Sche walkeþ vp and doun and as hir liste
Sche gadreth floures party whit  and reede 
To make a sotyl garland for hir heede
And as an angel heuenysshely sche song
The grete tour þat was so þikke and strong
Which of þe Castell was þe chief dongeon
Ther as þe knightes weren in prison
Of which I tolde ȝou and telle schal
Was euen ioynant to þe gardein wal
Ther as þis Emely had hir pleying
Bright was þe sonne and cler in þat mornyng
And Palamon þis woful prisoner
As was his wone by leue of his gailler
Was risen and romed in a chambre on heigh
In which he al þe noble cite seigh
And ek þe gardyn ful of branches grene
Ther as þe freisshe Emely þe schene
Was in hir walk and romed vp and doun


This sorwful prisoner this Palamoun
Goþ in þe chambre Romynge to and fro
And to himself compleignyng of his wo
That he was born ful ofte seide allas
And so byfell by auenture or caas
That þorugh a wyndow þikke of many a barre
Of yren gret and square as any sparre
He cast his eyghen vpon Emelya
And þer with al he bleynt and cryed a  
As þough he stongen were vnto þe herte
And with þat crye Arcite anon vp sterte 
And seide Cosyn myn what eyleþ þe
That art so pale and dedly on to se
Why crydestow who haþ þe don offence
ffor goddes loue tak al in pacience
Oure prisoun for it may non oþer be
ffortune haþ yiue vs þis aduersite
Som wicke aspect or disposicion
Of Saturne by som constollacion
Haþ ȝiuen vs þis al þough we had it sworn
So stood þe heuen whan þat we ware born
We mote endure it þis is schort and playn
This Palamon answerd and seide again 
Cosyn for soþe of þis opynion
Þou hast a vain Imaginacion
This prison causede me nought to crie
But I was hurt right now þorugh out myn yhe
In to myn hert þat wol my bane be
The fayrnesse of þat lady þat I see
Ȝonde in the gardyn rome to and fro
Is cause of al my crying and my wo
I not wher sche be womman or goddesse
But Venus is it soþly as I gesse
And þer with al on knees a doun he fille
And seyde Venus if it be þy wille
yow in þis gardeyn þus to transfigure


Byfore me sorwful wrecched creature
Out of þis prison help þat we mowe scape
And if so be oure destenye be schape
By eterne world to deyen in prison
Of oure lynage haue som compassion
That is so lowe ybrought by tyrannie
And with þat word Arcite gan aspye
Wher as þis lady romed to and fro
And with þat sight hir beaute hurt him so  
That if þat Palamon was wounded sore
Arcite is hurt as muche as he or more 
And with a syke he seyde pitously
The freissche beaute sleþ me sodeinly
Of hire þat rometh in þe yonder place
And but I haue hir mercy and hir grace
That I may seen hir atte leste wey
I nam but ded þer nys no more to sey
This Palamon whan he þis wordes herde
Dispitously he loked and answerde
Wheþer seistow þis in ernest or in pleye
Nay quod Arcite in ernest by my feye
God helpe me so me lust ful yuel playe
This Palamon gar kne his browes twaye
It were to þe quod he no gret honour
ffor to be fals ne for to be traytour
To me þat am þi cosyn and þi broþer
ysworn ful deepe and ech of vs til oþer
That neuer for to deyen in þe payn
Til þat þe deþ departe schal vs twayn
Neither in loue for to hinder oþer
Ne in non oþer cas my lieue broþer
But þat þou scholdest trewly forþer more
In euery caas and I schal forþre þe þore
This was þin oþ and myn also certeine
I wot right wel þou darst it not wiþseyne
Thus art þou of my counseil out of doute


And now þou woldest falsly ben aboute
To loue my lady whom I loue and serue
And euer schal til þat myn herte sterue
Now certes fals Arcite þou schalt not so
I loued hir ferst and tolde þe my wo
As to my counseil and my broþer sworn
To forthre me as I haue told biforn
ffor which þou art ybounden as a knight
To helpe me if it lay in thy might  
Or elles art þou fals I dar wel sayn
This Arcite ful proudly spak agayn
Thou schalt quod he be raþer fals þan I
But þou art fals I telle þe witterly
 ffor paramour I loued hir first er þou
What wilt þou seyn þou wist it nought yit now
Wheþur sche be a womman or goddesse
Thin is affeccion of holynesse
And myn is loue as to a creature
ffor which I tolde þe myn auenture
As to my cosyn and to my broþer sworn
I pose þat þou louedest hire biforn
Wostow nought wel þe olde clerkes sawe
That who schal ȝiue a louer eny lawe
loue is a gretter lawe by my pan
Than may be yeue to eny erthly man
And þerfore positif lawe and such decree
Is broke alday for loue in eche degree
A man moot needes loue maugre his hede
He may not fleen hit þough he scholde be dede
Al be sche mayde or wydow or elles wif
And eek it is not likly al þi lif
To stonden in hir grace namore schal I
ffor wel þou wost þi selue verreily
That þou and I ben dampned to prison
Perpetuelly vs gaigneth no Ramson
We stryuen now as houndes for þe bon


They fought alday and ȝet here part was non
Ther com a kyte whil þat þei were so wroþe
That bar a way þe bon bytwixe hem boþe
Ak þerfore atte kinges court my broþer
Ech man for him self þer is non oþer
Loue if þou list for I loue and ay schal
A soothly leue broþer þis is al
Her in þis prison mote we endure
And euerich of vs take his auenture  
Gret was þe strif and long bitwix hem tweye
If þat I hadde leyser for to seie 
But to þis effect it happed on a day
To telle it ȝou as schortly as I may
A worþi duk þat highte Perotheus
That felawe was vnto duk Theseus
Syn þilke day þat þai were children lite
Was come to Athenes his felawe to visite
and for to pleye as he was wont to do
ffor in þis world he loued noman so
And he loued him als tendurly agayn
So wel þei loued as olde bokes sayn
That whan þat oon was ded soþly to telle 
his felaw went and sought him doun in helle
But of þat story list me nought to write
Duk Perotheus louede wel arcite
And had him knowe at Thebes þer be yere
And finally at request and preyere
Of Perotheus wiþoute ony Raunson
Duk Theseus him leet out of prison
ffrely to gon wher þat him list ouer al
In such a gise as I ȝou telle schal
This was þe forward pleinly for tendite 
Bitwixe Theseus and him Arcite
That if so were þat arcite were founde 
Euer in his lif by day or night or stounde
In eny contre of þis Theseus


And he were caught it was accorded þus
That with a swerd he scholde leese his heed
Ther was noon oþer remedie ne reed
But takeþ his leeue and homward he him spedde
Lat him be war his nekke liþ to wedde
How gret a sorwe suffreþ now arcite
The deth he feeleþ þurgh his herte smyte
He wepeþ weyleth crieþ pitously
To sleen himself he wayteþ priuely  
He seide allas þat day þat I was born
Now is my prison worse þan biforn
Now is me schape eternaly to dwelle
Nought in Purgatori but in helle
Allas þat euer I knew Perotheus
ffor elles hadde I haue dwelled with Theseus
Ifetered in his prison eueremo
Thanne hadde I ben in blisse and not in woo
Only þe sight of hire whom þat I serue
þough þat I neuer hire grace may deserue
Wolde haue ysuffised right ynough for me
 Oo deere Cosyn Palamon quod he
Thin is þe victorie of þis auenture
fful blissefully in prison might þou dure
In prisoun certes nay but paradys
Wel haþ fortune torned þe þe dys
That hast þe sight of hire and I þabsence 
ffor possible is syn þou hast hir presence
And art a knight a worþi and an able
That by som caas syn fortune is changeable
Thou maist somtyme to þi desir atteyne
But I þat am exiled and bareyne
Of alle grace and in so gret despeire
That þer nys erþe water fyr ne eyre
Ne creature þat of hem maked is 
That may me helpe or don confort in þis
Wel ought I sterue in wanhope and distresse


ffare wel my lif my lust and my gladnesse
Allas why pleynen men so in comune
Of purueance of god or of fortune
That ȝiueth hem ful ofte in many a gyse
Wel bet þan þey can hemself deuyse
Som man desireþ for to haue richesse
That cause is of his mordre or gret seknesse 
And som wolde out of his prison fain
That in his hous is of his meyne slain   
Infinite harmes ben in þis matiere
We wot not what þing þat we preyen heere 
We faren as he þat dronken is as Mous
A dronke man wot wel he haþ an hous
But he not which þe righte weie is þider
And to a dronke man þe weye is slider
And certes in þis world so faren we
We seeken fast after felicite
But we gon wrong ful ofte trewely
Thus may we seyn all and namlich I
That wende and hadde a gret opynion
That if I mighte skapen fro prison
Than hadde I ben in ioye and parfyt hele
Ther now I am exiled fro my wele
Syn þat I may not seen ȝou Emelye
I am but ded þer nys no remedye
vpon þat oþer syde Palamon
Whan þat he wiste þat arcite was gon
Swich sorwe he makeþ þat þe grete tour
Resouneþ of his yollyng and clamour
The pure fettres of his schynes grete
Were of his bittre salte teeres wete
Allas quod he arcita cosyn myn
Of all our strif god wot þe fruyt is þin
Thou walkest now in Thebes at þi large
And of my woo þou yernest litel charge
Thou maist syn þou hast wisdom and manhede


Assemble all þe folk of oure kinrede
And make a werre so scharp on þis Cite
That by som auenture or som tretee
Thou maist haue hir to lady and to wif 
ffor whom þat I most needes leese my lif
ffor as by weie of possibilite
Sitthe þou art at þi large of prison fre
And art a lord gret is þin auantage
More þan is myn þat sterue her in a kage  
ffor I mot weepe and wayle whil þat I lyue
With all þe woo þat prison may me ȝiue
And eek with peyne þat loue me yiueþ also
That doubleþ al my torment and my wo
Ther with þe fyr of gelousie vpsterte
With Inne his brest and hente him by þe herte
So woodly þat he lik was to byholde
The boxtre or þe asshen deed and colde
Than seide he o cruel goddes þat gouerne
This world with bynding of your word eterne
And writen in þe table of athamaunt
youre parlement and ȝour eterne graunt
What is mankynde more vnto ȝou holde
Than is þe scheep þat roukeþ in þe folde
ffor slain is man right as anoþer beeste
And dwelleþ eek in prison and in arreste
And haþ siknesse and gret aduersite
And ofte tymes gilteles parde
 What gouernance is in þis prescience
That gilteles tormenteþ Innocence
And encreseth þis is al my penaunce
That man is bounden to his obseruaunce
ffor goddes sake to letten of his wille
Ther as a beeste may all his lust fulfille
And whan a beeste is ded he haþ no peyne
But after his deth þe man mot weepe and pleyne
Though in þis world he haue care and wo


Wiþouten doute it may stonden so
The answere of þis lete I to diuines
But wel I wot þat in þis world gret pyne is
Allas I see a serpent or a þeef
That many a trewe man haþ do meschief
Gon at his large and wher him list may turne
But I moot ben in prison þurgh Saturne
And eek þurgh Iuno Ialous and eek wood
That haþ destroyed wel neyh al þe blood  
Of Thebes with his waste walles wide
And venus sleeþ me on þat oþer syde
ffor Ialousye and fere of him Arcite
 Now wil I stynte of Palamon alite
And lat him in his prison stille dwelle
And of Arcite forþ I wil ȝou telle
The somer passeþ and þe nightes longe
Encresceth double wise þe peynes stronge
Boþe of þe louer and of þe prisoner
I not which haþ þe wofuller myster
ffor schortly for to sein of Palamon
Perpetuelly is dampned to prison
In cheynes and in fettres to þe ded
And arcite is exiled vp his hed
ffor euermore as out of þat contre
Ne neuer he ne schal his lady se
 yow louers aske I now þis question
Who haþ þe wors arcite or Palamōn
That oon may seen his lady day by day
But in prison moot he duellen ay
That oþer wher him list may ride or go
But seen his lady schal he neuer mo
Now diuineth as ȝou list þat ȝe can
ffor I wol telle forth as I bigan
Whan þat arcite to Thebes comen was
fful ofte a day he swelte and saide allas
ffor seen his lady schal he neuere mo
And schortly to concluden al his wo
So mochel sorwe hadde neuer creature
That is or schal whil þat þe world may dure
His sleep  his mete  his drink is him byraft
That lene he wex and drye as is a schaft
His yghen holwe grisly to biholde
His hewe falwe and pale as ayssche colde
And solitarie he was and euer allone
And waylyng al þe night makyng his mone  
And if he herde song or instrument
Than wolde he weepe he mighte nought be stent
So feble were his spiritz and he lowe
And chaunged so þat no man couþe knowe
His speche noþer his voys þough men it herde
And in his gere for al þe world he ferde 
Not comly lyk to louers maladye
Of heres but raþer lik manye
Engendred of humour malencolik
Biforn his celle fantastik
And schortly torned was al vp and doun
Boþe habite and disposicioun
Of him þis woful louere daun arcite
What scholde I alday of his woo endite
Whan he endured hadde a ȝeer or tuo
This cruel torment and þis peyne and woo
At Thebes in his contre as I seyde
Vpon a night in sleep as he him leyde
Him þoughte þat þe wengede god mercurie
Biforn him stood and bad him to be merie
His sleepy ȝerde in honde he bar vpright
An hatte he wered vppon his heeres bright


Arrayed was þis god as he took keepe
As he was whan þat argus took his sleepe
And seyde him þus to Athenes schalt þou wende
Ther is þe schapen of þi wo an ende
And with þat word arcite wook and sterte
Now trewely how sore þat me smerte
Quod he to Athenes right now wol I fare
Ne for þe drede of deþ schal I nought spare
To see my lady þat I loue and serue 
In hire presence I ne recche nouȝt to sterue 
And with þat word he caughte a gret mirour
And saugh þat chaunged was al his colour
And saugh his visage al in anoþer kinde
And right anon it ran him in his mynde  
Than siþen his face was so disfigured
Of maladie þe which he hadde endured
He mighte wel if þat he bar him lowe
Lyue in Athenes eueremore vnknowe 
And seen his lady wel neigh day by day
And right anon he changed his array
And cladde him as a poure laborer
And al allone saf oonly a squier
That knew his priuete and al þe caas
Which was desgised pouerly as he was
To Athenes is he gon þe nexte way
And to þe courte he wente vpon a day
And atte gate he profred his seruise
To drugge and drawe what so men wol deuise
And schortly of þis matier for to sein
He fille in office with a chamburlein 
The which þat was dwellyng with Emelye
ffor he was wys and sone couþe aspye
Of euery seruant which þat serueþ here
Wel couþe he hewen woode and water bere
ffor he was yong and mighty for þe nones
And þerto he was strong and bigge of bones


To doon þat eny wight him can deuyse
A yeer or tuo he was in þis seruise
Page of þe Chambre of Emelye þe brighte
And Philostrat he seyde þat he highte
 But half so wel byloued aman as he
Ne was þer neuer in court of his degre
He was so gentil of condicioun
That þurgh out al the court was his renoun
Thei seide þat it were a charite
That Theseus wolde enhaunce his degre
And putten him in worschipful seruise
Ther þat he might his vertu excercise
And þus withinne a while his name is spronge
Boþe of his deedes and of his goode tonge  
That Theseus haþ taken him so neere
That of his Chambre he made him a squiere
And gaf him golde to mayntene his degre
And eek men brought him out of his contre
ffro ȝeer to ȝeer ful priuily his rente
But honestly and sleighly he it spente
That no man wondred how þat he it hadde
And þre ȝeer in þis wise his lif he ladde
And bar him so in pees and eek in werre
Ther was no man þat Theseus haþ derre
And in þis blisse lete I now arcite
And speke I wol of Palamon alite
 In derknesse and horrible and strong prison
This seuene ȝeer haþ seten Palamon
fforpyned what for woo and for distresse
Who feleth double sore and heuynesse
But Palamon þat loue drencheþ so 
That wood out of his wit he goþ for wo
And eek þer to he is a prisoner
Perpetuelly not oonly for a ȝeer
Who couþe ryme in englissh propurly
His martirdom for soþe it am not I


Ther fore I passe als lightly as I may
 It felle þat in þe seuenþe ȝer of may
The þridde night as olde bokes sein 
That als þis storie telleþ more plein
Were it by auenture or destinee
As whan a þing is schape it schal be
That sone after þe mydnyght Palamon
By helpyng of a frende brak prison
And fleþ þe cite faste as he may goo
ffor hadde yeue his gailler drunke soo
Of a clarre maad of a certeyn wyn
With nercotiks and opie of Thebes fyn
That al þat night þough þat men wolde him schake
Tbe gailler sleep he mighte not awake  
And þus he fleeth as fast as euer he may
The night was schort and faste by þe day
That needes cost he most himseluen hyde
And til a groue faste þer bisyde
With dredful foot þan stalkeþ Palamon
ffor schortly þis was his opinion
That in þat groue he wolde him hide alday
And in þe night þan wolde he take his way
To Thebesward his frendes for to pray
On Theseus to helpe him to werray
And schortly ouþer he wolde leese his lif
Or wynnen Emely to his louely wif 
This is þeffecte and his entente playn
 Now wol I torne vnto arcite agayn
That litel wiste how neih þat was his care
Til þat fortune hadde kaught him in his snare
The besy larke messanger of day
Salueth in hir song þe morwe gray
And fyry phebus riseþ vp so bright
That al þe orient laugheth of þe light
And with his streemes drieth in þe greues
The seluir dropes hangyng in þe leeues


And Arcita in þe court roial
Wiþ Theseus his squier principal
Is rysen and lokeþ on þe mery day
And for to doon his obseruance to may
Remembryng on þe poynt of his desir
He on his courser stertyng as þe fir
Is riden in to þe feeldes him to pleye
Out of þe court were it a myle or tweye
And to þe groue of which þat I ȝou tolde
By auenture his weye he gan to holde 
To maken him a garland of þe greues
Were it of woodebynde or hawethorne leeues
And loude he song aȝein þe sonne scheene 
May with all þi floures whit and grene  
Welcome be þou faire freisshe may
I hope þat I som grene gete may
And from his courser with a lusty herte
In to þe groue ful hastily he sterte
And in a path he rometh vp and doun
Ther as by auenture of þis Palamon
Was in a busshe þat no man might him see
fful sore aferd of his deth was he
No þing ne knewe he þat it was arcite
God wot he wolde haue trowed it ful lite
But soþ is seide go siþþen many ȝeeres
That feeld haþ yhen and þe woode haþ eeres
It is ful fair a man to bere him euene 
ffor alday meeteþ men at vnsett steuene
fful litel woot arcite of his felawe
That was so neigh to herken of his sawe
ffor in þe busshe he sitteþ now ful stille
Whan þat arcite hadde Romed all his fille
And songen al þe Roundel lustily
In to a studie he fel sodeinly
As doon þese louers in here queynte geeres
Now in þe croppe and now doun in þe breeres


Now vp now doun as boket in a welle
Right as þe friday soþly for to telle
Now it schineþ and now it reyneþ faste
Right so gan gery venus ouer caste
The hertes of hir folk right as hire day
Is geerful right so chaungeþ sche array
Seelde is þe fryday al þe wike ylike
 Whan þat arcite hadde songe he gan to syke
And sette him doun wiþouten eny more
Allas quod he þat day þat I was bore
How longe Iuno þurgh þi cruelte
Wiltow werreien Thebes þe Cite
Allas ybrought is to confusion
The blood Roial of Cadme and Amphion  
Of Cadmus which þat was þe ferste man
That Thebes bult or ferst þe toun bigan
And of þe cite first was crouned king
Of his lynage am I and his ofspring
By verray ligne as of þe stok roiall
And now I am so caytif and so þrall
That he þat is my mortel enemy
I serue him as his squier pouerly
And ȝit doþ me Iuno wel more schame
ffor I dar nought biknowe myn owne name
But þer as I was wont to hight arcite
Now highte I Philostrate nought worþ a myte
Allas þou felle mars allas þou Iuno
Thus haþ your ire oure lignage al fordo
Saf only me and wrecched Palamon
That Theseus martireþ in prison
And ouer al þis to slen me vtterly
loue haþ his faire dart so brennyngly
ystiked þurgh my trewe carful herte
That schapen was my deþ arst þan my scherte
ye sleen me with ȝour eyȝen emelye
Ȝe ben þe cause wher fore þat I dye


Of all þe remanant  of myn oþer care
Ne sette I nought þe montance of a tare
So þat I coude don aught to ȝoure plesance
And with þat word he fel doun in a traunce
A long tyme and aftirward he vpsterte
This Palamon þat þought þat þorugh his herte
he felte a cold swerd sodeinliche glyde
ffor yre he quok no lenger wolde he byde
And whan þat he had herd Arcites tale
As he were wood with face deed and pale
he sterte him vp out of þe buskes þikke
And seide arcite false traytour wikke
Now art þou hent þat louest my lady so
ffor whom þat I haue al þis peyne and wo  
And art my blood and to my counseil sworn
As I ful ofte haue told þe heer biforn
And hast beiaped here duk Theseus 
And falsly chaunged hast þi name þus
I wol be ded or elles þou schalt dye
Thou schalt not loue my lady Emelye
But I wol loue hire oonly and nomo
ffor I am Palamon þi mortel foo
And þough þat I no wepene haue in þis place
But out of prisoun am astert by grace
I drede nought þat ouþer þou schalt die
Or þou ne schalt not louen Emelye
Chees which þou wilt or þou schalt not asterte
This arcite with ful despitous herte
When he him knew and hadde his tale herde
As fers as a leon pulled out a swerde
And seide þus by god þa sitteþ aboue
Nere it were þat þou art sike and wood for loue
And eek þat þou no wepne hast in þis place 
Thou schuldest neuer out of þis groue pace
That þou ne schuldest deyen of myn honde
ffor I diffie þe sewrte and þe bonde


Which þat þou seist I haue maad to þe 
What verray fool þink weel þat loue is fre
And I wol loue hir maugre al þy might
But for as moche þou art a worþy knight
And willest to derreyne hir by batayle
Haue her my trouþe to morwe I wol nought fayle
Wiþouten wityng of eny oþer wight
That heer I wol be founden as a knight
And bringen herneys right ynough for þe
And chese þe beste and lef þe worste for me
And mete and drynk þis night wol y bringe
ynough for þe and cloþes for þi beddynge
And if so be þat þou my lady wynne
And sle me in þis woode þer I am Inne  
Thou mayst wel haue þy lady as for me
This Palamon answerd I graunt it þe
And þus þei ben departed til a morwe
Whan ech of hem hadde leyd his feiþ to borwe
Occupied out of alle charite
O regne þat wolde no felawe haue with þe
fful soþ is seid þat loue ne lorschipe
Wol not his þankes haue no felaschipe
We fynde þat of arcite and of Palamon
Arcite is riden anon in to þe toun
And on the morwe er it were dayes light
fful priuely tuo herneys haþ he dight
Boþe sufficant and meete to darreyne
The batail in þe feld bitwix hem tweyne
And on his hors allone as he was borne
He carieth al his harneys him biforne
And in þe groue at tyme and place yset
This arcite and þis Palamon ben mette
To changen gan þe colour in hire face
Right as þe hunters in þe Reigne of trace
That stondeþ atte gappe with a spere
Whan hunted is þe leoun or þe bere


And heereþ him come russhyng in þe greeues
And bereþ boþe bowes and þe leeues 
And þinkeþ here comeþ my mortel enemy
Wiþoute faile he moot be deed or I
ffor eiþer I mot sleen him atte gappe
Or he mot slee me if þat me mys happe
So ferden þei in chaungyng of here hewe
As fer as euerich of hem oþer knewe 
Ther nas no good day ne no saluynge 
But streit wiþouten word or rehersynge 
Euerich of hem hilp for to arme oþer
As freendly as he were his owne broþer
And after þat wiþ scharpe speres stronge 
They foynen ech at oþer wonder longe  
Thou mightest wene þat þis Palamon
In his fightinge were a wood leon
And as a cruel tigre was arcite
As wilde bores gonne þei to smyte 
That frothen whit as foom for ire wood
Vp to þe ancle foughte þey in here blood
And in þis wise I lete hem fightyng dwelle
And forþ I wole of Theseus you telle
The destenye Ministre general
That executeþ in þe world ouer al
The purueance þat god haþ seie bifore
So strong it is þat þei þe world hadde it swore
The contraire of a þing by ȝe or nay
Ȝet som tyme it schal falle on a day
Þat falleþ nought eft wiþinne a þousend ȝere
ffor certeinly oure appetites heere
Be it of werre or pees or hate or loue
Al is þis reuled by þe sight aboue
This mene I now by mighty Theseus
That for to hunte is so desirous
And namly atte grete hert in may
That in his bedde þer daweþ him no day


That he nys cladde and redy for to ride
Wiþ hunte and horn and houndes him besyde
ffor in his huntyng haþ he such delit
That it is all his ioye and appetyt
To ben himself þe grete hertes bane
ffor after mars he serueth now Diane
Cler was þe day as I haue told er þis
And Theseus with alle ioye and blys
With his ypolita þe faire queene
And Emelye cloþed al in greene
On huntyng ben þei riden really
And to þe groue þat stood ful faste by
In which þer was an hert as men him tolde
Duk Theseus þe streighte wey haþ holde   
And to þe lannde he rideþ him ful righte
ffor þider was þe hert wont to haue his flighte
And ouer a brook and so forþ on his wey
This Duk wol haue a cours at him or twey
Wiþ houndes swich as þat him list to comaunde 
And whan þis Duk was come vnto þe launde
vnder þe sonne he loked and anon
He was war of arcite and Palamon
That foughten breeme as it were boles tuo
The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro
So hidously þat with þe leste strook
It semeþ þat it wolde felle an ook
But what þei were noþing he ne woot
This duk his courser with his spores smot
And at a stert he was betwixe hem tuo
And pulled out a swerd and cried ho
No more vp peyne of lesyng of ȝour hed
By mighty mars he schal anon be ded
That smyteth eny strok þat I may seen
But telleþ me what myster men ȝe ben
That ben so hardy for to fighten heere
Wiþoute Iuge or oþer officere


As it were in a litell liste really
 This Palamon answerde hastily
And seide sire what needeþ wordes mo
We haue þe deþ deserued boþe tuo
Tuo woful wrecches be we tuo caytyues
That ben encombred of oure owne lyues
And as þou art a rightful lord and Iuge
Ne ȝiue us neyþer mercy ne refuge
But slee me first for seinte charite
But slee my felawe eek as wel as me
Or slee him  for þough þou knowest it lite
This is þi mortel fo þis is arcite
That fro þi lond is banyssched on his heede
ffor which he haþ deserued to be ded  
ffor þis is he þat com vnto þi gate
And seyde þat he highte Philostrate
Thus haþ he Iaped þe ful many a ȝeere 
And þou hast maked him þi cheef squiere
And þis is he þat loueþ Emelye
ffor siþ þat day is come þat I schal dye
I make pleynly my confession
That I am þilke woful Palamon
That haþ þi prison broke wikkedely
I am þi mortel foo and it am I
That loueþ so hote Emelya þe bright
That I wol dye present in hir sighte
Wher fore I axe deþ and my Iuwise
But sle my felawe in þe same wise
ffor boþe haue we deserued to be slayn
 This worþi duk answerde anon agayn
And seide þis is a schort conclusioun
your owne mouþ be ȝoure confessioun
Haþ dampned ȝou and I wol it recorde
It needeþ nought to pyne ȝou with þe corde
ye schal be ded by mighty mars þe reede
The queen anon for verrey wommanhede


Com for to wepe and so dide Emelye
And all þe ladies of þe compaignye
Gret pite was it as it þought hem alle
That euer such a chaunce schulde falle
ffor gentil men þei were of gret estat
And noþing but for loue was þis debat
And saugh hire bloody woundes wide and sore
And alle cryeden boþe lasse and more
Haue mercy lord vpon vs wommen alle
And on here bare knees doun þei falle
And wolde haue kist his feet þer as he stood
Til atte last aslaked was his mood
ffor pite renneþ sone in gentil herte 
And þough he ferst for Ire quook and sterte  
he haþ considered schortly in a clause
The trespas of hem bothe and eek þe cause
And al þough þat his Ire hire gilt accused
Ȝit in his reson he hem boþe excused
As þus he þoughte wel þat euery man
Wil helpe himself in loue if þat he can
And eek deliuere himself out of prison
And eek his herte hadde compassion
Of wommen for þey wepen euer in oon
And in his gentil herte he þought anon
And softe vnto himself he seide fy
vpon a lord þat wol haue no mercy
But be a leon boþe in word and dede 
To hem þat ben in repentance and drede
As wel as to a proud dispitous man
That wol maintene þat he first bigan
That lord haþ litel of discrecion
That in such cas can no diuision
But weyeth pride and humblesse after oon
And schortly whan his Ire is þus goon
he gan to loken vp with eyghen light
And spak þis same wordes al on hight


 The god of loue a benedicite
How mighty and how gret a lord is he
Aȝeins his might þer gayneþ non obstacles
He may be cleped a god of his miracles
ffor he can maken at his owne gise
Of euerich herte as þat him list deuise
lo her þis arcite and þis Palamon
That quytly were out of my prisoun
And might haue lyued in Thebes rially
And witen I am here mortel enemy
And þat here deþ lith in my might also 
And ȝit haþ loue maugre here yghen tuo
Brought hem hider boþe for to deye
Now lokeþ is not þat an heih folye  
 Who may ben a fool but if he loue
Byhold for goddes sake þat sitteþ aboue
See how þai bleede be þai not wel arrayed
Thus haþ hire lord þe god of loue ypaiȝed
Hire wages and hire fees for hire seruise
And ȝit þei wenen for to ben ful wise
That seruen loue for aught þat may bifall
But þis is ȝet þe beste game of all
That sche for wham þei haue þis iolyte
Can hem þerfore as moche thank as me
Sche woot na more of all þis hoote fare
By god þan woot a Cockow of an hare
But al moot ben assayed hoot and colde
A man moot ben a fool or ȝong or olde
I wot it by my self ful yore agon
ffor in my tyme a seruant was I on
And þerfore syn I knowe of loues peyne
And woot how sore it can a man distreyne
As he þat hath ben caught often in his laas
I you forȝiue al holly þis trespas
At þe requeste of þe queen þat kneeleþ heere
And eek of Emelye my soster deere


And ȝe schal boþe anon vnto me swere
That neuere ȝe schal my coroune dere
Ne make werre vpon me night ne day
But ben my frendes in alle þat ȝe may
I ȝou forȝiue þis trespas euery del
And þey him sworen his axing fair and wel
And him of lordschipe and of mercy preide
And he hem graunteþ grace and þus he seide
To speke of riall lynage and richesse
þough þat sche were a queen or a princesse
Ech of ȝou boþe is worþy douteles
To wedde whan tyme is but naþeles
I speke as for my suster Emelye 
ffor whom ȝe haue þis strif and Ialousie  
Ȝe wite ȝoure self sche may not wedde tuo
At oones þough ȝe fighten eueremo
That oon of ȝou al be him loþ or leef
He moot go pypen in an yuy leef
This is to sey sche may not haue boþe
Al be ȝe neuer so Ialouse ne so wroþe
And forþi I ȝou putte in þis degre
That ech of ȝou schal haue his destine
As him is schape and kerkneþ in what wise
Lo heer ȝour ende of þat I schal deuyse 
 My wil is þis for plat conclusion
Wiþouten eny replicacion
If þat ȝow likeþ takeþ it for þe beste 
That euerych of ȝou schal gon wher him leste
ffrely wiþouten Raunceon or daunger
And þis day fifty wykes fer ne neer
Euerich of ȝou schal bringe an hundred knightes
Armed for þe lystes vp al rightes
Al redy to darreyne hir by bataile
And þis biheete I ȝou wiþoute faile
vpon my trouþe and as I am a knight
That wheþer of ȝou boþe þat haþ might


This is to sein þat wheþer he or þou
May with his hundred as I spak of now
Sle his contrarie or out of lystes dryue
That schal I ȝiue Emelya to wyue
To whom þat fortune ȝeueþ so fair a grace
The lystes schal I maken in þis place
And god so wisly on my soule rewe
As I schal euen Iugge ben and trewe
ȝe schal non oþer eende wiþ me maken
þat on of ȝou schal ben deed or taken
And if ȝou þinkeþ þis is wel ysayed
Sey ȝour avys and holdeþ ȝou appaied
This is ȝour ende and ȝour conclusion
Who lokeþ lighty now but Palamon  
Who springeþ vp for ioye but arcite
Who couþe telle or who couþe it endite
The ioye þat is maked in þe place
Whan Theseus haþ don so fair a grace
But doun on knees went euery maner wight
And þonked him wiþ all here hert and might
And namely þe Thebanes ofte siþe
And þus wiþ good hope and wiþ herte bliþe
They take þeir leue and homward gon þei ride
To Thebes with olde walles wyde
I trowe men wold it deme necligence
yf I forȝete te tellen þe dispense
Of Theseus þat goþ so busily
To maken vp þe lystes ryally
That such a noble theatre as it was
I dar wel seyn in þe world þer nas
The circuite a Mile was aboute
Walled of stoon and diched al wiþoute
Round was þe schap in maner of compas


fful of degrees þe heighte of sixty paas
Than whan a man was sette on oo degre
He lettede nought his felawe for to see
Estward þer stood a gate of marbel white
Westward right south anoþer in opposite
And schortly to conclude such a place
Was non in erþe as in so litel a space
ffor in þe lond þer nas no crafty man
That Geometrie or ars metrike can
Ne purtreiour ne keruer of ymages
That Theseus ne gain him mete and wages
The Teatre for to make and deuyse
And for to don his rite and sacrifise
he estward hath vpon þe gate aboue
In worschip of Venus þe goddesse of loue
Don make an auter and an oratorie
And of þe westward in memorie  
Of Mars he maked hath right such anoþer
That coste largely of gold a foþer
And northward in a toret on þe walle
Of alabaustre whit and reed coralle
An oratori riche for to see
In worschip of Diane of chastite
hath Theseus don wrought in noble wise
But ȝit hadde I forgetyn to deuyse
þe noble peyntyng and þe purtraitures
The schap þe contienance and þe figures
That weren in þise oratories þre
fferst in þe temple of venus maist þou se
Wrought in þe walle ful pitous to biholde
The broken sleepes and þe sikes colde
þe sacrede teeres and þe waymentyng
The fyre strokes of þe desyring
That loues seruantz in þis lijf enduren
The othes þat here couenantz ensuren
Plesant and hope desir folhardynesse


Beaute and youþe bauderie Richesse
Charmes and force lesynges flaterie
Dispense bysynesse and Ialousie
That werede of yalow of gooldes a garlond
And a cukkow sittyng on his hond
ffestes instrumentz karoles daunces
lust and array and all þe circumstances
Of loue which þat rekned and rekene schal
By ordre were peynted on þe wal
And mo þan I can make of mencion
ffor sothly al þe mont of Citheron
Ther venus haþ hir principal dwellyng
Was schewed on þe wal in portreying
Wiþ al þe gardyn and þe lustynesse
Nat was forȝeten þe porter ydelnesse
Ne Narcisus þe faire of yore agon
Ne yet þe folie of king Salomon  
Ne ȝit þe grete strengþe of Hercules
Thenchauntementz of Medea and Circes
Ne of Turnus wiþ þe hardy fiers corrage
The riche Crysus kaytif in seruage 
Thus may ȝe seen þat wisdom ne richesse
Beaute ne sleighte strengþe ne hardynesse 
Ne may wiþ venus holde champartye
ffor as hire list þe world þanne may sche gye
lo all þise folk so kaught were in here lace
Til þei for woo ful ofte seyde allase
Suffiseth here ensamples oon or tuo
And þough I couþe rekne a þousand mo
The statue of venus glorious for to see
Was inaked fleetyng in þe large see
And fro þe nauel doun al couered was
Wiþ wawes greene and bright as eny glas
O citole in hir right hond hadde sche 
And on hire heed ful semely for to see
A rose garlond freissch and wel smellynge


Aboue hir heed her doufes flykerynge
Biforn hire stoode hir sone Cupido
vpon his schuldernes wenges hadde he tuo
And blynd he was as it is ofte seene 
A bowe he bar and arwes bright and keene
Whi schulde I nought as wel eek telle þe halle
The purtraiture þat was vpon þe walle 
Wiþinne þe temple of mighty mars þe reede
Al peynted was þe wal in lengþe and brede 
lik to þe eestres of þe grisly place
That highte þe grete temple of Mars in trace
In þilke colde frosty regioun
Ther as Mars haþ his soueraigne mansioun
ffirst on þe wal was peynted a foreste
In which þer dwelled neyþer man ne beste
Wiþ knotty knarry bareyne trees olde
Of Stubbes scharpe and hidous to biholde  
In which þer ran a Rombel in a swough
And þought a storm schulde bresten euery bough
And dounward from an hull vnder a bente
Ther stood þe temple of mars armypotente
Wrought all of burned steel of which þentre
Was long and streyt and gastly for to see
And þer out cam a rage and such a vese
That it made all þe gates for to rese
The northerne light in atte dores schone
ffor wyndowe on þe wall ne was þer none
Thorugh which men mighte eny light discerne
The dores waren all of Atthemant eterne
ychenchede ouertwart and endlong
Wiþ Iren towgh and for to make it strong
Euery piler þe temple to sustene
Was tonne gret of Iren bright and scheene
Ther say I ferst þe derk ymagynynge
Of felonye and al þe compassynge
The cruel Ire reed as eny glede


The pykpurs and eek þe pale drede
The smyler wiþ þe knyf vnder þe cloke
The schepene brennyng wiþ þe blake smoke
The tresoun of þe morthering in þe bedde
The open werre wiþ woundes all bibledde
Contek wiþ bloody knyf and scharp manace
Al ful of schrikyng was þat sory place
The sleer of himself yet saugh I þere
His herte hath baþed al his here
The nayl ydryuen in þe schood on night
The colde deth wiþ mouþ gapende vpright
Amyddes of þe temple sat meschance
With disconfort and sory contenance
yet saugh I woodnesse laughyng in his rage
Armed compleint  out hees and feers outrage
The karoigne in þe busk wiþ þrote ykorue
A þousand yslayn and nought of qualme ystorue  
The Tiraunt with his preye his force thraste 
The toun destroied þer was noþing lafte
yet saugh I brent þe schippes hoppestereres
The hunte strangled wiþ þe wilde breeres 
The sowe freten þe child right in þe cradel
The Cook Iscalded for al his longe ladel
Nought was forgeten by þe infortune of marte 
The carter ouerRiden wiþ his carte
vnder þe wheel ful lowe he lay a doun
Ther were also of martis diuisioun
The barbour and þe bocher and þe smith
That forge scharpe swerdes on his stith
And all aboue depeynted in a toure
Saugh I conqueste in gret honoure
With þe scharpe swerd ouer his heed
Hangynge by a subtyl twyned þreed
Depeynted was þe slaughtre of Iulius
Of grete Nero and of Anthonius
Al be þat ilke time þei were vnborn


Ȝet was hire deth depeynted þer biforn
By manasyng of mars right by figure
So was it schewed right in þat purtreiture
As is depeynted in þe sertres aboue
Who schal be slain or elles deed for loue
Sufficeþ oon ensample in stories olde
I may not rekne hem alle þough I wolde
The statue of mars vpon a carte stood
Armed and loked grym as he were wood
And ouer his heed þer schineþ tuo figures
Of sterres þat ben closed in scriptures
That oon Puella þat oþer Rubeus
This god of armes was arrayed þus
A wolf þer stood biforn him at his feete
Wiþ eighen reede and of a man he eete
Wiþ subtill pensell was depeynted þis storie 
In redoutyng of mars and of his glorie  
Now to þe temple of Diane þe chaste 
As schortly as I can I wol me haste
To telle ȝou all þe discripcioun
Depeynted ben þe walles vp and doun
Of huntyng and of schamefast chastite
Ther saugh I how woful Calistope
Whan þat Diane agreued was with here
Was torned fro a womman til a bere 
And after was sche maad þe loodesterre
Þus was sche peynted I can ȝou seye no ferre
Hire sone is eek a sterre as men may se
Ther saugh I dane torned til a tree
I mene nat þe goddesse Diane
But Penneus doughter which þat highte Dane
 Ther saugh I accheon an herte ymaked
ffor vengance þat he saugh Diane al naked
I saugh how þat his houndes haue him caught
and freten him for þat þei knewe him naught
yet ypeynted was a litel forþere more 


how atthalance hounted þe wilde bore
And Meliagre and many anoþer mo
ffor which Diane wrought him care and wo
Ther saugh I many anoþer storie 
The which me list nat drawe to memorie 
 This goddesse on an hert ful wel hiegh seet
Wiþ smale honndes all aboute hir feet
And vnder neþe hire feet sche hadde a moone
Wexynge it was and schulde wanye soone
In gaude greene hir statue cloþed was
Wiþ bowe in honde and arwes in a caas
Hir eyhen caste sche ful lowe a doun
Ther Pluto haþ his derke regioun
A womman trauaillynge was hire biforn
But for hire childe so longe was vnborn
fful pitouly lucyna gan sche calle
And seyde helpe for þou mayst best of alle  
Wel couþe he peynte lifly þat it wrought
Wiþ many a floreyne he þe hewes bought
Now ben þise listes maad an Theseus
That at his grete cost arraied thus
The temples and þe Theatres euerydel
Whan it was don him liked wonder wel
 But stynte I wol of Theseus alite
And speke of Palamon and of arcite
The day approcheþ and hir retornynge
That eueriche scholde an hundred knightes bringe
The bataille to darrayne as I ȝou tolde
And til athenes hire couenant for to holde
Haþ euerych of hem brought an C knightes
Wel armed for þe werre at alle rightes
And sikerly þer trowed many a man
That neuer siþþen þat þe world bigan
That for to speke of knighthode of here hond
As ferre as god haþ maked see or lond
Nas of so fewe so noble a companye


ffor euery wight þat loued chiualrie
And wolde his þankes haue a passant name
Haþ preyed þat he mighte ben of þat game
A wel was him þat þer to chosen was 
ffor if þer fille to morwe such a caas
Ȝe knowe wel þat euery lusty knight
That loueþ paramours and haþ his might
Were it in Ingelond or elles where
Thei wolde here þankes wilnen to be þere
To fighte for a lady benedicite
It were a lusty sighte for to see
And right so ferden þey with Palamon
With him þer wente knightes many on
Som wol ben armed in an habergeon
And in a brest plate and in a light Iepon
And some wol haue a paire plates large
And som wil haue a pruce scheld or a targe  
Som wol ben armed on his legges wel
and haue an axe and som a mace of steel
Ther nys no newe gyse þat it nas olde
Armed were þei as I haue ȝou tolde
Euerich after his opynioun
Ther maystow see comyng wiþ Palamon
ligurge himself þe grete king of trace
Blak was his berd and manly was his face
The cercles of his yhen in his heede
Thei gloweden bitwixe yelow and rede
And lik a griffon loked he aboute
With kempe heres on his browes stoute
his lymes grete his braunes harde and strong
his schuldernes brode his armes round and long
And as þe gyse was in his cuntre
fful heighe vpon a chaar of gold stood he
Wiþ foure white boles in þe trays
In stede of cote armour ouer his harnays
Wiþ nayles yelowe and bright as eny golde


he hadde a berskynne coleblak for olde
his longe her was kembed byhynde his bak
As eny rauenes feþer it schon for blak
A wreþe of gold arme gret of huge weighte
vpon his heed sette ful of stones brighte
Of fyne Rubies and of Diamantz
Aboute his chaar þer wente wit Alantz
Twenty and mo as gret as eny steere
To hunten atte leon or þe deere
And folwed him with mosel fast ybounde
Coleres of gold and torettes filed rounde
An C lordes hadde he in his route
Armed ful wel wiþ hertes sterne and stoute
 With arcita in stories as men fynde
The grete Emetreus þe king of Inde
vpon a steede bay trapped in steel
Couered in cloth of gold diapred weel  
Com ridyng lyk þe god of armes mars
His cote armure was of cloþ of Tars
Couched with perles whit and round and grete 
His sadel was of brent gold newe I bete
A mantelet vpon his schuldern hangynge
Bret ful of Rubyes reede as fyr sparclynge
His crispe her lik rynges was Ironne
And þat was yelow and glitering as þe sonne
His nose was highe his eyen bright Cytryn
His lippes rounde his colour was sanguyn
A fewe frakenes in his face yspreynd
Betwixe yelow and somdel blak ymeynd
And as a leon he his lokyng caste
Of fyue and twenty ȝeer his age I caste
His berd was wel begonne for to springe
His voys was as a trompe thunderinge
vpon his heed he wered a laurer grene
A garland freissche and lusty for to seene
vpon his hand he bar for his deduyt


An Egle tame as eny lilie whit
An C lordes hadde he with him þere
All armed saue her heedes in al here gere
fful richely in alle maner þinges
ffor trusteþ wel þat Dukes Erles kynges
Were gadred in þis noble companye
ffor loue and for encrees of chiualrie
aboute þis king þer ran on euery part
fful many a tame leon and lepart
And in þis wise þise lordes all and some
Ben on þe soneday to þe Cite come
Aboute prime and in þe toun alighte
This Theseus þis Duk þis worþi knighte
Whan he hadde brought hem in to his Cite
And Inned hem euerich at his degre 
He festeþ hem and doþ so gret labour
To eesen hem and don hem all honour  
That yet men weneþ þat no mannes wit
Of non estat ne couþe amenden it 
The menstralcye þe seruise atte feste
The grete ȝiftes to þe meste and leste
The riche array of Theseus Paleys
Ne who sat ferst ne last vpon þe deys
What ladies fairest ben or best daunsynge
Or which of hem can best daunsen or synge 
Ne who most felynglik spekeþ of loue
What haukes sitten on þe perche aboue 
What houndes liggen on þe flor adoun
Of all þis make I now no mencioun
But alle þeffecte þat þinkeþ me þe beste
Now comeþ þe poynt and herkneþ if ȝou lest
 The sonday night ar day bigan to springe
Whan Palamon þe larke herde synge
Al þough it  nere nought day by houres tuo
Ȝet song þe larke and Palamon right þo
Wiþ holy herte and with an heigh corage


He ros to wenden on his pilgrimage
vnto þe blisful Citharea benigne
I mene Venus honorable and digne
And in here houre he walkeþ forþ a paas
vnto þe lystes þer hire temple was
And doun he kneleþ and wiþ humble chere
And herte sore he seyde as ȝe schal heere
 ffairest of faire O lady myn Venus
Doughter to Ioue and spouse to Vulcanus
Thou glader of þe mount of Citheron
ffor þilke loue þou haddest to adon
Haue pite of my bittre teeres smerte 
and tak myn humble preier at þin herte
Allas I ne haue no langage to telle 
Theffectes ne þe torment of myn helle
Myn herte may myn harmes nought bewreye
I am so confuse þat I can not seye  
But mercy lady bright þat knowest wele
My þought and seest what harmes þat I feele
Considere al þis and rewe vpon my soore
As wisly as I schal for euermore
Emforth my myght þi trewe seruant be
And holden werre alwey wiþ chastite
That I make myn avow so ȝe me helpe
I keepe nought of armes for to yelpe
Ne I ne axe nought to morwe to haue victorie
Ne renoun in þis caas ne veine glorie
Of pris of armes blowen vp and doun
But I wolde haue fully possessioun
Of emelye and dye in þi seruise
ffynde yow þe maner how and in what wise
I recche nat but it may bettre be
To haue victorie of hem or þei of me
So þat I may haue my lady in myn armes
ffor þough so be þat mars is god of armes
youre vertue is so gret in heuen aboue


That if yow list I schal wel haue my loue
Thy temple wil I worschipe euermo
An on þin auter wher I ride or go
I wil don sacrifice and feeres beete
And if ȝe wol not so my lady sweete
Than pray I þe to morwe with a spere
þat arcite me þurgh þe herte bere
Than rekke I nat whan I haue lost my lyf
þough þat arcite wynne hir to his wyf
This is þeffect and ende of my preyere
yif me my loue þou blisful lady deere
Whan þe orison was don of Palamon

fful pitously wiþ alle circumstances
Al telle I not as now his obseruances
But atte laste þe Statue of Venus schook
And made a signe wherby þat he took  
That his prayer accepted was þat day
ffor þough þe signe schewed a delay
Ȝit wist he weel þat graunted was his boone
And with glad herte he went him home ful soone
The þridde hour inequal þat Palamon
Bigan to venus temple for to gon
vp roos þe sonne and vp roos Emelye
And to þe temple of Diane gan hye
Hir maydenes þat þider with hir ladde
fful redily with hem þe fyr þey hadde
Thencens þe cloþes and þe remenant all
That to þe sacrifice longen schall
The hornes full of methe as was þe gise
Ther lacked nat to do hir sacrifise
Smokyng þe temple ful of cloþes faire
This Emelye with herte debonaire
Hire body  with þe water of a welle
But how sche dide hire rite I dar not telle
But it be eny þing in general


And ȝit it were a game to here it al
To him that meneþ wel it nere no charge
But it is good a man be at his large
hire brighte heer was kempt vntressed al
A Corone of a grene oke Serial
vpon hire heed set ful faire and mete
Tuo fyres on þe auter gan sche beete
And dede hire þinges as men may biholde
In Stace of Thebes and þise bookes olde
Whan kyndled was þe fyr wiþ pitous cheere
vnto Diane sche spak as ȝe may heere
O chaste goddesse of þe woodes greene
To whom boþe heuen and erþe and see is seene
Queen of þe regne of Pluto dirk and lowe
Goddesse of maydenes þat myn herte hast knowe

As keepe me fro þi vengance and þin Ire  
That attheon aboughte cruelly

Ne neuer wol I be no loue ne wijf
I am þou wost ȝit of þy compaignie
A maiden and loue huntyng and venerie
And for to walken in the woodes wilde
And nought to ben a wijf and be wiþ childe
Nought wol I knowe compaignie of man
Now helpe me lady siþþe ȝe may and can
ffor þe þre formes þat þou hast in the
And Palamon þat haþ swich loue to me
And eek arcite þat loueþ me so sore
This grace I preye ȝow wiþoute more
And sende loue and pees bitwixe hem tuo
And fro me torne awey here hertes so
That all here hoote loue and here desire
And all here besy torment and here fire
Be queynt or torned in anoþer place


And if so be þou wolt not do me grace
Or if my destyne be schape so
That I schal needes haue oon of hem tuo
As sende me him that most desireth me
Biholde goddesse of clene chastite
The bittre teeres þat on my cheekes falle
Syn þou art maiden and kepere of vs alle
My maydenhode þou kepe and wel conserue
And whil I lyue a maide I wol ȝou serue
 The fires brennen vpo þe auter cleer
Whil Emelye was þus in hire preyer
But sodeinly sche saugh a sighte queynte
ffor right anon on of þe fyres queynte
And quiked agayn and after þat anon
That oþer fyr was queint and al agon
And as it queinte it made a whistlinge
As don þese wete brondes in here brennynge   
And at þe brondes ende out ran anon
As it were bloody dropes many on
ffor which so sore agast was Emelye
That sche was ful ny mad and gan to crie
ffor sche ne wiste what it signefied
But oonly for þe feer þus haþ sche cried
And weepe þat it was pite for to heere
And þer with al Diane gan appeere
With bowe in hand right as an hunteresse
And seyde doughter stynt þin heuynesse
Among þe goddes heigh it is affermed
And by eterne word writen and confermed
Thou schalt be wedded vnto oon of þo

And vnto which of hem I may not telle
ffarwel for I ne may no lenger dwelle
The fyres which þat on myn auter brenne
Schul þe declare ar þat ȝe gon henne 
Thin auenture of loue as in þis caas


And wiþ þat word þe arwes in þe caas
Of þe goddesse clateren faste and rynge
And forþ sche wente and made a vanysschynge
ffor which þis Emelye astoned was
And seide what amonteþ þis allas

And home sche goþ anon þe nexte weye
This is þeffecte þer nys namore to seye

Of fiers mars to don his sacrifise
Wiþ all þe rites of his payen wise
Wiþ pitous hert and heigh deuocion
Right þus to mars he seide his orison
O stronge god þat in þe regnes colde 
Of trace honoured art and lord yholde  
And hast in euery regne and euery londe
Of armes al þe bridel in þin honde
And hem fortunest as þe lest deuyse
Accepte of me my pitous sacrifise 
If so be þat my youthe may deserue
And þat I mighte be worthy for to serue
Thy godhede þat I may ben oon of þine
Than pray I þe to rewe vpon my pyne

In which þou whilom brendest for desire
Whan þat þou vsedest þi beaute
Of faire ȝonge freissche Venus free 
And haddest hire in armes at þi wille
Al þough þe oones on a tyme mysfille 
Whan Walcanus hadde caught þe in his laas
And fond þe ligging by his wijf allas

Ne reccheþ neuer wher I synke or fleete
And wel I woot ar sche me mercy heete

And wel I woot wiþoute helpe or grace
Of þe ne may my strengþe nought auaile
Than helpe me lord to morwe in my bataille

As wel as þilke fir now brenneþ me
And do þat I to morwe haue victorie

Thy souerein temple wil I most honouren
Of eny place and alwey most labouren
In þi plesance and in þi craftes stronge
And in þi temple I wil my baner honge  
And all þe armes of my companye
And eueremo vnto til þat day I dye
Eterne fire I wol byfore þe fynde
And eek to þis avow I wil me bynde

That neuer ȝet ne felte offensioun
Of rasour nor of schere I wil þe yiue
And ben þi trewe seruant whil I liue
Now lord haue rouþe vpon my sorwes sore

The rynges on the temple dore þat honge
And eek þe dores clateren ful faste
Of which arcita somwhat him agaste

That it gan al þe temple for to light
And sweete smel the ground anon vp yaf

And with þe soun he herd a mormoringe

And right anon such strif is bygonne

Men may þe olde at renne and nought atrede

Al be it þat it is agayn his kinde
Of all þis strif he gan remedye fynde
My deere doughter Venus quod Saturne

Haþ more power þan wot any man

Wil I dwelle in þe signe of þe leon

Though mars schal helpe his knight ȝet naþeles

Of mars and of venus goddesses of loue
And telle yow as pleinly as I can

Som holden with him with þe blake berde
Som wiþ þe balled som with þe þikke herde  
Som seide he loked grym and he wold fighte
He haþ a Sparth of xx pound of highte
Thus was þe halle ful of diuinyng
longe after þat þe sonne gan to spring
The grete Theseus þat of his sleep awaked
Wiþ menstralcye and noyse þat was maked
Heeld ȝet þe chambres of his paleys riche
Til þat þe Thebane knightes boþen Iliche
Honorably weren in to þe paleys fette
Duc Theseus is at þe wyndow sette
Arraied right as he were god in trone
The poepel presed þiderward fulsone 
Him for to seen and don heigh reuerence 
And eek to herkne his heste and his sentence
An herald on a scaffold made an hoo
Til al þe noise of þe poepul was Idoo


And whan he say þe pepul of noyse al stille
Thus schewed he þe mighty dukes wille
The lord hath of his heigh discrecion
Considered þat it were destruccion
To gentil blood to fighten in þis gise
Of mortel bataille now in þis emprise
Wher fore to schapen þat þei schal not deye
He wol his ferste purpos modifye
No man þerfore vpon peyne of his lyf
No maner schot ne pollax ne schort knyf
In to þe lystes sende or þider brynge
Ne schort swerd for to stoke with poynt bytynge
No man ne drawe ne bere it by his syde
No man schal to his felawe ride
But oo cours with a scharp ygrounde spere
ffoyne if him list on foote himself to were 
And he þat is at meschief schal be take
And nought slain but be brought vnto þe stake
That schal ben ordeyned on eyþer syde 
But þider he schal be force and þer abyde   
And if so falle þe cheuentein be take 
On eyther syde or elles sleen his make
No lenger ne schal þe torneyenge laste
God speede ȝou go forth and lay on faste 
Wiþ longe swerdes and ȝour maces fighteþ ȝour fille
Go now your wey þis is þe lordes wille
The voys of þe poeple touchede heuene
So lowde criede þei with merie steuene
God saf swich a lord þat is so good
He wilneþ no distruction of blood
Vp goþ þe trompes and þe melodye
And to þe listes ritte the compaignye
By ordinance þorugh out þe cite large
Hanged wiþ cloþ of gold and nought with Sarge 
fful lik a lord this noble duk gan ryde
These tuo Thebanes vpon eyþer syde


And after roode þe queene and Emelye 
And after þat another compaignye 
Of on and oþer after here degre
And þus þey passen þurgh out þe Citee
And to þe lystes come þey be tyme
It nas nat of þe day ȝet fullich prime
Whan sette was Theseus ful riche and hye
ypolita þe queen and Emelye
And oþer ladyes in degree aboute
vnto þe seetes preseþ al þe route
And westward þurgh þe gates vnder marte
Arcite and eek þe hundred of his parte
Wiþ baner reed is entred right anon
And in þat selue moment Palamon
Is vnder venus Estward in þe place
Wiþ baner whit and hardy chere and face
In al þe world to seken vp and doun
So euene wiþoute variacioun
Ther nere swiche companyes tweye
ffor þer was non so wys þat couþe seie  
That eny hadde of oþer auantage
Of worþinesse ne of astaat ne age
So euene were þei chose for to gesse
And in to Rynges faire þei hem dresse
Whan þat here names rad were euerychon
That in here nombre gyle were þer non
Tho were þe gates schette and cryed was lowde
Do now ȝour deuoir yonge knightes proude
 The heraudes lefte here prikyng vp and doun
Now ryngeþ trompes lowde and clarioun
Ther is namore to sein West and Est
In goþ þe speres ful sadly in arest
In goþ the scharpe spore in to þe syde
þer seen men who can Iustne and who can ryde
Ther schyueren schaftes vpon scheeldes þikke
He feeleþ þorugh þe herte spoon þe prikke


vp springeþ speres twenty foot on heighte
Out gon þe sweerdes as þe seluer brighte
The helmes þer to hewen and to schrede
Out brest þe blood with sterne streemes reede
With mighty maces þe bones þei tobreste
he þurgh þe þikkest on þe þrong gan þreste
Ther stomblen steedes stronge and doun gon alle
he rolleþ vnder foot as doþ a balle
he foyneþ on his foot with his tronchoun
And he him hurteþ with his hors a doun
he þurgh þe body is hurt and siþþen take
Maugre his heed and brought vnto þe stake
As forward was right þer he moste abyde
Anoþer is ladde on þat oþer syde
And som tyme doþ hem Theseus to reste
hem to refreissche and drynken if hem leste
fful ofte aday han þise Thebanes two
Togydre ymett and wrought his felawe wo
vnhorsed haþ ech oþer of hem tweye
Ther nas no Tygre in vale of Galgopheie  
Whan þat hire whelp is stole whan it is lite
So cruel on þe hunte as is Arcite
ffor Ialouse herte vpon þis Palamon
Ne in belmaryn þer nys so fel leon
That hunted is or for his hunger wood
Ne of his prey desireþ so þe blood
Of Palamon to sle his foo arcite
The Ialous strokes on here helmes byte
Out renneth blood on boþe here sydes reed
Som tyme an ende þer is of euery deed
ffor or þe sonne vnto þe reste wente
The stronge king Emetreus gan hente
This Palamon as he faught with arcite
And made his sweerd deepe in fleissh byte
And by þe force of twenty is he take
vnyolden and drawen to þe stake


And in þe rescous of þis Palamoun
The stronge knight ligurge is born a doun
And king Emetreus for all his strengþe
Is born out of his sadell a swerdes lengthe
So hitte him Palamon or he were take
But al for nought he was brought to þe stake
his hardy herte might him helpe naught
he moste abide whan þat he was caught
By force and eek by composicion
Who sorweþ now but woful Palamon
Þat moot nomore gon aȝen to fighte
And whan þat Theseus hadde seen þis sighte
he cried ho namore for it is don
Ne non schal lenger to his felaw gon
I wil be trewe Iugge and not partie 
Arcite of Thebes schal haue Emelye
That by his fortune haþ hir faire ywonne
Anon þer is a noyse of poepel bygonne
ffor ioye of þis so loude and heigh wiþ alle 
It semed þat þe lystes scholde falle  
 What can now faire venus don aboue
What seiþ sche now what doþ þis queen of loue
But weepeþ so for wantyng of hir wille
Til þat hire teeres in þe lystes fille 
Sche seyde I am aschamed douteles
Saturnus seyde doughter hold þi pees
Mars haþ his wille his knight hath all his boone
And by myn heed þou schalt ben eesed soone
The trompoures wiþ þe lowde menstralcye
The heraudes þat ful lowde yelle and crye
Ben in here wele for ioye of daun Arcite
But herkneþ me and stynteþ noyse alite
Which a miracle þer bifel anon
This fiers Arcite haþ of his helm ydoon
And on a courser for to schewe his face
He prikeþ endelong þe large place


lokyng vpward vpon þis Emelye
And sche again him caste a frendlich yhe
ffor wommen as to speken in comune
Thei folwen all þe fauour of fortune
And was al his chier as in his herde
Out of þe ground a fir Infernal sterte
ffrom pluto sent atte request of Saturne
ffor which his hors for feere gan to turne
And leep a syde and foundred as he leep
And ar þat arcite may taken keep
he plight him on þe pomel of his heede
That in þe place he lay as he were deede
His brest tobrosten with his sadel bowe
As blak he lay as any cole or crowe
So was þe blood yronne in his face
Anon he was born out of þe place
Wiþ herte soor to Theseus paleys
Tho was he coruen out of his harneys
And in a bed Ibrought ful fair and blyue
ffor he was yet in memorie and a lyue   
And alwey cryeng after Emelye
Duc Theseus with all his companye
Is comen hom to Athenes his Citee
With alle blisse and gret solempnete
Al be it þat þis auenture was falle
he nolde not disconforten hem alle
Men seyde eek þat arcite schal not dye
he schal ben heled of his maladye
And of anoþer þing þei were as fayn
That of hem alle was þer non yslayn
Alle were þei sore hurt and namely oon
That with a spere was þerled his brest boon
To oþer woundes and to broken armes
Some hadden salue and some hadden charmes
ffermacies of herbes and eek saue
Thei dronke for þei wolde here lyues haue


ffor which þis noble Duc as he wel can
Conforteþ and honoureþ euery man
And makeþ reuel al þe lange night
vnto þe straunge lordes as it was right
Ne þer was holden no disconfytyng
But as a Iustnes or a torneying
ffor soþly þer was no disconfiture
ffor fallyng nys but an auenture
Ne to be ladde by force to þe stake
vnyolden and with twenty knightes take
A persone alone wiþouten mo
And haried forþ by arme foot and too
And eek his steede driuen forþ wiþ staues
Wiþ foot men boþe yomen and knaues
It was arretted him no vilanye
Ther may no man clepe it Cowardie
ffor which anon Duk Theseus leet crie
To stynte alle rancour and enuye
The gree as wel of oo syde as of oþer
And eiþer side ylik as oþer broþer  
And yaf hem ȝiftes after here degre
and fully heeld he feste dayes þre
And conueyed þe kynges worþily
Out of his toun a iorney largely
And hom went euery man þe righte way
Ther was namore but far wel and haue good day
Of þis bataille I wol no more endite
But speke of Palamon and  arcite
 Swelleþ þe brest of Arcite and þe sore
Encreceþ at his herte more and more
The cloþred blood for eny lechecraft
Corupteþ and is in his bouk Ilaft
Thaf neyþer veyne blood ne ventusynge
Ne drynk of herbes may ben his helpynge
The vertue expulsif or animal
ffro þilke vertu cleped natural


Ne may þe venym voide ne expelle
The pipes of his longes gan to swelle
And euery lacerte in his brest adoun
Is schent with venym and corrupcioun
Him gayneþ neyþer for to gete his lijf
vomyt vpward ne dounward laxatif
Al is tobrusten þilke region
Nature haþ no dominacion
And certeynly þer nature wil not werche
ffare wel phisik go bere þe man to cherche 
This al and som þat arcita mot dye
ffor which he sendeth after Emelye
And Palamon þat was his cousyn deere
Than seyde he þus as ȝe schal after heere
 Nat may þe woful spirit in myn herte
Declare a poynt of alle my sorwes smerte
To you my lady þat I loue moost
But I biqueþe þe seruice of my gost
To yow abouen euery creature 
Syn þat my lijf may no lenger dure  
Allas þe woo allas þe peynes stronge 
That I for ȝou haue suffred and so longe 
Allas þe deth allas myn Emelye
Allas departyng of oure companye
Allas myn hertes queene allas my lyf
Myn hertes lady endere of my lif
What is þis world what axed men to haue
Now with with his loue now in his colde graue
Allone wiþouten eny companye
ffarwel my sweete foo myn Emelye
And softe take me in ȝoure armes tweye
ffor loue of god and herkneþ what I seye
 I haue here with my cosyn Palamon
Hadde strif and rancour many a day agon
ffor loue of yow and for my Ialousye
And Iuppiter so wis my soule gye


To speken of a seruant propurly
With circumstances alle trewely
That is to sein trouþe honour and knighthede
Wisdom humblesse estat and heigh kynrede
ffredom and al þat longeþ to þat art
So Iuppiter haue of my soule parte
As in þis worlde right now knowe I non
So worþi to be loued as Palamon
That serueþ yow and wil don all his lijf
And if þat euere ȝe schal be a wijf
fforyete nat Palamon the gentilman
And with þat word his speche faile gan
ffor from his feet vnto his brest was come
The colde of deþ þat hadde him ouercome 
And yet more ouer for in his armes tuo
The vital strengþe is lost and all ago
Oonly þe intellecte wiþoute more
That dwelled in his herte sik and sore 
Gan faillen whan þe herte felte deþ
Busked his yhen tuo and failed breþ  
But on his lady ȝet cast he his yhe
His laste word was mercy Emelye
his spirit changed hous and wente þere
As I cam neuer I can nought telle where
Therfore I stynte I am no dyuinistre
Of soules fynde I nat in þat registre
Ne me ne list þilke opinions to telle
Of hem þough þat þey writen wher þei duelle
Arcite is cold þat mars his soule gye
Now wol I speke forth of Emelye
Schrighte Emelye and houleþ Palamon
And Theseus his suster took anoon
Swounyng and bar hire fro þe cors away
What helpeþ it to tarien forþ þe day
To tellen how sche weepe boþe eue and morwe
ffor in such caas wommen haue such sorwe


Whan þat here housbondes ben fro hem ago
That for þe more part þei sorwen so
Or elles fallen in swich a maladye
That atte laste certeinly þey dye
Infinite ben þe sorwes and þe teeres
Of olde folk And folk of tendre ȝeeres
In all þe toun for deþ of þis Teban
ffor him þer weepeþ boþe child and man
So gret weepynge was þer non certayn
Whan Ector was brought al fressh yslayn
To Troye allas the pite þat was þere
Cracching of cheekes rendyng eek of here
Whi woldestow ben deed þis wommen crye
And haddest gold ynough and Emelye
No man mighte gladen Theseus
Sauyng his olde fader Egeus
That knew þis worldes transmutacioun
As he hadde seyn it vp and doun
Ioye after woo and woo after gladnesse
And scheweth hem ensample and liknesse  
Right as þer dede neuer man quod he
That he ne lyued in erþe in som degree 
Right so þer lyuede neuere man he seyde
In al þis world þat som tyme he ne deyde
This world is not but a þurghfare ful of wo
And we ben pilgrimes passyng to and fro
Deþ is an ende of euery worldly sore
And ouer al þis ȝet seide he mochel more
To þis effect ful wisly to enhorte
The poeple þat þei schulde him reconforte
Duc Theseus with all his busy cure
Cast now wher þat þe Sepulture
Of good arcite may best ymaked be
And eek most honorable in his degre
And at þe last he took conclusion
That þer as ferst arcite and Palamon


hadde for loue þe bataille hem bitweene
That in þe selue groue swete and greene
Ther as he hadde his amorous desires
his compleynt and for loue his hoote fyres
he wolde make a fyr in which þe office
ffuneral he mighte hem all complice
he leet anon comande to hakke and hewe
The ookes olde and leyen hem on a rewe
In culpons wel arrayed for to brenne
his officers with swifte foot þey renne
And Ride anon at his comandement
And after þis Theseus haþ ysent
After a beere and it al ouerspradde
Wiþ cloþ of gold þe richest þat he hadde
And of þe same suyte he cladde arcite
vpon his hondes his gloues white
Ek on his heed a croune of laurer greene
And in his hond a swerd  bright and keene
he leyde him bare þe visage on þe beere
Ther with he weep that pite was to heere  
And for þe pepul scholde seen him alle
Whan it was day he brought him in to þe halle
That roreþ of þe crye and þe soun
 Tho com þis woful Theban Palamon
With flotery berd and ruggy asschy heeres
In cloþes blak ydropped al with teeres
And passyng oþer of weepyng Emelye
The reufullest of all þis companye
In as moche as þe seruice scholde bee
The more noble and riche in his degree
Duc Theseus leet for þre steedes bringe
That trapped were in steel al gliterynge
And couered with þe armes of daun arcite
vpon þese steedes greete and white
Ther seten folk of which on bar his scheeld
Anoþer his spere vpon his hondes heelde


The þridde bar with him his bowe turkeys
Of brent gold was þe caas and eek þe harneys
And ryden forþ a paas with sorwful cheere
Toward þe groue as ȝe schul after heere
The noblest of þe Greekes þat þer were
vpon here schuldres carieden þe beere
With slake paas and eighen reede and wete
Þurghout þe Cite by þe maistre streete 
That sprad was al with blak and wonder highe
Right of þe same is þe same is þe street ywrye
vpon þe right hond went olde Egeus
And on þat other syde duk Theseus
With vessels in here hand of gold ful fyne
As ful of hony melk and blood and wyne
Ek Palaman with ful gret companye
And after þat com woful Emelye
With fire in honde as was þat tyme þe gyse
To do þoffice of funeral seruise
Heigh labour and ful gret apparaillyng
Was atte seruise and þe fir makyng  
That wiþ his greene top þe heuene raughte
And twenty fadme of brede þe armes straughte 
This is to sein þe bowes were so brode
Of stree first þer was leyd many a loode
But how þe fir was maked vp on heighte
Ne eek þe names how þe trees highte
As Ok fir birch asp Alder holm popeler
Willow Elm plane Assh box chesteyn lynde laurer
Mapel þorn beech hasill ew whipiltre
how þey were felde schal not be told for me
Ne how þe goddes ronnen vp and doun
Disherited of here habitacioun
In which þei woneden in reste and pees
Nymphes ffawnes and amadries 
Ne how þe beestes and þe briddes alle
ffledden for feered whan þe woode was falle 


Ne how þe ground agast was of þe light
That was not wont to see þe sonne bright
Ne how þe fyr was couched first with stree 
And þanne with drye stockes clouen a þre
And þanne with greene woode and spicerie
And þanne with cloth of gold and wiþ Perrye
And garlandes hangyng with ful many a flour
The mirre þencens with al so sweete odour
Ne how arcite lay among al þis
Ne what richesse aboute his body is
Ne how þat Emelye as was þe gyse
Putte in þe fyre of funeral seruise 
Ne how sche swounede whan maad was þe fire
Ne what sche spak ne what was hire desire
Ne what Iuwels men in þe fyre cast
Whan þat þe fyr was greet and brende fast
Ne how som cast hir scheeld and som hire spere
And of here vestimentz whiche þat þey were
And coppes full of melk and wyn and blood
Into þe fyr þat brente as it were wood  
Ne how þe Grekes with an huge route
Thries ryden al þe fir aboute
vpon þe left hond with a bowe schotynge
And þries with here speres claterynge
And þries how þe ladyes gon to crye
Ne how þat lad was homward Emelye
Ne how arcite is brent to aisshes colde
Ne how þat lichewake was yholde
Al þilke nyght ne how þe greekes play
The wakepleyes ne kepe I nought to say
Who wrasteleþ best naked with oyle anoynt
Ne who þat bar him best in no disioynt
I wol not tellen alle how þey goon
hom til athenes whan þe play was don
But schortly to þe poynt þan wol I wende
And maken of my longe tale an ende


 By proces and of lengthe of certeyn ȝeeres
Al stynt is þe mournyng and þe teeres
Of grekes by on general assent
Than semede þer was a parlement
At atthenes vpon a certein point and caas
Among þe whiche poyntes yspoken was
To haue with certain contrees alliance
And haue fully of Thebane obeissance
ffor which þis noble Theseus anon
leet seende after gentil Palamon
vnwist of him what was þe cause and why
But in his blake cloþes sorwfully
he com at his comandement in hye
Tho sente Theseus for Emelye
Whan þey were sette and huyst was in þe place 
An Theseus abyden haþ a space
Or eny word com fro his wise breste
his eyȝen sette he þer as was his leste 
And with a sad visage he siked stille 
And after þat right þus he seyde his wille  
The ferste maner of þe cause aboue
Whan he ferst maade þe faire cheine of loue
Gret was þeffect and heigh was his entente
Wel wist he why and what þer of he mente
ffor with þat faire cheyne of loue he bonde
The fyr þe aier the water and þe londe
In certeyn boundes þat þei may not flee 
That same prince and þat same mouer quod he
haþ stablissed in þis wrecchede world adoun
Certeine daies and dominacioun
To all þat beþ engendred in þis place
Ouer þe whiche day þay may not pace
Alle mowe þey yet þo dayes abregge
Ther needeþ nought non auctorite to legge
ffor it is proeued by experience
But þat me list to declaren my sentence 


Than may men wel by þis ordre discerne
That þilke mouere stable is and eterne
Wel may men knowe but it be a foole
That euery partie darreyned from his hoole
ffor nature haþ nat taken his bygynnyng
Of no partye nor of cantel of a þing
But of a þing þat parfyt is and stable
Descendyng so til it be corumpable
And þerfore for his wise purueance
he haþ so wel byset his ordinance
That specie of þinges and progressions
Schullen endure by successions
And nought eterne wiþouten any lye
This maystow vnderstonden and seen at yhe
Loo þe Ok þat haþ so long a norshing
ffro þe tyme þat it first bygynneþ to spring
And hath so long a lijf as ȝe may see
Yet atte laste wasted is þe tree 
Considereþ eek how þat þe harde ston
vnder oure foot on which we trede and goon  
Yet wasteþ it as it liþ by þe weye
The brode ryuer som tyme wexeþ dreye
The grete townes see we wane and wende
Þan ȝe see þat all þis þing haþ ende
Of man and woman se we wel also
That needeth in oon of þe termes tuo
That is to sein in ȝouþe or elles age
He moot be deed þe king as schal þe page
Sum in his bedd som in þe deepe see
Som in the large feeld as ȝe may see 
Ther helpeþ nought al goþ þat ilke weye
Than may I sein that al þis þing moot deye
What maketh þis but Iuppiter þe king
That is Prince and cause of alle þing
Conuertyng alle vnto his propre wille
ffrom which it is darreyned soþ to tille


And heer agayns no creature on lyue
Of no degree auailleþ for to stryue
Thanne is it wisdom as it þenkeþ me
To make vertue of necessite 
And take it wel þat we may not eschewe
And nameliche þat to vs alle is dewe
    
And rebell is to him þat all may gye
And certeinly a man haþ most honour
To deyen in his excellence and flour
Whan he is siker of his goode name
Than haþ he doon his freendes ne him no schame
And gladder oughte his frendes ben of his deþ
Whan wiþ honour yyolden is vp þe breþ
Than whan his name apalled is for age
ffor al forgeten is his vessellage
Than is the beste as for a worþy fame
To deyen whan he is best of name
The contrarie of alle þis is wilfulnesse
Why grucchen we why haue we heuynesse
That goode Arcite of Chiuallerie þe flour  
Departed is wiþ duete and with honour
Out of þis foule prison of þis lyf
Why gruccheþ heere his cosyn and his wyf
Of his welfare þat loueþ him so wel
Kan he hem þank nay god woot neuer a deel
That boþen his soule and eek him offende 
And yet þei mowe her lustes nought amende
What may conclude of þis longe serie
But after wo I rede vs to be merye
And þanken Iupiter of all his grace
And er we departen from þis place
I rede we make of oure sorwes tuo
O parfyt ioye lastyng euer mo
And lokeþ now where most sorwe is Inne
Ther wol I ferst amenden and bygynne


Suster quod he þis is my ful assent
Wiþ all þauys heere of my parlement 
That gentil Palamon ȝoure oughne knight
That serueth ȝou with wille and herte and might 
And euer haþ don siþen ye ferst him knewe
That ȝe schull of ȝour grace vpon him rewe
And taken him for housbond and for lord
Lene me your hond for þis is oure acord
Lat see now of your wommanly pite
he is a kinges broþer sone parde
And þough he were a pore Bachiller
Syn he haþ serued you so many a yeer
And had for ȝou so gret aduersite 
It moste ben considered leeueþ me
ffor gentil mercy oughte to passen right
Than seide he þus to Palamon þe knight
I trowe þer needeþ litel sermonyng
To make you assented to þis þing
Come nere and take ȝoure lady by þe hond
Bitwixen hem was maad anon þe bond
That highte matrimoigne or mariage  
By all þe counsail and þe baronage
And þus wiþ alle blisse and melodye
Haþ Palamon ywedded Emelye
And god þat al þis world haþ wrought
Sende him his loue þat haþ it deere bought
ffor now is Palamon in alle wele
Lyuyng in blisse in richesse and in hele
And Emely him loueth so tendrely
And he hir serueþ so gentilly
That was þer no word hem betweene 
Of Ialousie or ony oþer teene
Thus endeth Palamon and Emelye 
And god saue all þis faire companye

Whan þat þe knight had þus his tale ytold
In all þe companye nas þer ȝong ne old
That he ne seyde it  was a noble storye
And worþi for to drawen in memorie
And nameliche þe gentils euerych oon
Oure Oost lough and swor so mot I gon
This goþ aright vnbokeled is þe male
lat se now who schal telle anoþer tale
ffor trewely þe game is wel bygonne
Now telleþ ȝe sire monk if ȝe kunne
Somwhat to quyte with þe knightes tale
The meller þat fordrunken was al pale
So þat vnneþe vpon his hors he sat
he nolde aualen neyþer hood ne hat
Ne abide noman for his curtesie
But in Pilates vois he gan to crye
And swor by armes and by blood and bones
I can a noble tale for þe nones
Wiþ which I wol now quite þe knightes tale
Oure oost saugh þat he was drunken of ale
And seyde abyde Robyn leeue broþer
Som bettre man schal telle vs ferst anoþer  
Abyd and lat vs werken þriftily
By goddes soule quod he þat wol nat I
ffor I wol speken or elles go my weye
Oure oost answerde telle on a deuelleweye
Thou art a fool þi witte is ouercome
Now herkneþ quoþ þe meller alle and some
But first I make a protestacioun
That I am dronke I knowe it by my soun
And þerfore if I speke or mys say
Wite ȝe it þe ale of Suthwerk I ȝou pray


ffor I wol telle a legende and a lyf
Boþe of a Carpenter and of his wijf 
how þat a clerk haþ sett þe wrightes cappe
The Reeue answerde and seyde stynt þy clappe
lat be þi lewed dronken harlotrie
It is a synne and eeke gret folye
To apeiren eny man or diffame
And eek to bringe wyfes in such fame
Thou maist ynough of oþer þinges sain
This dronken meller spak ful soone agayn
And seyde leeue broþer Osewold 
Who has no wyf he is no Cokewold
But I seye nought þerfore þat þou art oon
Ther been ful goode wyfes many on
    
    
Why art þou angry wiþ my tale now
I haue a wif parde as wel as þou
Yet nolde I not for þe Oxen in my plough
Take vpon me more þan ynough
As demen on my self þat I were oon
I wil bileeue þat I am noon
And housbonde schal not ben Inquysitif
Of goddes priuetees ne of his wijf
So he may fynde goddes foyson þere
Of þe remenant needeþ nought to enquere
What scholde I more sayn but þis Mellere
he nolde his wordes for no man forbere  
But tolde his cherles tale in his manere
Me aþinkeþ þat I schal reherce hem heere
And þerfore euery gentil wight I preye
Demeþ nought for goddes loue þat I seye
Of yuel entent but for þat I moot reherse
Here tales alle be þei bettre or worse
Or elles falsen som of my matiere
And þerfore who so list it nought to heere


Torne ouer þe leef and chees anoþer tale
ffor ȝe schulle fynde ynowe grete and smale
Of storial þing þat toucheþ gentilesse
And eek moralite and holynesse
Blameþ not me if þat ȝe cheese amys
The meller is a cherl ȝe knowe wel þis
So was þe Reeue eek and oþer mo
And harlotrie þey tolden boþe tuo
Auiseþ ȝou and putteþ me out of blame
And eek men schal not make ernest of game
Whilom þer was dwellyng at Oxenfoord
A Riche gnoffe þat gestes heeld to boorde
And of his crafte he was a Carpunter
Wiþ him þer was dwellyng a pouer scoler
hadde lerned art but all his fantasye
Was torned for to lerne astrologie
And couþe a certein of conclusions
To demen by interrogacions
If þat men axed him in certeyn houres
Whan men schuld haue drought or elles schoures
Or if men axed him what schal bifalle
Of euery þing I may nought reknen alle
This clerk was cleped heende Nicholas
Of derne loue he couþe and of Solas
And þerto he was sleigh and ful priue
And like a mayde meeke for to see
A chambre hadde he in þat hostellerie
Allone wiþouten eny companye  
fful fetisly dight wiþ herbes soote
And he himself as sweete as is þe roote
Of licoris or any Settewale
his almagist and bokes grete and smale
his astrelabre longyng for his art
his augrym stones layen faire a part
On schelfes couched at his beddes heede
His presse ycouered with a faldyng reed
And al aboute þer lay a gay sautrie
On which he made a night melodye
So swetly þat alle þe chambre ronge
And angelus ad virginem he songe
And after þat he song þe kinges note
fful ofte blessed was his merie þrote


And þus þe sweete clerk his tyme spente
After his freendes fyndyng and his rente
This Carpunter hadde wedded a newe wyf
Which þat he louede more þan his lyf
Of xviij ȝeer sche was of age
Ialous he was and heeld hir narwe in cage
ffor sche was wylde and ȝong and he was old
And demed him self ben lik a Cokewold
he knew not Caton for his witte was rude
That bad men wedde his similitude
Men scholde wedde after here astat
ffor youþe and eelde is often in debat
But siþen þat he was fallen in the snare
He most endure as oþer folk his care
ffair was þis ȝonge wijf and þer wiþ al
As eny wesele hire body gent and smal
A ceynt sche wered barred al of self
A barmcloþ as whit as morne melk
Vpon hire lendes ful of many a goore
Whit was hir smok and brouded al bifore
And eek byhynde on hire coler aboute
Of kolblak silk wiþinne and eek wiþoute  
The tapes of hir white voluper
Were of þe same suyte of hire coler
hire filet brood of silk and sitt ful hye
and sikerly sche hadde a likerous yhe
fful smal ypulled were hire browes tuo
And þo were bent and blak as any slo
Sche was ful more blisful for to see
Than is þe newe perionette tree
And softer þan þe wolle is of a weþer
And by hir gerdul hinge a purs of leþer
Tassed wiþ selk and perled wiþ latoun
In al þis world to seeken vp and doun
Ther is no man so wys þat couþe þenche
So gay a popelote or swich a wenche


fful brighter was þe schynyng of hir hewe
Than in þe tour þe noble yforged newe
But of hir song it was so lowd and ȝerne
As any swalwe chitering on a berne
Therto sche couþe skippe and make a game
As ony kyde or calf folwyng his dame
hir mouþ was sweete as braket or þe meth
Or hoord of appeles layd in hay or heth
Wynsyng sche was as is a Ioly colt
long as a mast and vpright as a bolt
A broche sche bar on hir loue coler
As brood as is þe boos of a bocler
hire schos were laced on hire legges hye
Sche was a primerole a pygges nye
ffor eny lord to liggen in his bedde
Or ȝet for eny good yeman to wedde
 Now sire and eft sire so bifel þe caas
That on a day þis heende Nicholas
ffil wiþ þis ȝonge wijf to rage and playe
Whil þat hir housbonde was at Osenaye
As clerkes ben ful subtil and ful queinte
And priuely he caught hir by þe queynte  
And seyde I wis but if ich haue my wille
ffor derne loue of þe lemman I spille
And held hir harde by þe haunche bones
And seyde lemman loue me wel al at ones
Or I wol deyen al so god me saue
And sche sprong as a cold doþ in þe traue
And with hir hed sche wried faste awey
Sche seide I wil nat kisse þe by my fey
Whi labbe quod ich labbe Nicholas
Or I wol crie out harrow and allas
Do wey ȝoure hondes for ȝoure curtesye
This Nicholas gan mercy for to crie
And spak so faire and profred him so fast
That sche hir loue graunted him atte last


And swor hir oþ by sent Thomas of kent
That sche wolde ben at his comaundement
Whan þat sche may hir leysir wel aspye
Myn housbonde is so ful of Ialousye
That but I wayte wel and be priue
I woot right wel I nam but deed quoþ sche
Ye moote ben ful derne as in þis caas
Nay þerof kare ȝe nought quod Nicholas
A clerk hadde litherly biset his while
But if he couþe a carpunter begile
And þus þey ben acorded and ysworn
To wayte a tyme as I haue told biforn
Whan Nicholas hadde þis euerydel
And thakked hire aboute þe lendes wel
he kist hir sweete and takþ his Sauterie
And playeþ faste and makeþ melodye
Than fil it þus þat to þe parissche cherche
Cristes owne werkes for to werche
This goode wijf wente on an haly day
hir forhed schon as bright as any day
So was it waissche whan sche leet hir werk
Now was þer of þat chirche a parissche clerk  
The which þat was ycleped absolon
Crul was his heer and as þe gold it schon
And strouted as a fanne large and brode
fful streyte and euene lay his Ioly schode
his rode was reed his eyhen gray as goos
Wiþ poules wyndow coruen in his schoos
In hoses rede he wente fetisly
Iclad he was ful smal and propurly
Al in a kertell al of light waget
fful faire an þikke ben þe poyntz ysett
And þer vpon he hadde a gay surplys
As whit as is þe blosme on þe Rys
A merie child he was so god me saue
Wel couþe he laten blood or clippe or schaue


And make a charter of lond or an aquitance
In twenty maner couþe he trippe and daunce
After þe scole of Oxenforde þo
And wiþ his legges casten to and fro
And playen songes on a smal rubible
Therto he song som tyme a lowde quynyble
And as wel couþe he pleye on a giterne
In all þe toun nas brewhous ne tauerne
That he ne visited wiþ his solas
Ther any gaillard tappestere was
But soth to sein he was somdel squaymous
Of fartyng and of speche daungerous
 This absolon þat Ioly was and gay
Goþ with a censer on þe haly day
Sensyng þe wyfes of þe parische fast
And many a louely look on hem he cast
And namely on þis carpunteres wyf
To loke on hire him þought a mery lijf
Sche was so proper and swete and swete and licorous
I dar wel sein if sche hadde ben a mous
And he a catte he wolde hire hente anoon
This parissche clerk þis ioly absolon  
haþ in his herte such a loue longynge
That of no wijf took he non offrynge
ffor curtesie he seide he wolde non
The moone whan it was night ful brighte schon
And Absolon his giterne haþ Itake
ffor paramoure he þoughte for to wake
And forþ he goþ iolyf and amorous
Til he com to þe carpunteres hous
A litel after cokkes had ycrowe
And dressed him vp by a schot wyndowe
Thas was vpon þe carpenteres walle
he syngeþ in his voys gentil and smalle
Now dere lady if þi willes be
I prey yow þat ȝe wil Rewe on me


ffol wel acordant to his giternyng
This Carpenter awok and herde him syng
And spak vnto his wijf and seyde anoon
What Alison heris þou not absolon
That chaunteþ þus vnder oure boures walle
And sche answerde hir housbonde þer wiþ alle
Yis god woot Iohan I here it euery del
This passeþ forþ what wile ȝe bet þan wel
ffro day to day þis ioly Absolon
So woweþ hire þat him is woo bigon
he wakeþ al þe night and al þe day
he kembede his lokkes brode and made hem gay
he woweþ hire by menes and brocage
And swore he wolde ben hir oughne page
he syngeþ brokking as a nightyngale
he sente hire pyment meth and spiced ale
And wafres pypyng hoot out of þe gleede
And for sche was of town he profred meede
ffor somme folk wol be wonnen for richesse
And somme for strokes and somme for gentilnesse
Som tyme to schewe his lightnesse and maystrie
he pleieth heraudes vpon a scaffold hye  
But what auayleþ him as in þis caas
Sche loueþ so þis heende Nicholas
That Absolon may blowe þe buckes horn
he ne haþ for his labour but a skorn
And þus sche makeþ absolon here ape
And all his Ernest turneþ till a Iape
ffor soþ is þis prouerbe it is no lye
Men sein right þus alwey þey neighe slye
makeþ þe ferre leef to be loth
ffor þough þat absolon be wood or wroþ
By cause þat he fer was from hire sight
þis neigh Nicholas stood in his light
 Now bere ye wel heende Nicholas
ffor absolon may waille and synge allas


And so bifell it on a Saturday
This Carpunter was gon to Osenay
And heende Nicholas and alison
Acorded be to þis Conclusion
That Nicholas schal schapen hem a wile
This seely Ialous housbonde to bygyle
And if so be þe game wente aright
Sche scholde slepen in his arm al nyght
ffor þis was his desyr and hire also
And right anon wiþouten wordes mo
This Nicholas no lenger wolde tarie
But doþ ful softe vnto his chambre carie
Boþe mete and drynke for a day or tweye
And to hire housbonde bad hir for to seye
If þat he axed after Nicholas
Sche scholde say sche nyste wher he was
Of al þat day sche seigh him nought wiþ eye
Sche trowed þat he was in maladye
ffor for no cry hir mayde couþe him calle
he nolde answere for noþing þat mighte falle
This passeþ forþ al þilke Saturday
That Nicholas stille in his Chambre lay  
And eet or sleep or dede what him liste
Til Sonday þat þe sonne goþ to reste
This sely carpunter haþ gret meruayle
Of Nicholas or what þing might him ayle
And sayde I am adrad by seint Thomas
It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas
God schilde þat he deide sodeinly
This world is now ful tykell sikerly
I seigh to day a cors yborn to cherche
That now a monday last I saugh him werche
Go vp quod he vnto his knaue anon
Clepe at his dore or knocke with a stoon
loke how it is and telle me boldely
This knaue goþ him vp ful sturdily


And at þe chambre dore whil þat he stood
he criede and knokkede as þat he were wood
What how what do ȝe mayster Nicholay
how may ȝe sleepen al þe longe day
But al for nought he herde nought a word
An hole he fond ful lough vpon a bord
Ther as þe catte was wont in for to creepe
And at þat hole he loked in ful deepe
And atte last he hadde of him a sight
This nicholas sat euer capyng vpright
As he hadde keked on þe newe moone
And doun he goþ and tolde his mayster soone
In what array he saugh þis ilke man
This Carpunter to blessen him bigan
And seyde help vs seinte ffredeswide
A man woot litel what him schal betyde
This man is falle with his astronomie
In som woodnesse or in som agonye
I þought ay wel how þat it scholde be
Men scholde not knowe of goddes priuite
Ȝe blessed be alwey a lewed man
That nought but oonly his bileeue can  
So ferd anoþer clerk with astronomie
he walked in þe feeldes for to prie
vppon þe sterres what þer schulde bifalle
Til he was in a Marle pit yfalle
he saugh nought þat but ȝit by seint Thomas
Me reweth sore of heende Nicholas
he schal be rated of his studyyng
If þat I may by Ihesu heuene king
Gete me a staf þat I may vnderspore
Whil þat þou Robyn heuest vp þe dore
he schal out of his studying as I gesse
And to þe chambre dore he gan him dresse
his knaue was a strong carl for þe nones
And by þe hasp he heef it  of at oones


In to þe floor þe dore fill anon
This Nicholas sat ay as stille as stoon
And euere capede vpward in to the ayre
This Carpunter wende he were in despaire
And hent him by þe schuldres mightyly
And schook him harde and cryed spitously
What Nicholas what how looke a doun
Awake and þenk on cristes passioun
I crouche þe from Elues and fro wightes
Therwiþ þe night spell seyde he anon rightes
Of foure halues of þe hous aboute
And on þe þresschefold on þe dore wiþoute
Ihesu crist and seynt Benedight
Blesse þis hous from euery wikkede wight
ffor þe nightes verye þe white Pate noster
Where wentestow þou seinte peteris suster
And atte laste þis heende Nicholas
Gan for to sike sore and seyde allas
Schal al þe werld be lost eft sones now
This Carpenter answerde what seist þou
What þink on god as we doon men þat swynke
This nicholas answerde feche me drynke  
And after wol I speke in priuitee
Of certein þing þat toucheþ þe and me
I wil telle it non oþer man certeyn
This Carpenter goþ doun and comeþ agein
And brought of mighty ale a large quart
And whan þat ech of hem hadde dronken his part
This Nicholas his dore faste schette
And doun þe Carpunter by him he sette
And seyde Iohn myn hooste leef and deere
Thou schalt vpon my trouþe swere me heere
That to no wight þou schalt þis counseil wreye
ffor it is cristes counseill þat I seie
And if þou telle it man þou art forlore
ffor þis vengance þou schalt haue þerfore


That if þou wreie me þou schalt be wood
 Nay crist forbede it for his holy blood
Quod þo þis sely man I nam no labbe
Ne þough I seie I nam not leef to gabbe
Sey what þou wolt I schal it neuer telle
To child ne wijf by him þat hariede helle
Now Iohan quod Nicholas I wil nouȝt lye
I haue Ifounde in myn astrologie
As I haue loked in þe moone bright
That now a monday next at quarter night
Schal falle a Rayn and þat so wilde and wood
That half so gret was neuer Nowels flood
This world he seide in lasse þan in an hour
Schal al be dreynt so hidous is þe schour
Thus schal mankynde drenche and leese here lif
This Carpunter answerde allas my wijf
And schal sche drenche allas myn alisoun
ffor sorwe of þis he fell almost a doun
And seyde is þer no remedye in þis caas
Whi ȝis for gode quod heende Nicholas
If þou wolt worchen after lore and red
Thou mayst noȝt werken after þin oughne heed  
ffor þus seiþ Salamon þat was ful trewe
Work all by counseill and þou schalt nought rewe
And if þou worken wolt by good counseille
I vndertake wiþoute mast or seile
Yet schal I saue hire and þe and me
hast þou nought herde how saued was Noe
Whan þat owre lord haþ warned him biforn
That all þe world with water schulde be lorn
Ȝis quod þis Carponter ful ȝore ago
hastow not herd quod Nicholas also
The sorwe of Noe wiþ his felaschipe
Or þat he mighte gete his wif to schipe
him hadde leuer I dar wel vndertake
At þilke tyme þan all his weþeres blake


That sche hadde a schip hir self allon
And þerfore wost þou what is best to doon
This axeþ haste and of an hastyf þing
Men may nought preche or make tarying
Anon go gete vs faste in to þis Inne
A knedyng trough or elles a kemelynne
ffor ech of vs but look þat þey ben large
In which men mowe swymme as in a barge
And han þer vitailles suffisaunt
But for a day fy on þe remenaunt
The water schal aslake and gon a way
Aboute prime vpon þe nexte day
But Robyn may not wite of þis þi knaue
Ne eek þy mayde gylle I may nought saue
Axe nought why for þough þou axe me
I wol nought tellen goddes priuite
Sufficeþ þe but if þi wittes madde
To haue as gret a grace as noe hadde
Thi wif schal I wel sauen out of doute
Go now þi wey and speed þe heer aboute
But when þou hast for hire and þe and me
Ygeten vs þese knedyng tubbes þre  
Than schalt þou hang hem in þe rof ful hye
That noman of oure purueance espye
And whan þou þus hast don as I haue seyd
And hast oure vitailes faire in hem yleyde
And eek an ax to smyte þe corde a tuo
Whan þat þe water comeþ þat we may go
And broke an hole an heigh vpon þe gable
vnto þe gardeynward ouer þe stable
That we may freely passen forþ oure wey
Whan þat þe grete schour is gon a wey
Thanne schalt þou swymme as mery I vndertake
As doþ þe white doke after his drake
Than wol I clepe how alison how Ioon
Be merie for þe flood wol passe anon


And þou wolt sein haill maister Nicholay
Goode morwen I see þe wel for it is day
And þanne schal we be lordes all oure lif
Of alle þe world as Noe and his wijf
But þat of oo þing I warne þe ful right
Be wel auysed on þat ilke night
That we ben entred in to þe schippes boord
That noon of vs ne speke nought a word
Ne clepe ne crye but been in his preyere
ffor it is goddes oughne heeste deere
Thy wijf and þou mot hange fer atwynne
ffor þat betwixe ȝou schal be no synne
No more in lokyng þan þer schal in dede
This ordinance is seid go god þe speede
To morwe at night whan men ben all on sleepe
In to our knedyn tubbes wil we creepe
And sitten þer abidyng goddes grace
Go now þy wey I haue no lenger space
To make of þis no lenger sermonyng
Men sein þus sende þe wise and sey no þing

Go saue oure lijf and þat I þe beseche  
 This seely Carpunter goþ forþ his wey
fful ofte he seyde allas and weylawey
And to his wijf he tolde his priuitee
And sche was warr and knew it bet þan he
What al þis queynte cast was for to seye
But naþeles sche ferde as sche wolde deye
And seyde allas go forþ þi weie anon
help vs to scape or we ben deede echon
I am þi trewe verray wedded wijf
Go deere spouse and help to saue oure lijf
 lo which a gret þing is affection
Men may dye of ymaginacion
So deepe may impressions be take
This seely Carponter bygynneþ quake


him þenketh verraily þat he may se
Noe flood come walkyng as þe see
To drenchen alison his hony deere
he weepeþ wailleþ maketh sory cheere
he sykeþ wiþ ful many a sory swogh
And goþ and geteþ him a knedyng trough
And after a tubbe and a kemelyn
And priuily he sent hem to his In
And hyng hem in þe roof in priuite
his oughne hond he made eek leddres þre
To clymben by þe ronges and þe stalkes
vnto þe tubbes hangyng in þe balkes
And hem vitailled boþe trough and tubbe
Wiþ bred and cheese and good ale in a Iubbe
Suffisyng right ynough as for a day
But ar þat he hadde maad al þis array
he sent his knaue and eek his wenche also
vpon his neede to london for to go
And on þe monday whan it drough to night

And dressed all þing as it scholde be
And schortly clomben vp all þre  
Thei setten stille wel a forlong way
Now pater noster clum seide Nicholay
And Clum quod Iohn and Clum seide alison
This Carpunter seide his deuocion
And stille he sitte and biddeþ his prayere
Awaityng on the rayn if he it heere
The deth sleepe for wery bysynesse

Aboute corfew tyme or litel more

And eft he routeþ for his heed myslay
Doun of þe laddre stalkeþ Nicholay
And alison ful softe a doun sche spedde
Wiþouten wordes mo þey gon to bedde


Ther as þe carpunter is wont to lye
Ther was þe reuel and þe melodye
And þus lith alison and Nicholas
In busynesse of merþe and of solas
Til þat þe belle of laudes gan to rynge
And the freres in þe chauncell gonne synge
This parische clerk þis amorous absolon
That is for loue alwey so wo bigon
vpon þe monday was at Osenay
With compaignie him to desport and play
And axed vpon caas a cloisterer
fful priuily after Iohn þe Carpunter
And he drough him a part out of þe chirche
And seyde I not I saugh him heere nought werche
Siþþe Saturday I trowe þat he be went
ffor tymber þere oure abbot haþ him sent
ffor he is wont for tymber for to go
And dwelle atte graunge a day or tuo

So mote I þriue I schal at cokkes crowe

That stant ful lowe vpon his boures walle
To alison now wol I tellen alle
My loue longyng for ȝit I schal not misse
That atte laste wey I schal hir kisse
Som maner comfort schal I haue par fay
My mouþ haþ icched al þis longe day
That is a signe of kissyng atte leste
Al night me mette eek I was at a feeste
Therfore I wol go sleepe an our or tweye
And al þe night þan wol I wol I wake and pleye


Whan þat þe ferste cok haþ crowe anon

And him arrayeþ gay and poynt deuyse
But ferst he cheweþ grayn and likorise
To smellen swoote or he hadde kempt his here
vnder his tonge a trewe loue he beere
ffor þerby wende he to be gracious
he rowmeth to þe carpenteres hous
And stille he stant vnder þe schot wyndowe
vnto his brest it raught it was so lowe
And softe he coughed wiþ a semy soun
What do ȝe hony combe swete alisoun
My faire brid my sweete synamome
Awaketh lemman myn and spekeþ to me
We litel þenken ȝe vpon my woo
That for ȝoure loue I swete as I go
No wonder is þough þat I swelte and swete

Iwys lemman I haue such loue longyng
That lik a turtel trewe is my moornyng

Go fro þe wyndow Iakke fool sche sayde  
As help me god it wil not be com pame

Wel bette þan þe by Ihesu absolon
Go forþ þi wey or I wil caste a stoon
And lete me slepe a twenty deuel way

Wolt þou þan go þi way þerwith quod sche

The wyndow sche vndoþ and þat in hast

lest þat our neighebore þe espie
This absolon gan wipe his mouþ ful drye
Derk was þe night as piche or as þe cole
And at the wyndow out sche putte hire hole
And absolon him fil no bet ne wers
But wiþ his mouþ he kiste hire naked ers
fful sauorly er he were war of þis
A bak he stert and þought it was amys
ffor wel he wiste a womman haþ no berd

And sayde fy allas what haue I do
Tehe quod sche and clapt þe wyndow to
And absolon goþ forþ a sory pas
A berde a berd seide heende Nicholas
By goddes corpus þis goth faire and wel
This sely absolon herde it euery del
And on his lippe he gan for anger byte
And to himself he seyde I schal þe quyte  
Who rubbeþ now who froteþ now his lippes
With dust with sond wiþ straw with cloþ wiþ chippes
But absolon þat seith ful ofte allas
My soule bitake I to Saternas
But me were leuere þan al þis toun quod he
Of þis despite awroken for to be
Allas quoþ he allas I ne hadde ybleynt
his hote loue is cold and al yqueynt
ffor fro þat tyme þat he hadde kest hire ers
Of paramours he sette not a kers
ffor he was heled of his maladie
fful ofte paramoures he gan diffie
And weepe as doþ a child þat is ybete
A softe paas he wente ouer þe strete


vntil a Smyth men clepen daun Geruays
That in his forge smythieþ plough harnays
he scharpeþ scharre and Culter bisyly
This absolon knokkeþ al Esely
And sayde vnto Geruays and þat anon
What who art þou it am I absolon
What absolon for cristes swete tree
Why ryse so raþe benedicite
What eyleþ ȝou som gay gerl god it woot
haþ brought ȝou þus vpon þe viritoot
By seinte note ȝe wot wel what I me
This absolon ne roughte nat a bene
Of all his pley no word agayn he gaf
he hadde more tow on his distaf
Than Geruays knew and sayde frend so deere
The hoote Culter in þe Chemenye heere
As lene it me I haue þerwiþ to done
I wol bringe it agayn ful soone
Geruais answerde certes were it gold
Or in a poke nobles all vntold
Thou scholdest haue as I am trewe smith
Ey cristes foo what wol ȝe don þerwith  
Therof quod absolon be as be may
I schal wel telle it þe to morwe day
And caughte þe culter by þe colde stele
fful softe out aþ þe dore he gan to stele
And went vnto þe Carpenteres wal
he koughede ferst and knokkede þer wiþ al
vpon þe wyndow right as he dede ere
This alison answerde who is þere
That knokkeþ as I warant it a þeef
Why nay quod he god woot my sweete leef
I am þin absolon þi dereling
Of gold quod he I haue þe brought a ryng
My moder yaf it me so god me saue
fful fyn it is and þerto wel ygraue


This wol I yiuen þe if þou me kisse
This Nicholas was risen for to pisse
And þought he wolde amenden al þe Iape
he schulde kisse his ers or þat he scape
And vp þe wyndow dide he hastily
And out his ers he putte priuily
Ouer þe buttok to þe haunche bon
And þerwiþ spak þis clerk þis absolon
Spek swete brid I not wher þou art
This Nicholas anon leet flee a fart
As gret as it hadde ben a þonder dent
That wiþ þe strook he was almost yblent
And he was redy wiþ his Iren hoot
And Nicholas in þe ers he smoot
Of goþ þe skyn an hande brood aboute
The hoote culter brenned so his toute
And for þe smerte he wende for to dye
As he were wood for woo he gan to crye
help water water help for goddes herte
This Carpunter out of his slomber sterte
And herde on cryen watir as he were wood
And þought allas now comeþ Noweles flood  
And sette him vppe wiþoute wordes mo
And wiþ an ax he smot þe corde a tuo
And doun goþ al he fond neyþer to selle
No breed nor ale til he com to þe selle
vpon þe floor and þer a swowen he lay
vp sterte hire alison and Nicholay
and cried out and harrow in þe strete
The neigheboures boþe smale and grete
In ronnen for to gauren on þis man
That a swowen lay boþe pale and wan
ffor with þat falle he brosten haþ his arm
But stonde he moste vnto his oughne harm
ffor whan he spak he was anon bore doun
With heende Nicholas and alisoun


They tolden euery man þat he was wood
he was agast so of þe Nowels flood
Thurgh fantasie þat of his vanite
he hadde ybought him knedyng tubbes þre
And hadde hem hanged in þe roof aboue
And þat he preyed him for goddes loue
To sitten in þe roof par companye
The folk gan laughen at his fantasie
And to þe roof þay loken and þei cape
And torned all his harm vnto a Iape
ffor what so þis Carpenter answerde
It was for nought no men his reson herde
With oþes grete he was so sworn a doun
That he was holden wood in all þat toun
ffor euery clerk anon right heeld with oþer
They seyde þe man is wood my leeue broþer
And euery wight gan laughen at his strif
Thus swyued was þe Carpunteres wijf
ffor all his keepyng and his Ialousye
And absolon haþ kist hir neþer yhe
And Nicholas is scalded in his toute
This tale is don and god saue al þe route  
Whan folk han laughen at þis nyce cas
Of absolon and heende Nicholas
Diuerse folk diuersely þey seyde
But for þe more part þei lough and pleyde
Ne at þis tale I saugh noman him greeue
But it were oonly Osewold þe Reeue
By cause he was of Carpenteres craft
A litel Ire is in his herte laft
he gan to grucche and blamen it a lite
So þe ik quod he ful wel couþe I þe quyte
With bleryng of a proud melleres ye
If þat me liste to speke of Ribaudie
But yk am old me list not pley for age
Gras tyme is don my fodder is forage
This white top writeþ myn olde ȝeres
myn herte is also mouled as myn heeres
But if I fare as doþ an open ers
That ilke fruyt is euer lengere þe wers
Til it be roten in mullok or in stree
We olde men I drede so fare we
Til we be roten can we nought be ripe
We hoppen alwey whil þe world wil pipe
ffor in oure wille þer stikeþ euer a naile
To haue an hoor heer and a greene taile
As haþ a leek for þough oure might be gon
Oure wille desireþ folie euer in oon
ffor whan we may nought doon þan wole we speke
yet in oure asschen olde is fyr yreke
ffoure gleedes han we whiche I schal deuyse
Auauntyng lyuyng anger couetyse
This foure sparkes longeþ vnto eelde
Oure olde lymes now wel ben vnwelde


But wil ne schal nat failen þat is soþ
And yet haue I alway a Coltes toþ  
As many a ȝeer as it is passen henne
Syn þat my tappe of lif bygan to renne
ffor sikerly whan I was born anoon
Deþ drough þe tappe of lijf and leet it goon
And euer siþen haþ so þe tappe yronne
Til þat almost al empty is þe tonne
The streem of lijf now droppeþ on þe chimbe
The sely tonge may wel rynge and chymbe
Of wrecchedenesse þat passed is ful yore
With old folk saue dotage is nomore
Whan þat oure oost hadde herde þis sermonyng
he gan to speken as loodly as a king
he seyde what amounteþ all þis witte
What schal we speke alday of holy writte
The deuel maade a reeue for to preche
Or of a Soutere schipman or a leche
Sey forþ þi tale and tarie nought þe tyme
lo deppeford and it is halfwey prime
lo Grenewich þat many a schrewe is Inne
It were al tyme þi tale for to begynne
Now sires quod þis Osewold þe Reeue
I pray you alle þat ye nought ȝou greeue
Thou I answere and somdel sette his houve
ffor leueful it is with force force of schouve
This dronken mellere haþ ytold vs heere
how þat bygyled was a Carpuntere
Perauenture in scorn for I am oon
And by youre leeue I schal him quyte anoon
Right in his cherles termes wil I speke
I preye to god his nekke mote tobreke
he can wel in myn ȝe sen a stalke
But in his owne he can nought seen a balke
AT Trumpyngton nought fer fro Cantabregge
Ther goþ a brook and ouer þat a bregge
vppon þe whiche brook þer stant a Melle
And þis is verray soþ þat I ȝou telle  
A meller was þer duellyng many a day
As any pecok he was proud and gay
Pype he couþe and fissche and nettes beete
And torne coppes and wel wrastle and scheete
Ay by his belt he bar a long Panade
And of a swerd ful trenchant was þe blade
A Ioly popper bar he in his pouche
Ther was noman for peril durste him touche
A scheffeld thwitel bar he in his hose
Round was his face and Camuse was his nose
As pyled as an ape was his sculle
he was a market betere atte fulle
Ther was no wight þat dorst hand on him legge
But if he swor he scholde anon abegge
A þeef he was forsoþe of corn and mele
And þat a sleigh and vsaunt for to stele
his name was hoote deynous Symkyn
A wijf he hadde come of noble kyn
The parsoun of þe toun hir fader was
With hire he yaf ful many a panne of bras
ffor þat Symkyn scholde in his blood allye
Sche was yfostred in a Nonnerie
ffor symkyn wolde no wyf as he sayde
But sche were wel ynorissched and a mayde
To sauen his estate of yomanrie
And sche was proud and pert as is a pye
A ful fair sight was it vppon hem tuo
On halidayes biforn hire wolde he go


Wiþ his typet wounden aboute his heede
And sche cam after in a gyte of reede
And Symkyn hadde hosen of þe same
Ther dorste no wight clepen hire but dame
Was non so hardy þat wente by þe way
That wiþ hire dorste or ones rage or play
But if he wolde be slain of Symkyn
With panade or with knyf or boydekyn  
ffor Ielous folk ben perilous eueremo
Algate þei wolde here wyues wenden so
And eek for sche was somdel smoterlich
Sche was as digne as water in a dich
As ful of hoker and of bisemare
hire þoughte þat a lady schulde hir spare
What for hire kynrede and hire nortelrie
That sche hadde lerned in þe nonnerie
A doughter hadde þe betwixe hem tuo
Of twenty ȝer wiþouten eny moo
Sauyng a childe þat was of half ȝeer age
In cradel it lay it was a proper page
This wenche þikke and wel ygrowen was
Wiþ Camoys nose and eyen grey as glas
Wiþ buttokes brode and brestes rounde and hye
But right fair was hire heer I wol nought lye
 The parson of þe toun for sche was fair
In purpos was to maken hire his hair
Boþe of his catel and his mesuage
And strange he made it of hire mariage
his purpos was for to bistowe hire hye
In to som worþi blood of auncetrie
ffor holy chirches good moot ben dispended
On holy cherche blood þat is descended
Therfore he wolde his holy blood honoure
þough þat þe holy chirche scholde deuoure
Gret soken haþ þis meller out of doute
Wiþ whete and malt of all þe land aboute


And nameliche þer was a gret collegge
Men clepeþ þe Soler halle of Cantabregge
Þere was here whete and eek here malt ygrounde
And on a day it happeþ in a stounde
Syk lay þe manciple on a maladie
Men wenden wisly þat he schulde dye
ffor which þis mellere stal boþe mele and corn
An hundred tyme more þanne biforn  
ffor þer biforn he stal but curteysly
But now he was a theef outrageously
ffor which þe wardein chidde and made fare
But þerof sette þe meller nought a tare
he crakede bost and swor it was nought so
Thanne were þere ȝonge scoleres tuo
That dwelten in þe halle of which I seye
Testyf þey were and lusty for to pleye
And oonly for here mirthe and reuerye
vpon þe wardein bisily þei crye
To ȝif hem leue but a litel stounde
To go to melle and seen here corn ygrounde
And hardily þei dorste leye here nekke
The mellere schulde nat stele hem half a pekke
Of corn ne by sleight ne by force hem Reue
And atte laste þe wardeyn yaf hem leue
Iohn hight þat oon and alayn hight þat oþer
Of oo toun were þei born þat highte strother
ffer in the North I can not telle where
This alayn makeþ redy all his gere
And on an hors þe sak he cast anon
fforþ goþ alayn þe clerk and also Iohn
Wiþ good swerd and wiþ bokeler by his syde
Iohn knew þe wey him needede no guyde
And atte melle þe sak a doun he layth
Alain spak first  alhail Symon in faiþ
how fares þi faire doughter and þi wyf
Alayn welcome quod Symkyn by my lyf


And Iohn also how now what do ȝe heere
By god quod Iohn Symond neede haþ no peere
him bihoues serue himself þat has na swayn
Or elles he is a folt as clerkes sayn
Oure manciple I hope he wil be deed
Swa werkes him ay þe wanges in his heed
And þerfore is I come and eek alayn
To grynde oure corn and carie it ham agayn  
I pray you speedes vs heithen þat ȝe may
It schal be don quod Symkyn by my fay
What wil ȝe doon whil þat it is in hande
By god right by þe hoper wil I stande
Quoþ Iohan and se how gates þe corn gas Inne
Ȝit saugh I neuer by my fader kynne
how þat þe hoper wagged til and fra
Alayn answerde Iohn and wiltow swa
Than wil I be byneþe by my croune
And se how gates þe mele falles a doune
Intil þe trough þat sal be my disporte
Quod Iohn in faath I may ben of ȝour sorte
I is as ille a melle as ere ȝe
This mellere smylede at here nycete
And þought al þis nys don but for a wile
They wene þat no man hem may begyle
But by my þrift yit schal I blere here ye
ffor al þe sleight in here philosophie
The more queinte crekes þat þay make
The more wol I stele whan I take
In stede of flour ȝit wol I yeue hem brenne
The grettest clerkes ben nought þe wisest menne
As whilom to þe wolf þus spak þe mare
Of all here arte counte I nouȝt a tare
 Out of þe dore he goþ ful priuely
Whan þat he saugh his time softely
he lokeþ vp and doun til he haþ founde
The clerkes hors þer as it stood ybounde


Behynde þe mille vnder a leuesel
And to þe hors he goþ him faire and wel
he strepeþ of þe bridel right anoon
And whan þe hors was laus he gynneþ goon
Toward þe fen þare wilde mares renne
And forth with wehe þorugh þikke and þorugh þenne
This meller goþ agayn no word he sayde
But doþ his note and wiþ hise clerkes pleyde  
Til þat hire corn was faire and wel ygrounde
And whan þe mele is sakked and ybounde
This Iohn goþ out and fynt his hors away
And gan to crye harrow and weylaway
Oure hors is lost Alayn for goddes banes
Steppe on þi feet com of man al at anes
Allas oure wardein has his palfray lorn
This aleyn al forgat boþe mele and corn
Al was out of his mynde his housbondrye
What whilk wey is he gon he gan to crye
The wyf cam leepyng inward at a ren
Sche seyde allas ȝour hors goth in þe fen
With wilde mares as faste as he may goo
Vnthank come on his hand þat bond him so
And he þat bettre scholde haue knyt þe reyne
Allas quod Iohn Alayn for cristes peyne
lay doun þi swerd and I wol myn alswa
I is ful swift god wat as is a Ra
By goddes harte he sal nouȝt scape vs baþe
Why ne had þou put þe caple in þe lathe
Ilhaille by godde alayn þou is a fonne
Thise sely clerkes han fulfaste yronne
Toward þe fen boþe alayn and eek Iohn
And whan þe Mellere seigh þat þei were gon
he half a buisschel of here corn haþ take
And bad his wijf go knede it in a cake
And seide I trowe þe clerkes weren aferd
Yet kan a mellere make a clerkes berd


ffor all his art yet lat hem gon here weye
Lo where he goþ ye lat þe children pleye
They gete him nought so lightly by my croun
Thise seely clerkes rennen vp and doun
With keep keep stand stand iossa warderere 
Ga whistel þou and I schal keepe him heere
But schortly til it was verray night
They couþe nought þough þei dede all here might  
here capel cacche he ran alwey so faste
Til in a diche þei caught him atte laste
Wery and wet as beest is in þe rayn
Comeþ seely Iohn and with him comþ alayn
 Allas quod Iohn þe day þat I was born
Now ere we dryuen til hething and til scorn
Oure corn is stole men wil vs fooles calle
Boþe þe wardein and oure felawes alle
And namely þe meller weylawey
Thus pleyneþ Iohan as he goþ by þe wey
Toward þe melle and bayard in his hond
The meller sittyng by þe fyr he fond
ffor it was nyght and ferþer might he nought
But for þe loue of god þei him bisought
Of herberwe and of eese as for here peny
The mellere seyde agayn if þer be eny
Such as if is ȝit schal ȝe haue ȝoure part
Myn hous is streit but ȝe han lerned art
Ȝe can by argumentes make a place
A myle brood of twenty foote of space
lat se now if þis place mow suffise
Or make it rowmere with speche as is ȝoure gyse
Now Symond seyde þis Iohn by seint Cuthberd
As is þou mery and þat is faire answerd
I haue herd say men sal take of tua þinges
Swilk as he fyndes or take swilk as he brynges
But specially I pray þe ooste deere
Gete vs som mete and drynk and mak vs cheere


And we wol payen trewly atte fulle
With empty handes men may naan haukes tulle
Lo heer oure siluer reedy for til spende
This meller to þe toun his doughter sende
ffor ale and breed and rosted hem a goos
And boond here hors it scholde namore go loos
And in his owne chambre he made a bedde
With scheetes and wiþ chalons faire yspredde  
Nought from his oughne bed ten foote or twelue
his doughter hadde a bed al by hir selue
Right in þe same chambre by and by
It mighte be no bette and cause why
Ther was no romer herberwe in þe place
þey soupen and þey speken hem of solace
And drynken euere strong ale atte beste
Aboute mydnyght wente þei to reste
Wel haþ þe mellere vernysshed his heed
fful pale he was fordrunken and nouȝt reed
he yexeth and he spekeþ þurgh þe nose
As he were on þe quakke or on þe pose
To bedde he goþ and with him goþ his wijf
As eny Iay he light was and Iolif
So was hire Ioly whistel wel ywette
The cradell at hire beddes feet is sette
To rokken and yeue þe childe to souke
And whan þat dronken was al in þe crouke
To bedde wente þe doughter right anoon
To bedde goþ Alayn and also Iohn
Ther was nomore þem needede no dwale
This meller haþ so wisely bibbed ale
That as an hors he snorteþ in his slepe
Ne of his tayl behynde he took no keepe
his wijf bar him a burdon a ful strong
Men mighten heere here routyng a furlong
The wenche routeþ eek par compaignie
Alayn þe clerk þat herde þis melodye


he pokede Iohn and seyde sleepist þou
herdestow euer slik a sang ar now
lo swilk a couplyng is bitwixe hem alle
A wilde fyr on þair bodies falle
ho herkned euer slik a ferly þing
Ye þai sall haue þe flour of yll endyng
This lange night þer tydes me na reste
But ȝit na force al schal be for þe beste  
ffor Iohn seide als euer mote I þriue
If þat I may yon wenche wol I swyue
Som esement haþ lawe schapen vs
ffor Iohn þer is a lawe þat seith þus
That if a man in a poynt be agreeued
That in anoþer he schal be releeued
Oure corn is stolen soþly it is no nay
And we han had an ylle fitte to day
And syn I schal haue noon amendement
Agayn my losse I wol haue esement
By goddes sale it sal nan oþir be
This Iohn answerde Alayn so mot I þe
The meller is a perilous man he sayde
And if þat he out of his slape abrayde
he mighte don vs boþe a vilanye
Alayn answerde I counte him nought a flye
And vp he rist and by þe wenche he crepte
This wenche lay vpright and faste slepte
Til he so neigh was or sche mighte spye
That it hadde been to late for to crye
And schortly for to seyn þey were at oon
Now play alayn for I wol speke of Ioon
This Iohn liþ stille a forlong wey or tuo
And to himself he makeþ rouþe and wo
Allas quod he þis is a wikke Iape
Now may I sayn þat I is but an ape
Ȝet haþ my felaw somwhat for his harm
he has þe myllers doughter in his arm


he auntred him and haþ his needes spedde
And I lye as a draf sak in my bedde
And whan þis Iape is told anoþer day
I schal be holde a daffe a Cokenay
I wol arise and aunter it by my faith
vnhardy is vnseely as men saith
And vp he ros and softely he went
vnto þe cradill and in his hand it hent  
And bar it softe vnto his beddes feet
Sone after  þe wif hire routyng leet
And gan to wake and went hire out to pisse
And com agayn and gan hir cradel mysse
And groped heer and þer but sche fond noon
Allas quod sche I hadde almost mys goon
I hadde almost goon to þe clerkes bedde
Ey benedicite þan hadde I foule yspedde
And forþ sche goþ til sche þe cradil fond
Sche gropeþ alwey forþer with hire hond
And fond þe bed and þoughte nought but good
By cause þat þe cradel by it stood
And nyste wher sche was for it was derk
But faire and wel sche crepe in to þe clerk
And lith ful stille and wolde haue caught a slepe
WithInne a while þis Iohn þe clerk vp lepe
And on þis goode wijf he leiþ on sore
So mery a fitte ne hadde sche not ful yore
he prikeþ harde and deepe as he were madde
This Ioly lyf han þise tuo clerkes ladde
Til þat þe þridde cok bygan to synge
Aleyn wax wery in þe dawenynge
ffor he hadde swonken all þe longe nyght
And sayde far wel Malyn sweete wight
The day is come I may no lenger byde
But euermoo wher so I go or ryde
I am þin oughne clerk so haue I hele
Now deere lemman quod sche go far wele


But or þou go oo þing I wol þe telle
Whan þat þou wendest homward by þe melle
Right at þe entre of þe dore behynde
Thou schalt a cake of half a busshel fynde
That was ymaked of þin oughne mele
Which þat I hilpe my sire for to stele
And goode lemman god þe saue and keepe
And with þat word almost sche gan to weepe  
Alayn vprist and þought or þat it dawe
I wol go creepen in by my felawe
And fond þe cradel wiþ his hond anon
By god þought he al wrang I haue mysgon
Myn heed is toty of my swynk to nyght
That makeþ me þat I go nought aright
I wot wel by þe cradel I haue mysgo
here lith þe meller and his wijf also
And forth he goþ on twenty deuelway
vnto þe bed þer as þe meller lay
he wende haue cropen by his felawe Iohn
And by þe mellere in he creep anoon
And caught him by þe necke and softe he spak
he seyde þou Iohn þou swyneshed awak
ffor cristes sawle and heer a noble game
ffor by þat lord þat called is saint Iame
As I haue þries in þis schorte night
Swyued þe mellers doughter bolt vprigh
Whil þou hast as a coward ben agast
þe false harlot quod þe meller hast
A fals traitour false clerk quod he
þou schalt be ded by goddes dignite
Who durste be so bolde to disparage
My doughter þat is comen of such lynage
And by þe þrote bolle he caught alayn
And he hent him dispitously agayn
And on þe nose he smot him with his fiste
Doun ran þe bloody streen vpon his briste


And in þe floor with nose and mouth tobroke
þei walwe as doþ tuo pigges in a poke
And vp þai gon and doun agayn anoon
Til þat þe meller spurned at a stoon
And doun he fel bakward vpon his wijf
That wiste noþing of þis nyce strijf
ffor sche was falle a sleepe a litel wight
With Iohn þe clerk þat waked hadde al þe night  
And with þe falle out of hir sleep sche brayde
help holy cros of bromeholm sche sayde
In manus tuas lord to þe I calle
Awake Symond þe feend is on me falle
Myn herte is broken help I nam but ded
Ther liþ on vp my wombe and vp myn heed
help Symkyn for þe false clerkes fighte
This Iohn starte vp as fast as euer he mighte
And grasped by þe walles to and fro
To fynde a staf and sche stert vp also
And knew þe estris bet þan did þat Iohn
And by þe wal a staf sche fond anon
And saugh a litel schymeryng of a light
ffor at an hole in schoon þe moone bright
And by þat light sche saugh hem boþe tuo
But sikerly sche nyste who was who
But as sche saugh a whit þing in hir eye
And whan sche gan þis white þing aspye
Sche wende þe clerk had wered a voluper
And wiþ þe staf sche drough ay ner and ner
And wende han hitte þis alayn atte fulle
And smot þe meller on þe pilede skulle
That doun he goth and cryed harrow I dye
This clerkes beet him weel and leet him lye
And greyþen hem and tooke here hors anon
And eek here mele and on here wey þey goon
And atte Mille yet þai toke here cake
Of half a busschel flour ful wel ybake


Thus is þe proude Meller wel ybete
And haþ ylost þe gryndyng of þe whete
And payed for þe soper euery dele
Of Alayn and of Iohn þat bette him weel
his wyf is swyued and his doughter als
lo swich it is a mellere to be fals
And þerfore þis prouerbe is seyd ful soth
him þar nat weene wel þat yuel doþ  
A gilour schal himself begyled be
And god þat sitteþ highe in mageste
Saue all þis companye grete and smale
Thus haue I quytte þe meller in my tale
The Cook of london whil þe Reue spak
ffor ioye he þoughte he clawed him on þe bak
ha ha quod he for cristes passioun
This meller haþ a scharp conclusioun
vpon his argument of herbergage
We seide Salamon in his langage
Ne bryng nat euery man in to þin hous
ffor herberwyng be night is perilous
Wel oughte a man auysed for to be
Whom þat he broughte in to his priuite
I praie to god so yeue me sorwe and care
If euere sithen I highte hogge of of ware
herde I mellere bettre yset a werke
he hadde a Iape of malice in þe derke
And þerfore if ȝe vouche sauf to heere
But god forbede þat we stynte heere
A tale of me þat am a pouere man
I wol yow telle as wel as euer I can
A litel Iape þat fil in oure Citee
Oure oost answerde and seide I graunte it þe
Now telle on Roger loke þat it be good
ffor many a paste hast þou latyn blood
And many a Iakke of Douer hast þou sold
That haþ ben twyes hoot and twyes cold
Of many pilgrym hastow cristes curs
ffor of þy persely ȝit þey fare þe wors
þat þei haue eten wiþ þe stubbul goos
ffor in þy schoppe is many a flye loos
Now tel on gentil Roger by þi name
But yet I preye þe be not wroþ for game
A man may say ful soth in game and play
Thou seist ful soþ quod Roger by my fay  

But soþ play quad play as þe flemyng seith
And þerfore herry baillyf by þi feith
Be þou nouȝt wroth or we departen heere
Though þat my tale be of an Ostelleere
But naþeles I wol not tellen it ȝit
But or we parte Iwys þou schalt be quyt
And þer wiþ al he lough and made cheere
And saide his tale as ȝe schal after heere
A Prentys whilom dwelled in oure Citee
And of a craft of vitaillers was he
Gaillard he was as goldfynch in þe schawe
Broun as a berye a propur schort felawe
Wiþ lokkes blake ykempt ful fetysly
Daunce he couthe so wel and Iolyly
That he was cleped Perkyn Reuolour
he was as ful of loue paramour
As is þe hyue ful of hony sweete
Wel was þe wenche with him mighte meete
At euery brydale wolde he synge and hoppe
he louede bet þe tauerne þan þe schoppe
ffor whan þer any rydyng was in chepe
Out of þe schoppe þider wolde he leepe
Til þat he hadde al þe sight yseyn
And daunced wel wolde he not come ageyn
And gadered him a meyne of his sorte
To hoppe and synge and maken such desporte
And þere þei setten steuene for to mete
To pleyen atte dys in such a streete
ffor in þe toun nas þer no prentys
That fairere couþe caste a paire of dys
Than Perkyn couþe and þerto he was fre
Of his dispense in place of priuite
That fond his maister wel in his chaffare
ffor ofte tyme he fond his box ful bare
ffor sikerly a prentys Reuelour  
That haunteþ dys ryot or paramour
his maister schal it in his schoppe abeye
Al haue he not part of þe menstralcye
ffor theft and riot þei ben conuertible
Al conne he play on gyterne or Rubible


Reuel and trouthe as in a lough degre
þey been ful wroþe alday as men may se
This Iolif prentys with his maister bood
Til he were neigh out of his prentyshood
Al were he snybbed boþe erly and late
And som tyme lad with Reuel to Newgate
But atte last his mayster him biþoughte
vpon a day whan he his paper soughte
Of a prouerbe þat seiþ þis same word
Wel bette is roten appul out of hord
þan þat it rotye al þe remenant
So fareþ it by þe riotous seruant
It is ful lasse harm to late it pace
þanne he schende all þe seruantȝ in þe place
Therfore his mayster ȝaf him a quitance
And bad him go with sorwe and with meschance
And þus þis Ioly prentys hadde his leue
Now lat him riote al þe night or leue
And for þer nys no þeef wiþouten a lowke
That helpeþ him to wasten and to sowke
Of þat he brybe can or borwe may
Anon he sente his bedde and his array
vnto a Coupere of his owne sorte
That louede dys and Reuel and disporte
And hadde a wyf þat heeld for contynance
A schoppe  and swyued for hire sustynance
LIthen and lesteneþ and herkeneþ aright
And ȝe schulle heeren of a doughty knight
Sire Iohn of Boundys was his name
he couþe of norture and mochil of game
Thre sones þe knight hadde and with his body he hem wan  
The eldest was a moche schrewe and sone he bigan
his breþeren loued wel here fader and of him were agast
The eldest deserueþ his faderes curs and hadde it atte last
The goode knight his fader lyued so yore
That deþ was comen him to and handlid him ful sore
The goode knight cared sore sik þer he lay
how hise children schulde lyuen after his day
he hadde ben wyde wher but non housbond he was
Alle þe lond þat he hadde it was verrey purchas
ffayn he wolde it were dressed among hem alle
That eche of hem hadde his part as it mighte falle
Tho sente he in to contre after wise knightes
To helpen delen his londes and dressen hem to rightes
he sent hem word by lettres þey scholden hyȝe blyue
If þey wolde speke wiþ him whil he was on lyue


Tho þe knightes herden seek þat he lay
hadde þei no reste neiþer night ne day
Til þei comen to him þer he lay stille
On his deþ bedde to abyde goddes wille
Thanne seyd þe goode knight syk þer he lay
lordes I ȝou warne for soþe wiþouten nay
I may no lengere lyuen heer in þis stounde
ffor þorugh goddes wille deth draweþ me to grounde
Ther nas noon of hem all þat herde him aright
That þay hadden reuþe of þat ilke knight
And seyde sire for goddes loue dismaye ȝou nought
God may don boote of bale þat is now ywrought
Than spak þe goode knight sike þer he lay
Boote of bale god may sende I wot it is no nay
But I beseke ȝou knightes for þe loue of me
Goþ and dresseth my lond among my sones þre
And for þe loue of god deleþ hem nat amys
And forȝeteþ nought Gamelyn my ȝonge sone þat is
Takeþ heede to þat oon as wel as to þat oþer
Seelde ȝe see ony heir helpen his broþer
Tho leeten þey þe knight lyen þat was not in hele  
And wenten in to counseill his londes for to dele
ffor to delen hem all to oon was here þought
And for gamelyn was yongest he scholde haue nought
Alle þe lond þat þer was þai dalten it it tuo
And leeten Gamelyn þe ȝonge wiþoute lond go
And ech of hem seyde to oþer ful loude
his breþeren mowe ȝiue him lond whan he good coude
Whan þei hadde deled þe lond at here wille
Thei camen to þe knight þere he lay ful stille
And tolden him anon how þei hadden wrought
And þe knight þer he lay liked it right nought
Than seide þe knight by seint Martyn
ffor al þat ȝe haue don ȝit is þe lond myn
ffor goddes loue neighebours stondeþ alle stille
And I wol dele my lond right after my wille


Iohn myn eldeste sone schal haue plowes fyue
That was my fadres heritage whil he was on lyue
And my myddelest sone fyue plowes of londe
That I halp for to geten with my right honde
And all myn oþer purchas of londes and leedes
That I bequeþe Gamelyn and all my goode steedes
And I beseke ȝou goode men þat lawe conne of londe
ffor Gamelynes loue þat my bequeste stonde
Thus dalte þe knight his lond by his day
Right on his deþ bedde sik þer he lay
And sone afterward he lay stoon stille
And deyde whan tyme com as it was cristes wille
Anon as he was deed and vnder gras graue
Sone þe oldere broþer gylede þe yonge knaue
he took in to his hond his lond and his leede
And Gamelyn himselue to cloþen and to feede
he cloþed him and fedde him yuel and eek wroþe
And leet his londes and his houses boþe
his parkes and his woodes and dede no þing wel
And sethen he it aboughte on his faire fel
So longe was Gamelyn in his broþeres halle  
ffor þe strengeste of good þei douteden him alle
Ther was non þerInne nowþer ȝong ne olde
That wolde wraþþe Gamelyn were he neuer so bolde
Gamelyn stood on a day in his broþeres ȝerde
And bygan with his hond to handlen his berde
he þought on his londes þat layen vnsawe
And his faire Okes þat doun were drawe
his parkes were broken and his deere reued
Of all his goode steedes non was him bileued
hise houses were vnhiled and ful yuel dight
Tho þoughte Gamelyn it wente nought aright
Afterward cam his broþer walkynge þare
And seyde to Gamely is oure mete yare
Tho wraþþed him Gamelyn and swor by goddes book
þou schat go bake þi self I wol not be þi cook


how broþer Gamelyn  how answerest þou now
Thou spake neuer such a word as þou dost now
By my faiþ sayde Gamelyn now me þinkeþ neede
Of all þe harmes þat I haue I took neuer are heede
My parkes ben ybroken and my deer bireued
Of myn armure and my steedes nought is me bileued
Alle þat my fader me biquaþ al goþ to schame
And þer fore haue þou goddes curs broþer by þy name
Thanne bispak his broþer þat rape was of rees
Stond stille gadelyng and hold right þi pees
Thou schalt be fayn for to haue þi mete and þi wede
What spekest þou Gamelyn of lond oþer of leede
Than seyde Gamelyn þe child þat was ying
Cristes curs mote he haue þat clepeþ me gadelyng
I am no worse gadelyng ne no worse wight
But born of a lady and geten of a knight
Ne durste he not to Gamelyn neer a foote go
But clepede to him his men and seyde to hem þo
Goþ and beteþ þis body and reueþ him his wit
And lat him lere anoþer tyme to answere me bet
Than seyde þe child yonge Gamelyn  
Cristes curs mot þou haue broþer art þou myn
And if I schal algate be beten anon
Cristes curs mote þou haue but þou be þat oon
And anon his broþer in þe grete hete
Made his men to fette staues Gamelyn to beete
Whan þat euerych of hem hadde a staf Inomen
Gamelyn was war þo he seigh hem comen
Tho Gamelyn seigh hem comen he loked ouer all
And was war of a pestel stood vnder a wall
Gamelyn was light and þider gan he lepe
And drof alle his broþeres men right soone on an heepe
he loked as a leon a layde on good won
Tho his broþer seigh þat he bigan to gon
he fleigh vp in til a loft and schette þe dore fast
Thus Gamelyn wiþ his pestelle made hem agast


Somme for gamelynes loue and some for his eye
All þei drowen by halues þo he bigan to pleye
What now seyde Gamelyn yuel mot þou þee
Wil ye bigynne contek and so soone flee
Gamelyn sought his broþer whider he was flowe
And saugh wher he loked out at a wyndowe
Broþer saide Gamelyn come a litel neer
And I wil teche þe a play atte Bokeleer
his broþer him answerde and sayde be seint Richere
Whil þe pestel is in þin hond I wol come no neer
Broþer I wel make þy pees I swere by cristes oore
Cast away þe pestel and wraþþe þe nomore
I moot neede sayde Gamelyn wraþþe me at oones
ffor þou wolde make þi men to breke my boones
Ne hadde I had mayn and might in myn armes
To haue hem driuen fro me þei wolde haue do me harmes
Gamelyn sayd his broþer be þou nought wroþ
ffor to see þe haue harm were me right loþ
I dide it nought broþer but for a fondyng
ffor for to loken or þou were strong and art so ȝing
Com a doun þan to me and graunte me my boone  
Of þing I wol þe asken and we schul saughte soone
Doun þan cam his broþer þat fikel was and felle
And was swithe sore agast of þe pestelle
he seyde broþer Gamelyn aske me þy boone
And loke þou me blame but I it graunte soone
Thanne seyde Gamelyn broþer ywys
And we schulle ben at on þou most me graunte þis
Al þat my fader me biquath whil he was on lyue
Thou most do me it haue if we schulle nouȝt stryue
That schalt þou haue Gamelyn I swere by cristes oore
Al þat þi fader þe byquath þough þou woldest haue more
Thi lond þat lieth laye wel it schal be sowe
And þine houses reised vp þat ben yleyd so lowe
Thus sayde þe knight to Gamelyn by mouþe
And þoughte of falsnesse as he wel couþe


The knight þought on treson and Gamelyn on noon
And went and kissed his broþer and when þey weren at oon
Allas yonge Gamelyn noþing he ne wist
Wiþ such fals tresoun his broþer him kist
liþeneth and lesteneþ and holdeþ youre tonge
And ȝe schul heere talkyng of gamelyn þe ȝonge
Ther was þer besyden cried a wrastelyng
And þer fore þer was vp yset a Ram and a ryng
And Gamelyn was in wille to wende þerto
ffor to preuen his might what he couþe doo
Broþer seyde Gamelyn by seint Richer
Thou most lene me to night a litel courser
That is freissch to þe spores on for to ryde
I moste on an Erande a litel here besyde
By god seyde his broþer of steedes in my stalle
Go and chese þe þe beste spare non of alle
Of steedes or of coursers þat stonden him bysyde
And telle me goode broþer whider þou wolt ryde
here besyde broþer is cryed a wrastlyng
And þerfore schal be sette a Ram and a Ryng
Moche worschipe it were broþer to vs alle  
Might I þe Ram and þe ryng bryngen hom to þis halle
A steede þer was sadeled smartly and skeet
Gamelyn dide a paire spores fast on his feet
he sette his foot in þe styrop þe steede he bistrood
And toward þe wrastelyng þe ȝonche child rood
Tho Gamelyn þe ȝonge was ryden out atte gate
The false knight his broþer loked it after þate
And bisoughte ihesu crist þat is heuen king
he mighte breke his necke in þat wrastlyng
As sone as gamelyn com ther þe place was
he lighte doun of his steede and stood on þe gras
And þere he herde a ffrankelyn wayloway syng
And bigan bitterly his hondes for to wryng
Goode man seide Gamelyn whi makest þou þis fare
Is þer noman þat may ȝou helpen out of þis care


Allas seide þis ffrankleyn þat euer was I bore
ffor tweye stalworþe sones I wene þat I haue lore
A champion is in þe place þat haþ ywrought me sorwe
ffor he haþ slayn my tuo sones but if god hem borwe
I wolde ȝiue ten pound by ihesu crist and more
Wiþ þe nones I fand a man to handelen him sore
Goode man seide Gamelyn wilt þou wel done
hold myn hors whil my man draweþ of my schone
And help my man to kepe my cloþes and my steede
And I wil in to þe place gon to loke if I may speede
By god seide þe ffrankeleyn it schal be doon
I wol my self be þy man to drawen of þi schoon
And wende þou in to þe place ihesu crist þe speede
And drede not of þi cloþes nor of þi goode steede
Barfot and vngert Gamelyn in came
Alle þat were in þe place heede of him þei name
how he dorste auntre him of him to don his might
That was so doughty a champioun in wrastelyng and in fight
vp sterte þe Champioun rapely anon
Toward ȝonge Gamelyn he bigan to goon
And seide who is þi fader and who is þi sire  
ffor soþe þou art a gret fool þat þou come hire
Gamelyn answerde þe Champioun þo
Thou knewe wel my fader whil he couþe goo
Whiles he was on lyue by seint Martyn
Sire Iohn of Boundes was his name and I Gamelyn
ffelawe seide þe Champioun so mote I þriue
I knew wel þi fader whil he was on lyue
And þi self Gamelyn I wol þat þou it heere
Whil þou were a ȝong boy a moche schrewe þou were
Than seide Gamelyn and swor by cristes oore
Now I am oldere woxe þou schalt fynde me a more
By god sayde þe champiōn welcome mote þou be
Come þou ones in myn hond schalt þou neuer þe
It was wel wiþinne þe night and þe moone schon
Whan Gamelyn and þe Champiōn togidere gonne gon


The champioun caste tornes to Gamelyn þat was preste
And Gamelyn stood stille and bad him don his beste
Thanne seyde Gamelyn to þe champioun
Thou art faste aboute to bringe me doun
Now I haue proued many tornes of þine
Thou most he seyde prouen on or tuo of myne
Gamelyn to þe champiōn yede smertly anoon
Of alle þe turnes þat he couþe he schewed him but oon
And kast him on þe left syde þat þe ribbes tobrak
And þarto his oon arm þat yaf a gret crak
þan seyde Gamelyn smertly anoon
Schal it be holde for a cast or elles for noon
By god seyde þe champioun wheþer þat it be
he comeþ oones in þin hond schal he neuer þe
Than seyde þe ffrankelein þat hadde his sone þere
Blessed be þou Gamelyn þat euer þou bore were
The ffrankeleyn seide to þe champiōn of him stod him non eye
This is ȝonge Gamelyn þat taughte þe þis pleye
Aȝein answerde þe Champioun þat liked noþing welle
he is oure alþer maister and his pley is right felle
Siþen I wrastlede ferst it is ygo ful yore  
But I was neuere my lyf handled so sore
Gamelyn stood in þe place alone wiþoute sirk
And sayde if þer be moo lat hem come to werke
The champion þat payned him to werke so sore
It semeth by his continance þat he wol no more
Gamelyn in þe place stood stille as a stoon
    
Ther was non with Gamelyn wolde wrastle more
ffor he handled þe Champiōn so wonderliche sore
Tuo gentil men yemede þe place
Come to Gamelyn god ȝiue him goode grace
And sayden to him do on þin hosen and þi schoon
ffor soþe at þis tyme þis faire is ydone
And þanne sayde Gamelyn so moot I wel fare
I haue nought ȝit haluendel sold my ware


Tho sayde þe Champiōn so brouke I my sweere
He is a fool þat þerof byeþ þou sellest it so deere
Tho saide þe ffrankeleyn that was in moche care
ffelawe he sayde whi lakkest þou his ware
By seint Iame in Galeys þat many man haþ sought
yit it is to good chepe þat þou hast ybought
Tho þat wardeynes were of þat wrastlyng
Come and broughte Gamelyn þe Ram and þe ryng
And sayde haue gamelyn þe Ring and þe Ram
ffor þe beste wrastelere þat euer heere cam
 Thus wan Gamely þe Ram and þe Ryng
And wente with moche Ioye hom in þe mornyng
his broþer seigh wher he cam wiþ þe grete route
And bad schitte þe gate and holde him wiþoute
þe porter of his lord was sore agast
And stert anon to þe gate and lokked it fast
Now liþeþ and lesteneþ boþe ȝong and olde
And ȝe schul heere game of Gamelyn þe bolde
Gamelyn com þer for to haue come In
Than was it schett faste wiþ a pyn
Thanne seyde Gamelyn porter vndo þe gate
ffor many a good mannes sone stondeþ þerate  
Than answerd þe porter and swor by goddes berde
Thou ne schalt Gamelyn come in to þis ȝerde
Thou lixt sayde Gamelyn so brouke I my chyn
he smot þe wiket with his foot and brak away þe pyn
The porter seih þo it mighte no bettre be
he sette foot on erþe he bigan to flee
By my faiþ sayde Gamelyn þat trauaile is lore
ffor I am of foote as light as þou þough þou haddest swore
Gamelyn ouertok þe porter and his teene wrak
And gert him in þe necke þat þe boon tobrak
And took him by þat oon arm and þrew him in a welle
vij fadmen it was deep as I haue herd telle
Whan Gamelyn þe yonge þus hadde playd his play
Alle þat in yerde weren drewen hem away


þei dredden him ful sore for wreke þat he wrought
And for þe faire companye þat he þider brought
Gamelyn ȝede to þe gate and leet  vp wyde
he leet hem in alle þat gone wolde or ryde
And seyde ȝe be welcome wiþouten eny greeue
ffor we wiln ben maisteres heere and aske no man leeue
yesterday I lefte seyde ȝonge Gamelyn
In my broþer seler v tonne of wyn
I wol not þis companye parten a twynne
And ye wol doon after me whil ony sope is þrinne
And if my broþer grucche or make foul cheere
Oþer for spense of mete and drink þat we spenden heere
I am oure catour and bere oure alþer purce
he schal haue for his grucching seint maries curse
My broþer is a negon I swere by cristes oore
And we wol spende largely þat he haþ spared yore
And who þat makeþ grucching þat we heere dwelle
he schal to þe porter in to þe drawe welle
vij dayes and seue night Gamelyn heeld his feeste
With mochel solace was þere and no cheste
In a litel toret his broþer lay steke
And seigh hem wasten his good but durst he not speke  
Erly on a mornyng on þe viije day
The gestes come to Gamelyn and wolde gon here way
lordes sayde Gamelyn wil ye so hye
All þe wyn is not yet drunken so brouk I myn ye
Gamelyn in his herte was wel woo
Whanne his gestes toke hire leue from him for to goo
he wolde þei hadde dwelled lenger and þai saide nay
But bitaughten Gamelyn god and good day
Thus maade Gamelyn his feeste and brought it wel to eende
And after his gestes tok leue to wende
litheþ and lesteneþ and holdeþ ȝoure tonge
And ȝe schul heere gamen of Gamelyn þe ȝonge
herkeneth lordynges and listeneth aright
Whan all gestes were goon how Gamelyn was dight


All þe whil þat Gamelyn held his mangerie
his broþer þought on him be wreke with his treccherie
Tho Gamelynes gestes were riden and ygon
Gamelyn stood anoon allone frend had he noon
Tho after ful soone wiþinne a litel stounde
Gamelyn was taken and ful harde bounde
fforþ com þe false knight out of þe sellere
To Gamelyn his broþer he ȝede ful neere
And seyde to Gamelyn who made þe so bold
ffor to stroyen my stoore of myn houshold
Broþer sayde Gamelyn wraþþe þe right nouȝt
ffor it is many day go siþþen it was bought
ffor broþer þou hast had by seint Richer
Of fiftene plowes of lond þis xvj ȝer
And of alle þe beestes þou hast forþ bred
That my fader me byquath on his deth bed
Of alle þis xvj ȝeer I yiue þe þe prow
ffor þe mete and þe drink þat we haue spended now
Thanne seyde þe false knight yuel mote he þee
herkne broþer Gamelyn what I wol yiue þee
ffor of my body broþer geten heer haue I noon
I wil make þe myn heir I swere by sein Iohn  
Par ma fay seyde Gamelyn and it so bee
And þou þenke as seist god ȝelde it þe
No þing wiste Gamelyn of his broþeres gile
Therfore he him begiled in a litel while
Gamelyn seyde he o þing I þe telle
Tho þou þrewe my porter in to þe drawe welle
I swoor in þat wraþþe and in þat grete moot
þat þou scholdest be bounde boþe hand and foot
Therfore I þe beseche broþer Gamelyn
Lat me nought be forsworne broþer artow myn
Lat me bynde þe boþe hand and foote
ffor to halde myn avow as I þe bihoote
Broþer seyde Gamelyn as so mote I þee
Thou schalt nought be forsworne for þe loue of me


Tho maden þei gamelyn to sitte might he not stonde
Til þei hadden him bounde boþe foot and honde
The false knight his broþer of Gamelyn was agast
And sente after feteres to feteren him atte last
his broþer made lesynges on him þer he stood
And tolde hem þat comen In that Gamelyn was wood
Gamelyn stood to a post bounden in þe halle
Tho that comen in lokeden on him alle
Euer stood Gamelyn euen vpright
But mete and drink hadde he noon noþer day ne night
Thanne sayde Gamelyn broþer by myn hals
Now I haue aspied þou art a party fals
hadde I wist þat treson þat þou haddest yfounde
I wolde haue youe strokes or I hadde be bounde
Gamelyn stood bounden stille as eny stoon
Tuo daies and tuo nightes mete hadde he noon
Thanne sayde Gamelyn þat stood ybounde stronge
Adam spenser me þink I faste to longe
Adam þe spenser now I beseche þe
ffor þe moche loue my fader loued þe
If þou may come to þe kayes leese me out of bonde
And I schal parte wiþ þe of my free londe  
Thanne sayde adam þat was þe spenser
I haue serued þi broþer þis xvj ȝer
If I lete þe gon out of his boure
he wolde say afterward I were a traitour
Adam seyde Gamelyn so brouke I myn hals
þou schalt fynde my broþer atte laste right fals
Therfore broþer adam loose me out of bondes
And I wil parte with þe of my free londes
vp swich a forward seide adam ywys
I wol do þerto al þat in me is
Adam seyde Gamelyn also mote I þee
I wil holde þe couenant and þou wil lose me
Anon as adames lord to bedde was ygoon
Adam tok þe kayes and leet Gamelyn out anon


He vnlokked Gamelyn boþe handes and feet
In hope of auancement þat he him biheet
Thanne seide Gamelyn þanked be goddes sonde
Now I am loosed boþe foot and honde
hadde I now eten and drunken aright
Ther is non in þis hous schulde bynde me þis night
Adam took Gamelyn stille as stille as eny stoon
And ladde him in to spense rapely and anoon
And sette him to soper right in a priue stede
he bad him do gladly and Gamelyn so dede
Anon as Gamelyn hadde eten wel and fyn
And þerto ydronke wel of þe reede wyn
Adam seyde Gamelyn what is now þy rede
ffor I go to my broþer and gyrde of his hede
Gamelyn seyde adam it schal nouȝt be so
I can teche þe a reede þat is worth þe tuo
I wot wel for soþe þat þis is no nay
We schulle haue a mangery right on sonday
Abbotes and Priours many heer schal be
And oþer men of holy chirche as I telle þe
þou schalt stonde vp by þe poste as þou were hond fast
And I schal leue þam vnloke þat away þou may hem caste  
Whan þat þei haue eten and wasshen here hondes
Thou schalt biseke hem alle to bringe þe out of bondes
And if þei wil borwe þe þat were good game
Thanne were þou out of prison and I out of blame
And if ech of hem sey to vs nay
I schal don anoþer I swere by þis day
Thou schalt haue a good staff and I wol haue anoþer
And cristes curs haue þat oon þat failleþ þat oþer
Ya for gode seyde Gamelyn I say it for me
If I faile on my syde yuele mote I þe
If we schulle algate assoile hem of here synne
Warne me broþer adam whan we schul begynne
Gamelyn seyde adam by seinte charite
I wil warne þe biforn whan þat it schal be


Whan I twynk on þe loke for to gone
And cast awey þe fetteres and come to me anoon
Adam seyde Gamelyn blessed be þy boones
That is a good counsail yeuyng for þe nones
If þey werne me to bringe me out of beendes
I wol sette goode strokes right on here lendes
Tho þe sonday was ycome and folk to þe feeste
ffaire þei were welcomed boþe leste and meeste
And euere as þey atte hall dore comen In
Thay caste þair yhe on ȝonge Gamelyn
The false knight his broþer and ful of trecchery
Alle þe gestes þat þer were atte mangery
Of Gamelyn his broþer he tolde hem with mouþe
All þe harme and þe schame þat he telle couþe
Tho þei were serued of messes tuo or þre
Thanne seyde Gamelyn how serue ȝe me
It is not wel serued by god þat al made
That I sitte fastyng and oþer men make hem glade
The fals knight his broþer þere þat he stood
Tolde all his gestes þat Gamelyn was wood
And Gamelyn stood stille and answerde nought
But adames wordes he heeld in his þought  
Tho Gamelyn gan speke dolfully wiþ alle
To þe grete lordes þat saten in þe halle
lordes he seyde for cristes passion
help to brynge Gamelyn out of prison
Thanne seyde an abbot sorwe on his cheeke
he schal haue cristes curs and seinte maries eeke
That þe out of prisoun beggeth or borweth
But euere worþe hem wel þat doþ þe moche sorwe
After þat abbot þan spak anoþer
I wolde þin hed were offe þey þou were my broþer
Alle þat þe borwe foule moot þam falle
Thus þei seide alle þat weren in þe halle
Than seyde a priour yuel mote he þriue
It is moche sorwe and and skaþe boy þat þou art on lyue


Ow seyde Gamelyn so brouke I my bon
Now I haue aspied þat freendes haue I noon
Cursed mot he worthe boþe fleisshe and blood
That euere do priour or abbot eny good
Adam þe spenser took vp þe cloþe
And loked on Gamelyn and seih þat he was wrooth
Adam on þe Pantrie litul he þought
But tuo goode staues to halle dore he brought
Adam looked on Gamelyn and he was war anon
And cast awey þe feteres and he bygan to goon
Tho he cam to adam he took þat oo staf
And bigan to worche and goode strokes yaf
Gamleyn cam in to þe halle and þe spencer bothe
And loked hem aboute as þei hadde be wroþe
Gamelyn sprengeþ holy water with an ook spire
That somme þat stoode vpright felle in the fire
Ther was no lewed man þat in þe halle stood
That wolde do Gamelyn any þing but good
But stooden besyden and lete hem boþe werche
ffor þei hadde no reuþe of men of men of holy cherche
Abbot or priour monk or chanon
That Gamelyn ouertok anon þei ȝeden doun  
Ther was non of hem alle þat wiþ his staf mette
That he made hem ouerþrowe and quitte hem his dette
Gamelyn sayde adam for sainte charite
Pay good lyueray for þe loue of me
And I wol kepe þe dore so euer heere I masse
Er þei ben assoiled þer schal non passe
Dout þe nouȝt seide Gamelyn whil we ben in feere
Kepe þou wel þe dore and I wol werche heere
Stere good adam and late þer none flee
And we schulle telle largely how many þer be
Gamelyn seyde adam do hem but good
Thay ben men of holy che draw of hem no blood
Saue wel þe croune and do hem non harmes
But breke boþe here legges and siþþen here armes


Thus Gamelyn and adam wroughte right faste
And pleyden with þe monkes and made hem agaste
Thider þey come rydyng Iolyly wiþ swaynes
And hom aȝein þei were ledde in Cartes and in waynes
Tho þei hadden alle ydon þan seyde a gray frere
Allas sire abbot what dide we now heere
Tho þat we comen hider it was a cold rede
vs hadde ben better at home wiþ water and wiþ breed
Whil Gamelyn made ordres of monkes and freere
Euer stood his broþer and made foul cheere
Gamelyn vp wiþ his staf þat he wel knew
And gerte him in þe nekke þat he ouerþrew
A litel aboue þe girdel þe riggebon tobarst
And sette him in þe feteres þer he sat arst
Sitte þere broþer seyde Gamelyn
ffor to coole þi blood as I dide myn
As swiþe as þei hadde wroken hem on here foon
They askede water and wisshen anoon
What somme for here loue and somme for awe
Alle þe seruantz serued hem of þe beste lawe
The scherreue was þenne but fyue myle
And al was told him in a litel while  
how Gamelyn and adam hadde don a sory res
Bounden and wounded men aȝein þe kinges pees
Tho bigan sone strif for to wake
And þe scherref aboute Gamelyn for to take
Now litheþ and lesteneþ so god ȝiue ȝou good fyn
And ȝe schul heere good game of ȝonge Gamelyn
ffour and twenty ȝonge men þat helden ful bolde
Come to þe scherref and seyde þat þai wolde
Gamelyn and adam fette be way
The scherref yaf hem leue soþ as I ȝou say
þei hieden faste wolde þay nought belynne
Til þei comen to þe gate þer gamelyn was Inne
They knokken on þe gate þe porter was ney
And loked out at an hole as man þat was sleigh


The porter hadde beholde þam a litel while
he louede Gamelyn and was adrad of gile
And leet þe wiket stonde ful stille
And asked hem wiþoute what was here wille
ffor all þe grete company þanne spak but oon
Vndo þe gate porter and lat vs In goon
Than seyde þe porter so brouke I my chynne
Ȝe schul sey ȝour erand er ȝe comen Inne
Sey to Gamelyn and adam if þeir wille be
We wol speke to hem two wordes or þre
ffelaw sayde þe porter stond þere stille
And I wol wende to Gamelyn to witen his wille
In wente þe porter to Gamelyn anon
And saide sire I warne ȝou here ben come ȝoure foon
The scherreues men ben atte gate
ffor to take ȝou boþe schulle ȝe not scape
Porter seyde Gamelyn so mote I wel þe
I wol allowe þe þi wordes whan I my tyme see
Go aȝein to þe gate and dwelle wiþ hem a while
And þou schalt see right soone porter a gyle
Adam seyde Gamelyn loke þe to goone
We haue foomen atte gate and freendes neuer oone  
It ben þe scherreues men þat hider ben ycome
Thei ben swore togidere þat we schul be nome
Gamelyn saide adam hye þe right blyue
And if I faile þe þis day yuel mote I þriue
And we schulle so welcome þe Scherreues men
That somme of hem schulle make here beddes in þe fen
Atte posterne gate Gamelyn out wente
And a good cart staf in his hond he hente
Adam hente soone anoþer gret staf
ffor to helpe Gamelyn and goode strokes he ȝaf
Adam felde tweyne and Gamelyn felde þre
That oþer sette feet on erþe and bigan to flee
What seide adam so euere heere I masse
I haue right good wyn  drynke or ȝe passe


Nay by god sayde þai þi drink is not good
It wolde make a mannes brayn to lyen in his hood
Gamelyn stood stille and loked him aboute
And saide þe scherref comeþ with a gret route
Adam seide Gamelyn what be now þy redes
here comeþ þe scherreue and wil haue oure heedes
Adam sayde to Gamelyn my reed is now þis
Abyde we no longere if we fare amys
I rede þat we to woode goon ar þat we be founde
Bettre is it þer louse þan in toune ybounde
Adam tok by þe hond ȝonge Gamelyn
And euery of hem drank a draught of wyn
And after token here cours and wenten here way
Tho fond þe scherreue nest and noon ay
The scherref lighte doun and went in to þe halle
And fond þe lord fetered faste wiþ alle
þe scherreue vnfetered him right soone anon
And sente after a leche to hele his regge bon
lete we now þis false knight lye in his care
And talke we of Gamelyn and loke how he fare
Gamelyn in to þe woode stalkede stille
And adam þe spenser likede right ylle  
Adam swore to Gamelyn by seint richeer
Now I see it is mery to ben a spenser
That leuere me were keyes to bere
Than walken in þis wilde woode my cloþes to tere
Adam sayde Gamelyn dismaye þe right nought
Many good mannes childe in care is brought
As þei tooke talking boþe in feere
Adam herde talking of men and neigh him þought þei were
Tho Gamelyn vnder woode loked aright
vij score of ȝonge men he say wel adight
Alle satte atte mete compas aboute
Adam sayde Gamelyn now haue ȝe no doute
After bale comes boote þorugh goddes might
Me þinkeþ of mete and drynk þat I haue a sight


Adam lokede þo vnder woode bowgh
And þo he say mete he was glad ynough
ffor he hopede to god for to haue his deele
And he was sore alonged after a good meele
As he saide þat word þe mayster outlawe
Saugh Gamelyn and adam vnder woode schawe
ȝonge men seyde þe maister by þe god roode
I am war of gestes god sende vs goode
ȝond been tuo yonge men right wel adight
And perauenture þer ben mo who so loked aright
Ariseþ vp yonge men and sette hem to me
It is good þat we witen what men it be
vp þei sterten vij fro þe dyner
And metten with Gamelyn and adam spenser
Whan þei were neih hem þan seyde þat oon
yeldeþ vp yonge men ȝour bowes and your floon
Thanne seide Gamelyn þat yong was of elde
Moche sorwe mote he haue þat to yow hem ȝeelde
I corse non oþer but right my selue
þey ȝe fette to yow fyue þanne ye be twelue
þo þei herde by his word þat might was in his arm
There was non of hem þat wolde don him harm  
But seide to gamelyn myldely and stille
Com afore oure maister and say to him þi wille
yonge men seyde Gamelyn by your leute
What man is ȝour maister þat ye with be
Alle þei answerde wiþoute lesyng
Oure mayster is crouned of outlawes king
Adam sayde Gamelyn go we in cristes name
he may neyþer mete ne drynk werne vs for schame
If þat he be kynde and come of gentil 
he wol yeue vs mete and drynk and don vs som good
By saint Iame saide adam what harm þat I gete
I wol auenture me to þe dore þat I hadde mete
Gamelyn and adam wente forþ in feere
And þei grette þe maister þat þey founde þere


Than seyde þe mayster king of outlawes
What seeke ȝe yonge men vnder þe woode schawes
Gamelyn answerde þe king wiþ his croune
he moste needes walke in woode þat may not walke in towne
Sire we walke not heere non harm to do
But if we meete a deer to schete þer to
As men þat ben hungry and mowe no mete fynde
And ben harde bestad vnder woode lynde
Of Gamelynes wordes þe mayster hadde rewþe
And seyde ye schal haue ynough haue god my treuþe
he bad hem sitte doun for to take reste
And bad hem ete and drynke and þat of þe beste
As þei eeten and dronke wel and fyn
Than saide þat oon to þat oþer þis is Gamelyn
Tho was þe maister outlawe in to counseil nome
And tolde how it  was Gamelyn þat þider was ycome
Anon as he herde how it was byfalle
he made him maister vnder him ouer hem alle
Wiþinne þe þridde weke him come tydynges
To þe mayster outlawe þat was here kynges
þat he schulde come home his pees was maad
And of þat goode tydyng he was ful glaad  
Tho sayde he to his ȝonge men soþ for to telle
Me ben comen tydynges I may no lenger dwelle
Tho was Gamelyn anon wiþoute taryyng
Maad mayster outlawe and crouned here king
Tho was Gamelyn crouned king of outlawes
And walked a while vnder woode schawes
The false knight his broþer was scherreue and sire
And leet his broþer endite for hate and for Ire
Tho were his bonde men sory and noþing gladde
Whan Gamelyn here lord wolfes heed was cried and maad
And sente out of his men wher þey might him fynde
ffor to seeke Gamelyn vnder þe woode lynde
To tellen him tydynges the wynd was went
And all his good reued and his men schent


Whan þei had him founden on knees þey hem setten
And adoun with here hood and here lord gretten
Sire wraþþe you nought for þe goode roode
ffor we haue brought ȝou tydynges but þei ben not goode
Now is þy broþer scherreue and haþ þe baillie
And haþ endited þe and wolfes heed doþ þe crye
Allas sayde Gamelyn þat euer I was so slak
That I ne hadde broke his necke þo I his rigge brak
Goþ greeteþ wel myn housbondes and wijf
I wil ben atte nexte schire haue god my lijf
Gamelyn cam wel redy to þe nexte schire
And þere was his broþer boþe lord and sire
Gamelyn com boldely in to þe moot halle
And putte adoun his hood among þe lordes alle
God saue yow lordynges þat now heere be
But broke bak Scherreue yuel mote þou þee
Why hast þou do me þat schame and vilenye
ffor to late endite me and wolues heed do me crye
Tho þoughte þe false knight for to ben awreke
And leet take Gamelyn most he nomore speke
Might þer be no more grace but Gamelyn atte laste
Was cast in to prison and fetered faste  
 Gamelyn haþ a broþer þat highte sire Oote
As good a knight and heende as mighte gon on foote
Anon ȝeede a messager to þat goode knight
And told him altogider how Gamelyn was dight
Anon as sire Oote herde how Gamelyn was dight
he was right sory was he noþing light
And leet sadle a steede and þe way he nam
And to his tweyne breþeren right soone he cam
Sire sayde sire Ote to þe Scherreue þo
We ben but þre breþeren schulle we neuer be mo
And þou hast prisoned þe beste of vs alle
Swich anoþer broþer yuel him mote bifalle
Sire Ote seyde þe fals knight lat be þi curs
By god for þi wordes he schal fare þe wurs


To þe kinges prisone he is ynome
And þer he schal abyde to þe Iustice come
Parde saide sire Ote bettre it schal be
I bidde him to maympris þat þou graunte to me
Til þe nexte sittyng of deliuerance
And late þanne Gamelyn stande to his chaunce
Broþer in swich a forward I take him to þe
And by þi fader soule þat þe bigat and me
But he be redy whan þe Iustice sitte
Thou schalt bere his Iuggement for all þi grete witte
I graunte wel seide sire Ote þat it so be
let deliuere him anon and tak him to me
Tho was Gamelyn deliuered to sire Ote his broþer
And þat night dwelleden þat oon wiþ þat oþer
On þe morwe seyde Gamelya to sire Ote þe heende
Broþer he seyde I moot for soþe fro þe weende
To loke how my yonge men leden here lyf
Wheþer þey lyuen in Ioye or elles in strif
By god seyde sire Ote þat is a cold rede
Now I se þat all þe cark schal falle on myn hede
ffor whan þe Iustice sitte and þou be nought yfounde
I schal anon be take and in þy stede ybounde  
Broþer sayde Gamelyn dismaie þe nought
ffor by saint Iame in Gales that many man haþ sought
If þat god almighty holde me my lyf and witte
I wil be þere redy whan þe Iustice sitte
Thanne seide sire Ote to Gamelyn god schilde þe fro schame
Com whan þou seest tyme and bryng vs out of blame
 litheth and lesteneth and holdeþ ȝou stille
And ȝe schulle heere how Gamelyn hadde his wille
Gamelyn wente vnder þe woode Rys
And fond þere pleying yonge men of pris
Tho was yonge Gamelyn right glad ynough
Whan he fond his men vnder þe woode bough
Gamelyn and his men talked in feere
And þey hadde good game here maister to heere


his men tolden him of auentures þat þei hadde yfounde
And Gamelyn him tolde aȝein how he was faste bounde
Whil Gamelyn was outlawe hadde he no curs
Ther was no man þat for him ferde þe wors
But abbotes and priours monk and Chanōn
On of hem lefte he nought whan he might hem nom
Whil Gamelyn and his men made merþes Ryue
The false knight his broþer yuel mote he þriue
ffor he was faste aboute boþe o day and oþer
ffor to hire þe queste to hangen his broþer
Gamelyn stood on a day and he biheeld
The woodes and þe schawes in þe wilde feeld
he þought on his broþer how he him beheet
Þat he wolde be redy whan þe Iustice seet
he þoughte wel þat he wolde wiþoute delay
Come afore þe Iustice to keepen his day
And seide to his yonge men dighte yow ȝare
ffor whan þe Iustice sitte we mote be þare
ffor I am vnder borwe til þat I come
And my broþer for me to prison schal be nome
By seint Iame seide his ȝonge men and þou rede þertoo
Ordeigne how it schal be and it schal be do  
Whil Gamelyn was comyng þer þe Iustice satte
The false knight his broþer foryatte he not þatte
To hire þe men on his quest to hangen his broþer
Though þey hadde nought þat oon he wolde haue þat oþer
Tho cam Gamelyn fro vnder woode Rys
And broughte with him ȝonge men of prys
I se wel seyde Gamelyn the Iustice is sette
Go aforn adam and loke how it spette
Adam wente in to þe halle and loked all aboute
he seih þere stonde lordes boþe grete and stoute
And sire Ote his broþer fetered wel fast
Tho went adam out of halle as he were agast
Adam seide to Gamelyn and to his felawes alle
Sire Ote stant fetered in þe moot halle


yonge men sayde Gamelyn þis þey heeren alle
Sire Ote stant fetered in þe moot halle
If god yif vs grace wel for to do
he schal it abegge þat it broughte þerto
Thanne seyde Gamelyn þat lokkes hadde hore
Cristes curs most he haue þat him bond so sore
And þou wolt Gamelyn don after my reed
Ther is non in þe halle schal bere awey his heed
Adam seyde Gamelyn we wille nought doon so
We wol sle þe gultyf and late þe oþer go
I wil in to þe halle and wiþ þe Iustice speke
On hem þat ben gultyf I wol ben awreke
late non scape at þe dore yonge men take yeme
ffor I wol be Iustice þis day doomes to deeme
God speede me þis day at my newe werk
Adam com with me for þou schalt be my clerk
his men answerde him and bad him don his best
And if þou to vs haue neede þou schalt fynde vs preste
We wiln stande with þe whil þat we may dure
And but we werken manly pay vs non hure
Yonge men sayde Gamelyn so mot I wel þee
As trusty a maister ye schal fynde of me  
Right þer þe Iustice sat in þe halle
In wente Gamelyn amonges hem alle
Gamelyn leet vnfettere his broþer out of bende
Thanne seide sire Otes his broþer þat was heende
Thou haddest almost Gamelyn dwelled to longe
ffor þe queste is out on me þat I scholde honge
Broþer seide Gamelyn so god yif me good rest
This day þey schul ben hanged þat ben vpon þe quest
And þe Iustice boþe þat is þe Iugge man
And þe schirriue boþe þorugh him it bigan
Thanne seyde Gamelyn to þe Iustise
Now is þy power don þou most nedes arise
Thou hast yiuen doomes þat ben yuel dight
I wil sitten in þi sete and dressen hem aright


The Iustice sat stille and roos nought anoon
And Gamelyn cleuede his cheke boon
Gamelyn tok him in his armes and nomore spak
But þrewe him ouer þe barre and his arme tobrak
Durste non to Gamelyn seye but good
ffor fered of þe companye þat wiþoute stood
Gamelyn sette him doun in þe Iustices sete
And sire Otes his broþer by him and adam at his feet
Whan Gamelyn was sette in þe Iustices sete
herkne of a bourde þat Gamelyn dede
he leet fetere þe Iustice and his false brother
And leet hem come to þe barre þat oon wiþ þat oþer
Tho Gamelyn hadde þus ydon hadde he no rest
Til he hadde enquered who was on þe quest
ffor to deemen his broþer sire Otes for to honge
Er he wiste which þei were he þoughte ful longe
But as sone as Gamelyn wiste wher þey were
he dede hem euerichon feteren in fere
And bringen hem to þe barre and sette hem in Rewe
By my faith seide þe Iustice þe Scherreue is a schrewe
Thanne sayde Gamelyn to þe Iustice
Thou hast youe doomes of þe wors assise  
And þe xij Sisours that weren of þe queste
They schulle ben hanged þis day so haue I good reste
Thanne seyde þe Scherreue to yonge Gamelyn
lord I crye þe mercy broþer art þou myn
Therfore saide Gamelyn haue þou cristes curs
ffor and þou were maister yet I schulde haue wors
ffor to make schort tale and nought to long
he ordeigned him a queste of his men so strong
The Iustice and þe Scherreue beþ honged hye
To weiuen with þe Ropes and with þe wynd drye
And þe xij Sisours sorwe haue þat rekke
Alle þey were hanged faste by þe nekke
Thus endeth þe false knight with his treccherie
That euer hadde lad his lyf in falsnes and folye


he was hanged by þe necke and nought by þe purs
That was þe meede þat he hadde for his fadres curs
Sire Otes was eldest and Gamelyn was ying
Wenten with here frendes and passed with þe king
They made pees with þe king of þe best assise
The king loued wel sire Ote and made him Iustice
And after þe king made Gamelyn boþe in est and west
Cheef Iustice of his fre fforest
Alle his wighte yonge men þe king foryaf here gilt
And siþþen in good office þe king haþ alle hem pilt
 Thus wan Gamelyn his lond and his leede
And wrak him of his enemys and quitte hem here meede
And sire Ote his broþer made him his heir
And siþþen wedded Gamelyn a wyf a good and a fair
They lyueden togidere whil þat crist wolde
And siþþen was gamelyn grauen vnder molde
And so schal we alle may þer noman flee
God bring vs to þe Ioye þat euer schal be AmeN pour charite
Owre oost saugh wel þat by þe brighte sonne
The ark of his artificial day hadde ronne
The ferþe part of half an hour and moore
And þough he were nought deepe expert in lore  
he wist it was þe xviije day
Of Aprille þat is messager to May
And saugh wel þat þe schadwe of euery tree
Was as in lengþe þe same quantite
That was þe body erect þat caused it
And þerfore by þe schadewe he took his wit
That Phebus which þat schon so cler and bright
Degrees was xlv clombe on hight
And for þat day as in þat latitude
It was ten atte clokke he gan conclude
And sodeinly he plight his hors aboute
lordynges quod he I warne ȝou alle þis route
The ferþe party of þis day is gon
Now for þe loue of god and of seint Iohn

Lordinges þe time it wasteþ night and day
And steleþ from vs what priuely slepyng
And what þurgh necligence in oure waking

Of þikke wicke ensample of Canace

That is so horrible a tale for to rede
Whan he hir þrew þorugh þe pament
And þerfore he of ful auisement

 In Surrye whilom dwelt a companye
Of Chapmen riche and þerto sad and trewe
That wyde where sente here spicerie

That euery wight haþ deynte to chaffare
With hem and eek to sellen hem here ware
 Now fil it þat þe maistres of þat sort

Were it fo chapmanhode or for disport
Non oþer message wolde þey þider sende
But comen hemself to Rome þis is þe ende
And in swich place as þought hem auantage

Soiorned han þise marchantez in þat toun  
A certein tyme as felle to hire plesance
But so felle þat þe excellent renoun
Of þe Emperour doughter dame Custance
Reported was with euery circumstance

 This was þe comone voys of euery man
Oure emperour of Rome god him see
A doughter he haþ þat syn þe world bigan
To rekne as wel hir goodnesse as beaute
Nas neuer such anoþer as is sche
I pray to god in honour hir sustene
And wolde sche were of alle Europe þe queene
  
 In hire is heigh beaute wiþoute pride

To alle hire werkes vertu is hire guyde
humblesse haþ slayn in hire al tyrannye
Sche is a merour of alle curtesye

 And al þis voys is soþ as god is trewe
But now to purpos lat vs turne again

Of him þat was þe Sowdon of Surrie

Make hem good chere and besily aspie

Thise marchantz han him told of Dame Custance  
So gret noblesse in ernest ceriously
That þis Sowdan haþ caught so gret plesance
To han hire figure in his remembrance
And alle his lust and alle his besy cure
Was for to loue hire whil his lijf may dure
Parauenture in þilke large book
Which þat þei cleped þe heuen write was
Wiþ sterres whan þat he his birþe took
That he for loue schulde han his deþ allas
  
ffor in þe sterres clerer þan is þe glas
Is writen god wot  who so cowde it rede
The deþ of euery man wiþouten drede
 In sterres many a wynter þer biforn
Was write þe deth of Ector Achilles
Of Pompe Iulius or þei were born
The stryf of Thebes and of hercules
Of Sampson Turnus and of Socrates
The deth but mennes wittes ben so dulle
That no wight can wel rede it atte fulle
This Sowdon for his priuey counseil sente
And schortly of þis mater for to pace
he haþ to hem declared his entente
And seide hem certein but if he might haue grace
To haue Custance wiþinne a litel space
he nas but ded and charged hem in hye
To schapen for his lyf som remedye
 Diuerse men diuerse þinges seiden
The argumentes casten vp and doun
Many a sotil reson forþ þey leyden
They speken of Magique and abusion
But fynally as in conclusion
They can not seen in þat non auantage
Ne in non oþer weye saf mariage
 Than saugh þey þer in such difficulte
By way of reson for to speke al playn
By cause þat þer was such diuersite  
Bitwen here boþe lawes þat þei sayn
They trowe þat no cristne prince wolde fain
Wedde his child vnder oure lawes so sweete
That vs was taught by mahon oure prophete
  
 And he answerde raþer þan I leese
Custance I wol be cristned douteles
I mot ben hires I may non oþer cheese
I pray ȝow holdeþ ȝour argumentz in pees
Saueþ my lif and beþ nought Recheles
To geten hire þat haþ my lif in cure
ffor in this woo I may not longe endure
 What nedeþ grettere dilatacion
I seie by tretys and embassadrie
And by þe popes mediacion
And alle þe chirche and alle þe chiualrie
That in distruction of mawmattrie
And in encres of cristes lawe deere
They ben accorded so as ȝe schal heere
 how þat þe Sowdan and his Baronage
And alle his lieges schold ycristened be
And he schal han Custance in mariage
And certein gold y not what quantite
And herto founden sufficeant seurte
This same accord was sworn in either syde
Now faire Custance almighty god þe gyde
Now wolde sommen waiten as I gesse
That I schulde tellen al þe purueance
That þe Emperour of his noblesse
hath schapen for his doughter dame Custance
Wel may men knowe þat so gret ordinance
May noman tellen in a litel clause
As was arrayed for so heigh a cause
 Bisschoppes ben schapen wiþ hire for to wende
lordes ladies knightes of renoun
And oþer folk ynowe þis is þe ende
And notified is þurgh out þe toun    
That euery wight wiþ gret deuocion
Scholde preye crist þat he þis mariage
Resceyue in gree and speede þis viage
 The day is come of hir departyng
I sey þe woful lady fatal is come
That þer may be no lenger tarying
But forþward þey hem dressen alle and some
Custance þat with sorw is al ouercome
fful pale arist and dresseþ hire to wende
ffor wel sche seeth þer is non oþer ende
Allas what wonder is it þough sche wepte
That schal be sent to strange nacion
ffro freendes þat so tendrely hire kepte
And to be bounden vnder subiection
Of oon sche knoweth not his condicion
housbondes ben alle goode and han ben yore
That knowen wyfes I dar say ȝou namore
 ffader sche sayde þi wrecchede child Custaunce
Thy yonge doughter fostred vp so softe
And ye my mooder my souereigne plesance
Ouer alle þing out taken crist a lofte
Custance youre child hir recomandeþ ofte
vnto your grace for I schal to Surrie
Ne schal I neuer seen ȝou more with ye
Allas vnto þe Barbarie nacion
I moste anon siþþen it is your wille
But crist þat starf for oure Redempcion
So yeue me grace his hestes to fulfille
I wrecche womman no fors þough I spille
Wommen are born to thraldom and penance
And to ben vnder mannes gouernance
  
 I trowe at Troye whan Purrus brak þe walle
Or ylion þat brende Thebes þat Citee
Not Rome for the harme thurgh hanybal
That Romayns haþ venquissed tymes þre
Nas herde such tendre weepyng for pite  
As in þe Chambre for hire departyng
But forþ sche moot wher so sche weepe or syng
 O ferste moeuyng cruel firmament
Wiþ þy diuinal sweigh that crowdest ay
And hurlest alle fro Est to Occident
That naturelly wolde holde anoþer way
Thy crowdyng sett þe heuen in such array
Atte bygynnyng of þis fiers viage
That cruel mars haþ slain þis mariage
 Infortunat ascendent tortuous
Of which þe lord is helples falle allas
Out of his angle in to þe derkest hous
O mars o ataȝir as in þis cas
O fieble moone vnhappy been þy paas
Thou knettest þe þer þou nart nought receyued
There þou were wel fro þens now art þou weyued
 Imprudent Emperour of Rome allas
Was þer no Philosophre in al þi toun
Is no tyme bet þan oþer in such caas
Of viage is þer non election
Namly to folk of heigh condicion
Nat whan a roote is of a burthe yknowe
Allas ȝe ben to lewed or to slowe
 The schip is brought þis woful faire mayde
Solempnely wiþ euery circumstance
Now Ihesu crist be with ȝou alle sche sayde
Ther nys nomore but far wel faire Custance
  
Sche peyneþ hire to make good contynance
And forþ I lete hire saile in þis manere
And torne I wille again to my matiere
The mooder of þe Sowdon welle of vices
Espied haþ hir sones pleyne entent
how he wol lete his olde Sacrifices
And right anon sche for hire counseil sent
And þei ben come to knowe what sche ment
And whan assembled was þis folk in feere  
Sche sette hire doun and seide as ye schal heere
 lordes quoþ sche ȝe knowen euerych on
how þat my sone in poynt is for to lete
The holy lawes of oure alkaron
yeuen by goddes messager Makomete
But oon avow to grete god I hete
The lyf schal rather out of my body sterte
Or makometis lawe out of myn herte
What scholde vs tyden of þis newe lawe
But þraldam to oure bodyes and penance
And afterward in helle to ben drawe
ffor we reneyed mahon oure creance
But lordes wol ye maken assurance
As I schal sein assentyng to my lore
And I schal make vs sauf for eueremore
 They sworen and assenten euery man
To lyue with hire and dye and by hire stonde
And euerich in þe beste wise he can
To strengþen hire schal alle his frendes fonde
And sche haþ þis emprise take on honde
Which ȝe schal here þat I schal deuyse
And to hem alle sche spak in þis wise
  
 We schulle ferst feyne vs cristendom to take
Cold water schal not greue vs but a lite
And I schal swich a reuel and feste maken
That as I trowe I schal þe soudon quite
ffor þough his wijf be cristened neuer so white
Sche schal haue neede to waissche away þe reede
Though sche a ffonte ful of water wiþ hire leede
 O soudanesse roote of Iniquite
Virago þou Semyram þe secounde
O serpent vnder femeninete
lik to þe serpent deepe in helle ybounde
O feyned womman al þat may confounde
Vertu and Innocence þorgh þy malice

 O Sathan envious syn þilke day
That þou were chased fro oure heritage
Wel knewestow to wommen þe olde way
Thow madest Eua to bringen in seruage
Thow wilt fordon cristene mariage
Thin Instrument so weylowey þe while
Makest þou of wommen whan þou wilt begile
 This Sowdanesse whom I þus blame and warie
leet priuely hire counseil gon here way
What schulde I in þis tale lenger tarye
Sche rideth to þe Sowdan on a day
And seide him þat sche wolde reneye hir lay
And cristendom of prestes handes fonge
Repentynge sche heþene was so longe
 Besekyng him to doon hire þat honour
That sche most han þe cristne folk to feste
To plesen hem I wol do my labour
The Sowdan seith I wil don at your heste
  
And knelyng þanketh hire of þat requeste
So glad he was he nyste what to seye
Sche kiste hir sone and hom sche goþ hir weye
 Arryued been þise cristene folk to londe
In Surrie with a gret solempne route
And hastiliche þis sowdan sent his sonde
ffirst to his mooder and alle þe regne aboute
And saide his wijf was come out of doute
And preyde hir for to ryde agein þe queene
The honour of his regne to susteene
 Gret was þe prees and riche was þarray
Of Surriens and Ramains met y feere
The mooder of þe Soudan riche and gay
Receyued hire with also glad a cheere
As any mooder might hir doughter deere
And to þe nexte Citee þer bisyde
A softe paas solempnely þei ryde
 Naught trowe I þe tryumphe of Iulius  
Of which þat lukan makeþ such a bost
Was riallere ne more curious
Than was thassemble of þis blisful oost
But þis scorpion this wikkede goost
The Sowdanesse for alle hir flateringe
Caste vnder þis ful mortally to stynge
 The Sowdan comeþ himself sone after þis
So really that wonder is to telle
he welcomeþ hire with alle ioye and blis
And þus in merthe and Ioye I lete hem dwelle
  
The fruyt of þis matiere þat I telle
Whan tyme come men þought it for þe best
That Reuel stynte and men gon to here Rest
 The tyme com þis olde Sowdanesse
Ordeyned haþ þis feeste of which I tolde
And to þe feste cristene folk hem dresse
In general boþe ȝonge and olde
here may men feste and rialte biholde
And deyntees mo þan I can ȝou deuyse
But all to deere þei bought it ar þey ryse
 O sodein woo þat euer art Successour
To worldly blysse spreynd is with bitternesse
The ende of þe ioye of oure worldly laboure
Wo occupieth þe fyn of oure gladnesse
herk þis counseille for þi sikernesse

The vnwar wo or harm þat comth behynde
ffor schortly for to tellen at oo word
The Sowdan and þe cristene euerychone
Ben al tohewe and stiked atte bord
But it were oonly dame Custance allone
This olde Sowdanesse cursede crone
haþ with hire freendes doon þis cursede dede
ffor sche hir self wolde alle þe contre lede
 Ne þer nas Surrian non þat was conuerted
That of þe counseil of þe Sowdan wot  
That he nas al tohewe or he asterted
And circumstance han þei take anon foot hoot
And in a Schippe al steereles god woot
Thay han hire sette and bidden hire lerne sayle
Out of Surrie agaynward to ytaile
  
 A certein tresour þat sche þider ladde
And soþ to sain vitaile gret plente
They han hire yeuen and cloþes eek sche hadde
And forþ sche saileþ in þe Salte see

 Sche blisseþ and with ful pitous vois

O cler o welful auter holy croys

That wisshe þe world fro þe olde iniquite

That day þat I schal drenchen in þe deepe

That oonly worþi were for to bere
The king of heuene with his woundes newe
The white lambe þat hurt was with a spere

On whych þi lymes feithfully entenden
Me keepe and yef me might my lijf tamenden

Thurgh out þe see of grece vnto þe strayte
Of Marrok as it was hire auenture

After hire deþ fulofte may sche wayte
Or þat þe wilde wawes wil hir dryue

 Men mighten  whi sche nas nat slayn
Eke atte feste who might hir body saue
I answere to þat demande agayn  
he saued daniel in þe horrible caue
  
Ther euery wight saue he maister or knaue
Was wiþ þe leon frete or asterte
No wight but god þat he bar in his herte
 God list to schewe his wonderful myracle
In hire for sche scholde seen his mighty werkes
Crist which þat is to euery harm triacle
By certein menes oft as knowen clerkes
Doþ þing for certein ende þat ful derk is
To mannes wit þat for oure ignorance
Ne konne nought knowe his prudent purueance
 Now siþ sche was not atte feste yslawe
Who kept hir fro þe drenching in þe see
Who kepte Ionas in þe fisshes mawe
Til he was spouted vp at Nyniue
Wel may men knowe it was no wight but he
That kepte pepul ebraik from here drenchyng
With drye feet þurgh out þe see passyng
 Who bad þe foure spiritz of tempest
That power han boþe to annoyen lond and see
Boþe north and south and also west and est
Anoyeþ neyþer see ne lond ne tree
Soþly þe comandour of þat was he
That fro þe tempest ay þis womman kepte
As wel whan sche wook as whan sche slepte
 Wher might þis womman mete and drynke haue
Three ȝeer and moore how lasteþ hire vitaille
Who fedde þe Egipcien marie in the Caue
Or in desert no wight but crist sanz faille
v þousand folk it was a gret meruaille
With loues fyue and fisshes tuo to feede
God sent his foyson at hire grete neede
  
 Sche driueþ forþ in to oure Occean
þurghout oure wilde see til atte last
vnder an hold þat nempnen I ne can
ffor in Northumburland þe wawe hir cast  
And in þe sond hir schippe stiked so fast
That þennes wold it nought of alle a tyde
The wille of crist was þat sche scholde abyde
 The Constable of þe castelle doun is fare
To seen þis wrak and alle þe schippe he sought
And fond þis wery womman ful of care
he fond also þe tresow þat sche brought
In hire langage mercy sche bisought
The lyf out of hir body for to twynne
hire to deliuere of wo þat sche was Inne
 A maner latyn corupt was hire speche
But algates þer by was sche vnderstonde
The constable whan him list no lengere seche
This woful womman brought he to þe londe
Sche kneeleth doun and þankeþ goddes sonde
But what sche was sche wolde no man seye
ffor foul ne fair þough þat sche scholde deye
 Sche seyde sche was so mased in þe see
That sche foryat hire mynde by hire trouþe
The constable of hire haþ so gret pite
And eek his wyf þat þei weepen for rouþe
Sche was so diligent wiþouten slouþe
To serue and plese euerich in þat place
That alle hire louen þat loken on hire face
 The constable and dame hermengheld his wif
Were payens and þat contray euery where
But hermyngeld loued hir right as hire lijf
And Custance haþ so longe soiorned þere
  
In orisons wiþ many a bitter teere
Til Ihesu haþ conuerted þurgh his grace
Dame hermyngeld constablesse of þilke place
 In alle þat land durste no cristene route
Alle cristene folk ben fled from þat contre
Thurgh payens þat conquereden heer aboute
The plages of þe north by land and see
To wales fledde þe cristianite  
Of olde britons dwellyng in þis Isle
There was hire refut  for þe meene while
 But yit nas neuer cristene britons so exiled
That þer nas somme in here priuyte
honourede crist and hethen folk bygiled
And neygh þe castelle swich þer dwelden þre
That oon of hem was blynd and might not se
But it were wiþ þilk eyen of his mynde
With whiche men seen after þat þai ben blynde
 Bright was þe sonne as in þat Someres day
ffor which þe Constable and his wyf also
And Custance han ytake þe righte way
Toward þe see a forlong weye or two
To pleyen and to Romen to and fro
And in here walk þre blynde men þey mette
Crokede and olde with fast eyen yschette
 In the name of crist criede þis blynde breton
dame hermyngild yeue me sight agayn
This lady wax affrayed of þe soun
lyst þat hir housbond schortly for to sein
Wolde hire for ihesu cristes loue haue slain
Til Custance made hire bold and made hire werche
The wille of crist as doughter of his cherch
  
 The Constable wax abaisshed of þat sight
And sayde what amounteþ al þis fare
Custance answerde sire it is cristes might
That helpeþ folk out of þe feendes snare
And so ferforth sche gan oure lay declare
That sche þe Constable or þat it was eue
Conuerteþ and on cryst made him bileeue
 This Constable was noþing lord of þis place
Of which I speke þere he Custance fond
But kepte it strongly many a wynter space
vnder alla kyng of all Northumberlond
þat was ful wys and worþy of his hond
Agayn þe Scottes as men may wel heere  
But torne I wil again to my mateere
 Sathan þat euer vs wayteth to begile
Saugh of Custance al hire perfection
And cast anon how he might quite her while
And made a yong knight þat dwelte in þe toun
loue hire so hoot of fowl affection
That verraily him þought he schulde spill
But he of hire might ones haue his wille
 he woweth hire but it auaileþ nought
Sche wolde do no synne by no weye
And for dispit he compassed in his þought
To make hir on schameful deþ to deye
he wayteþ whan þe Constable was aweye
And priuyly vpon a night he crept
In hermyngildes chambre whil sche slept
 Wery forwaked in his orisons
Slepeth Custance and hermenghild also
This knight þurgh Sathanas temptacions
Al softely is to þe bedde Igo
  
And kutte þe þrote of hermengild a tuo
And leyde þe blody knyf by dame Custance
And wente his wey þer god yeue him meschance
 Sone after comth þis constable hom a gayn
And eek Alla þat king was of þat lond
And saugh his wyf dispitousliche slain
ffor which ful ofte he wepte and wrong his hond
And in þe bed þe bloody knyf he fond
By dame Custance allas what might sche seye
ffo verray woo hir witte was alle aweye
 To king Alla was told al þis meschance
And eek þe tyme and wher and in what wise
That in a schip was founde þis Custance
As heer biforn ȝe han herd eer deuise
The kinges herte of pite gan agrise
Whan he seih so benigne a creature
ffalle in disese and in mysauenture  
 ffor as þe lomb toward his deth is brought
So stant þis Innocent bifore þe king
This false knight þat haþ þis trayson wrought
Bereþ hire an hand þat sche haþ do þis þing
But naþeles þer was gret mornyng
Among þe poeple and seye þay can not gesse
That sche hadde don so gret a wickednesse
 ffor þey han sein hir euer so vertuous
And louyng hermynghild right as hire lif
Of þis bar witnesse euerich in þat hous
Sauf he þat hermegild slough wiþ his knif
This gentil king haþ caught a gret motyf
Of þis witnesse and þought he wolde enquere
Deppere in þis cas a trouthe for to lere
  
 Allas Custance þou nast no champion
Ne fighte canst þou nought so weyloway
But he þat for oure redempcion
And bond Sathan and lith yet þer he lay
So be þy stronge champion þis day
ffor but vpon þe miracle kithe
Wiþouten gilt þou schalt ben slayn as swithe
 Sche sitte hir doun on knees and þus sche sayde
Immortal god þat sauedest Susanne
ffro false blame and þou merciful mayde
Marie I mene doughter to seint Anne
Biforn whos child aungelis synge Osanne
If I be gilteles of þis felonie
My socour be for elles schalt I dye
 haue ye not sein som tyme a pale face
Among a prees of him þat haþ be lad
Toward his deth wher as him get no grace
And swich a colour in his face haþ had
Men mighte knowe his face þat was bystad
Amonges alle þe faces in þat route
So stant Custance and loketh hire aboute
 O queenes lyuynge in prosperite  
Duchesses and ȝe ladies euerichone
haue som routhe on hir aduersite
An emperoures doughter stant allone
Sche haþ no wight to whom to make hir moone
O blood real þat stondest in þis drede
ffer been þi freendes at þy grete neede
 This alla king haþ such compassion
As gentil herte is fulfild of pite
That from his eyhen ran þe water don
Now hastilich do fecche a book quod he
  
And if þis knight wol swere how þat sche
This womman slough ȝit wol we vs auyse 
Whom þat we wolde þat schal be oure Iustise
 A briton book ywriten with euaungiles
Was fette and on þis book he swor anon
Sche giltif was in þe mene whiles
An hand him smot vpon þe nekke bon
That doun he felle at ones as a stoon
And boþe his eyen brust out of his face
In sight of euery body in þat place
 A vois was herd in general audience
And seyde þou hast disclandred gilteles
The doughter of holy chirche in heigh presence
Thus hast þou doon and ȝet I moot holde my pees
Of þis merueyle agast was alle þe prees
As mzed folk þei stooden euerychone
ffor drede of wreche saue Custance allone
Gret was þe drede and eek þe repentance
Of hem þat hadden wrong suspecion
vpon þis seely Innocent Custance
And for þis miracle in conclusion
And by Custance mediacion
The king and many anoþer in þat place
Conuerted was þanked be goddes grace
 This false knight was slain for his vntrouthe
By Iuggement of alla hastily  
And yet Custance haþ of his deth gret rouþe
And after þis ihesus of his mercy
Made Alla wedden ful solempnely
This holy mayden þat is so bright and scheene
And þus haþ Crist made Custance a queene
  
 But who was woful if I schul nat lye
Of þis wedding but Donegilde and nomo
The kinges mooder ful of tyrannye
hir þought hir cursed herte barst a two
Sche wolde nought hir sone hadde don so
hir þought a despit þat he schulde take
So strange a creature vnto his make
 Me list nouȝt of þe chaf ne of þe stre
Make so long a tale as of þe corn
What schulde I tellen of þe realte
Of mariage or which cours goþ biforn
Who bloweþ in a trompe or in an horn
The fruyt of euery tale is for to seie
Thei ete and drynke and daunce and synge and pleye
They gon to bedde as it was skile and right
ffor þough þat wyfes ben ful holy þinges
They moste take a pacience a night
Such manere necessaries as ben plesynges
To folk þat han ywedded hem wiþ rynges
And leye a litel here holynesse asyde
As for þe time it may non oþer betyde
 On hire he gat a knaue child anon
And to a bisshope and his counseil eeke
he took his wijf to kepe whan he is goon
To Scotland ward his fomen for to seeke
Now faire Custance þat is so humble and meeke
So longe is gon wiþ childe til þat stille
Sche halt hir chambre abydyng at cristes wille
 The tyme is come a knaue child sche beer
Mauricius atte font ston þei him calle
This Constable doþ forþ come a messagere  
And wrot to his king þat cleped was alle
  
how þat þis blisful tyding is bifalle
And oþer tydynges spedful for to seye
he takeþ þe lettre and forth he goþ his weye
 This messager to don his auantage
vnto þe kinges moder rideþ swiþe
And salueth hire ful faire in his langage
Ma dame quoþ he ȝe may be glad and bliþe
And thanke god an hundred þousand siþe
My lady queen haþ child wiþouten doute
To Ioye and blisse of alle þis regne aboute
 lo here þe lettres seled of þis þing
That I mot bere with al þe haste I may
If ye wole aught vnto your sone þe king
I am your seruant boþe night and day
Dongyld answerd as now at þis tyme nay
But heer al night I wole þou take þi rest
Tomorwe wil I seie what me lest
 This messager drank sadly ale and wyn
And stolen weren his lettres priuyly
Out of his box whil he sleep as a swyn
And counterfeted was ful subtilly
Anoþer lettre wrought ful synfully
vnto þe king direct of þis matiere
ffro his Conestable as ȝe schal after heere
The lettre spak þe queen deliuered was
Of so horrible a feendlich creature
That in þe Castelle non so hardy was
That ony while dorste þerinne endure
The mooder was an elf by auenture
ycome by charmes or by sorcerie
And euery wight hateþ hire companye
  
Wo was þis king whan he þis lettre hadde seyn
But to no wight he tolde his sorwes sore
But of his oughne hond he wrot ageyn
Welcome þe sonde of crist for eueremore  
To me þat am now lerned in his lore
lord welcome be þi lust and þi plesance
My lust is put al in þin ordinance
 kepeth þis child al be it foul or faire
And eek my wif vnto myn hom comyng
Crist whan him list may sende me an haire
More agreable þan þis is to my liking
This lettre he seleþ priuyly wepyng
Which to þe messager was take sone
And forth he goþ þer is nomore to doone
 O messager fulfild of dronkenesse 
Strong is þi breþ þi lymes faltren ay
And þou biwreyest alle sikernesse 
Thy mynde is lorn þou iangelest as a Iay
Thy face is torned in a newe aray
Ther dronkenesse regneþ in ony route
Ther nys no counseil hid wiþouten doute
 O donegild I haue non englissh digne
vnto þy malice and þy tyrannye
And þerfore to þe feend I þe resigne 
lat him enditen of þi traiterie 
ffy mannyssh fy o nay by god I lye
ffy feendlich spirit for I dar wel telle
Though þou here walke þy spirit is in helle 
 This messager comþ fro þe king agayn
And at þe kinges moodres court he light
And sche was of þis messager ful fain
And plesed him in al þat euer sche might
  
he drank and wel his gerdel vnderpight
he sleepeþ and he snorteþ in his gyse
Al night til þe sonne gan arise
 Eft were his lettres stolen euerich on
And countrefeted lettres in þis wise
The king comandeþ his constable anon
vp peyne of hangyng on a heih Iuyse
That he ne schulde suffre in no wise  
Custance in with his Regne for tabide
Thre dayes and a quarter of a tyde
 But in þe same schip as he hire fond
hire and hire ȝonge sone and alle hir gere
he schulde putte and croude fro þe londe
And charge hire þat sche neuer eft come þere
O my Custance wel may þi goost haue feere
And sleping in þi drem ben in penaunce
Whan Donegild caste al þis ordinance
 This messager on morwe whan he wook
Vnto þe castel halt þe nexte way
And to þe Constable he þe lettre took
And whan þat he þis pitous lettre say
fful ofte he seyde allas and weylaway
 lord crist quod he how may þis lettre endure
So ful of synne is many a creature
 O mighty god if þat it be þi wille
Sith þou art rightful Iuge how may it be
That þou wolt suffren Innocentz to spille
And wikke folk regnen in prosperite
 O goode Custance allas so wo is me
That I moot be þi tormentour or deye
On schames deþ þer is non oþer weye
  
 Wepen boþe ȝonge and olde in al þat place
Whan þat þe king þis cursede lettre sente
And Custance with a dedly pale face
The ferþe day toward hir schip sche wente
But naþeles sche takeþ in good entente
The wille of crist and knelyng in þe stronde
Sche seyde lord ay welcome be þi sonde
he þat me kepte fro þe false blame
Whil I was on þe lond amonges yow 
he kan me kepe from harm and eek fro schame
In salte see al þough I se not how
As strong as euer he was he is right now 
In him trust I and in his mooder deere  
That is to me my sail and eek my steere
hir litel child lay weepyng in hire arm
And knelyng pitously to him sche seide
Pees litel sone I wol do þe non harm
Wiþ þat hir couerchef of hir heed sche breyde
And ouer his litel eyȝen sche it leyde
And in hir arm sche lulleth it ful faste 
And in to heuen hir yhen vp sche caste
 Moder quod sche and mayde bright marie
Soth is þat þurgh wommannes eggement
Mankynde was lorn and dampned ay to deye
ffor which þi child was on a croys yrent
Thy blisful eighen saugh al his torment
Than is þer no comparison bitwene
Thy wo and any wo man may sustene
 Thou saugh þi sone yslayn biforn þin eyen
And ȝit now lyueþ my litel child par fay
Now lady bright to whom alle woful cryen
Thow glorie of wommanhod þou faire may
  
Thou hauen of refut brighte sterre of day
Rewe on my child þat of þi gentilesse
Rewest on euery rewful in distresse
 O litel child allas what is þi gilt
That neuer wroughtest synne as ȝit par de
Why wil þin harde fader haue þe spilt
O mercy deere Conestable quod sche
As lat my litel child dwelle heer with þe
And if þou darst nought sauen him for blame
So kisse him ones in his fadres name
 Ther with sche lokeþ bakward to þe lond
And sayde farewel housbonde routheles
And vp sche rist and walketh doun þe stronde
Toward þe schip hir folweþ alle þe prees
And euer sche preieþ hir child to holde his pees
And takeþ hire leeue and with an holy entent
Sche blisseþ hire and in to schip sche wente  
vitailled was þe schip it is no drede
habundauntly for hire ful longe space
And oþer necessaries þat scholden neede
Sche hadde ynough heried be goddes grace
ffor wynd and weder almighty god purchace
And brynge hir home I can no better sey
But in þe see sche dryueþ forþ hir wey
Alla þe king comþ hom sone after þis 
vnto his castelle of þe which I tolde
And axeþ wher his wyf and his child is
The Constable gan aboute his herte colde
  
And pleynly al þe maner he him tolde
As ye han herd I can telle it no bettre
And scheweth þe king his seal and his lettre
And seyde lord as ȝe comaunded me
vp peyne of deth so haue I don certein
This messager tormented was til he
Moste biknowen and tellen plat and plein
ffrom night to night in what place he hadde leyn
And þus by witt and subtil enqueryng
ymagined was by whom þis harm gan spring
 The hond was knowe þat þe lettre wrot
And alle þe venym of þe cursed dede
But in what wise certeinly I not
The effect is þis þat alla out of drede
his mooder slough þat many men pleynly reede
ffor þat sche traitour was to hire ligeance 
Thus endeþ olde Donegild wiþ meschance
The sorwe þat þis Alla night and day
Makeþ for his wyf and for his child
Ther is no tonge þat it telle may
But now wol I vnto Custance go
That fleeteþ in þe see in peyne and wo
v yeer and more as likede cristes sonde
Ar þat hire schip approched vnto londe
 Vnder an heþen castelle atte laste  
Of which þe name in my text nouȝt I fynde
Custance and eek hir childe þe see vp caste
Almighty god þat saueþ al mankynde
haue on Custance and hir child som mynde
That fallen is in hethene hond eft sone
In poynt to spille as I schal telle yow soone
  
Doun fro þe Castelle comþ þer many a wight
To gawren on þis schip and on Custance
But schortly fro þe castel on a night
The lordes styward god yeue him meschance
A theef þat hadde renyed oure creance 
Com in to schip allone and seide he scholde
hir lemman be wher so sche wolde or nolde
 Wo was þis wrecchede womman þo bigon
hir child cryede and sche cried pitously
But blisful marie halp hir right anoon
ffor with hir strogelyn wel and mightily
The theef fel ouer bord al sodeinly
And in þe see he dreynte for vengance
And þus haþ crist  vnwemmed kept Custance
O foule lust of luxurie lo þin ende
Nought  oonly þat þou fayntest mannes mynde
But verreyly þou wolt his body schende
The ende of þi werk or of þi lustes blynde
Is compleynyng how many oon may men fynde
That nought for werk somtyme but for þentent
To don þis synne ben eyþer slayn or schent
 how may þis weyke womman han þe strengþe
hire to defende ageyn þis renegat
O golyas vnmesurable of lengþe
how mighte Dauid make þe so mat
So yonge and of armure so desolat
how dorst he loke vpon þi dredful face
Wel may men sen it was but goddes grace
Who yaf Iudith corage or hardynesse
To slen him Olefernus in his tent  
And to delyueren out of wrecchednesse
The poeple of god I sey for þis entent
  
þat right as god spirit and vigor sent
To hem and saued hem out of meschance
So sent he might and vigor to Custance
fforþ goþ hir schip forþ on þe narwe mouth
Of Iubaltar and Septe dryuyng ay
Somtyme west and som tyme north and south
And som tyme est ful many a wery day
Til cristes mooder blissed be sche ay
haþ schapen þurgh hir endeles goodnesse
To make an ende of alle hir heuynesse
 Now lat vs stynte of Custance but a þrowe
And speke we of þe Romeyn Emperour
That out of Surrie haþ þe lettres knowe
The slaughtere of cristene folk and deshonour
Don to his doughter by a fals traytour
I mene þe cursede wickede Sowdonesse
That at þe feste let slen boþe more and lesse
 ffor which þis Emperour haþ sent anon
his senatour wiþ real ordinance
And oþer lordes god wot many on
On Surriens to taken his vengance
They brennen sleen and bringen hem to meschānce
fful many a day but schortly þis is þende
homward to Rome þei schapen hem to wende
This Senatour repaireth with victorie
To Romeward saylinge really
And mette þe schip dryuyng as seiþ þe storie
In which Custance sitte ful pitously
No þing ne knew he what sche was ne why
Sche was in swich aray ne sche nyl seye
Of hire astate þough sche scholde deye
  
he bringeþ hire to Rome and to his wijf
he yaf hire and hire ȝonge sone also
And wiþ þe Senatour sche ladde hir lyf  
Thus kan oure lady bringen out of woo
Woful Custance and many anoþer mo
And long tyme dwelled sche in þat place
In holy werkes euere as was hir grace
 The Senatoures wijf hir aunte was
But for al þat sche knew hir neuer þe more
I wil no lenger tarien in þis caas
But to king Alla which I spak of yore
That for his wyf wepeþ and sikeþ sore 
I wol retorne and lete I wil Custance
vnder þe Cenatoures gouernance 
 kyng Alla which þat hadde his moder slayn
vpon a day fil in such repentance
That if I schortly tellen schal and playn
To Rome he comeþ to receyuen his penance
And put him in þe popes ordinance
In heigh and low and Ihesu crist besoughte
fforyeue his wikkede werkes þat he wroughte
 The fame ano þurgh Rome toun is born
how Alla king schal comen in pilgrinage
By herberiours þat wenten him biforn
ffor which þe Senatour as was vsage
Rood him agayn and many of his lynage
As wel to schewen his hie magnificence
As to don any king a reuerence
 Gret cheere doth þis noble Senatour
To king Alla and he to him also
Euerich of hem doþ oþer gret honour
And so bifille þat in a day or tuo
  
This Senatour is to king alla go
To feeste and schortly if I schal not lye
Custance sone is in his companye 
 Som men wolde seyn atte requeste of Custance
This Senatour haþ lad þis child to feste
I may not tellen euerich circumstance 
Be as be may þer was he atte leste  
But soþ is þis þat at his moodres heste
Byforn Alla duryng þe metes space
The child stood loking in þe kinges face
This alla king haþ of þe child gret wonder
And to þe Senatour he sayde anon
Whos is þat faire child þat stondeþ yonder
I not quod he by god and by seint Iohn
A mooder he haþ but fader haþ he non
That I of woot and schortly in a stounde 
he tolde alla how þat þis child was founde
 But god wot quod þis Senatour also
So vertuous a lyuere in my lyf
Ne saugh I neuer as sche ne herde of mo
Of worldly wommen mayde ne of wijf
I dar wel sayn sche hadde leuer a knyf
Thurghout hire brest þan ben a womman wikke
Ther is noman kowde bringe hire to þat prikke
Now was þis child as lik vnto Custance 
As possible as is a creature to be
This alla haþ þe face in remembrance
Of dame Custance and þer on mused he
If þat þe childes moder were aught sche 
That is his wyf and priuily he sighte
And spedde him fro þe table þat he mighte
  
 Par fay he þought þe fantome is in myn hed
I oughte demen of skilful Iuggement
That in þe salte see my wyf is deed
And aftirward he made his argument
What wot I if þat crist haþ hider sent
My wyf by see as wel as he hir sente
To my contre fro þennes þat sche wente
 And after non hom with þe Senatour
Goþ alla for to seen þis wonder chaunce
This Senatour doþ alla gret honour
And hastily he sente after Custance
But trusteþ wel hire luste nought to daunce  
Whan þat sche wiste wherfore was þat sonde
Vnneþe vppon hire feet sche mighte stonde 
 Whan alla saugh his wyf faire he hire grette 
And wepte þat it was reuþe for to se
ffor atte ferste look he on hire sette 
he knew wel verrely þat it was sche 
and for sorwe as domb stant as a tre
So was hir herte schet in hire distresse
Whan sche remembred his vnkyndenesse 
 Twies sche swowneþ in his owne sight
he wepte and him excuseth pitously
Now god quod he and his halwes bright
So wisly on my saule as haue mercy
That of youre harm as gilteles am I
As is Maurice my sone so lik ȝoure face
Elles the feende me fecche out of þis place 
 longe was þe sobbyng and þe bittre peyne 
Or þat here wofulle hertes mighte cesse 
Gret was þe pite for to heere hem pleyne 
þurgh whiche pleyntes gan hire wo encresse 
  
I pray ȝou alle my labour to relesse
I may not tellen hir wo vntil to morwe
I am so wery for to speke of hire sorwe
 But finally whan þat þe soþe is wist
That Alla gilteles was of hire woo 
I trowe an hundred tymes ben þei kiste
And such a blisse is þer betwixe hem tuo
That saue þe ioye þat lasteth eueremo
Ther is non lik þat ony creature
haþ seyn or schal whil þe world may dure
 Tho preyed sche hire housbonde mekely
In relief of hir longe pitous pyne
That he wolde preye hire fader specially
That of his mageste he wolde enclyne
To fouche sauf som day with him to dyne
Sche preyde him eek he scholde by no weye  
vnto hir fader no word of hire seye
 Some men wolde sein how þat þe child Maurice
Doþ þis message vntil þis Emperour
But as I gesse Alla was nought so nyce
To him þat was of so souereigne honour
As he þat is of cristene folk þe flour
Sent eny child but it is bet to deme
he went himself and so it may wel seme
 This Emperour hath graunted gentily
To come to dyner as he him bysought
And wel redy he lokede bisily
vpon þis child and on his doughter þought
Alla goþ to his In and as him ought
Arrayed for þis feste in euery wise
As ferforth as his konnyng may suffise
  
 The morwe com and alla gan him dresse
And eek his wyf þis Emperour to meete
And forþ þey ryde in ioye and in gladnesse 
And whan sche seigh hir fader in þe strete
Sche light a doun and falleþ him to feet
ffader quod sche youre ȝonge child Custance
Is now ful clene out of ȝoure remembrance
 I am ȝoure doughter Custance quod sche
That whilom ye sent vnto Surrye
I am I fader þat in þe salte see
Was putte allone and dampned for to dye
Now goode fader mercy to you I crye
Send me nomore vnto non hethenesse
But þonk my lord heer of his kyndenesse
 Who can þe pitous Ioye tellen al
Bitwexe hem þre syn þey ben þus ymette
But of my tale make an ende I schal
The day goþ faste I wol no lenger lette
This glad folk to dyner þey hem sette
In ioye and blisse at mete I lete hem dwelle
A þousand fold wel more þan I can telle   
This child maurice was sitthen Emperour
Made by þe pope and lyuede cristenely
To cristes chirche he dede gret honour
But I letete alle his story passen by
Of Custance is my tale specially
In olde Romeyn gestes men may fynde
Maurices lyf I bere it nought in mynde
 This king Alla whan he his tyme say
With his Custance his holy wif so sweete
To Engelond þei come þe redy way
Wher as þay lyue in ioye and in quiete
  
But litel while it lasteþ I ȝou heete
Ioye of þis world for tyme wil nouȝt abyde
ffro day to nyght it chaungeþ as þe tyde
 Who lyued euere in such delyt a day
That ne meued eyþer conscience 
Or Ire or talent of som kyn affray
Enuye or pride or passion or offense 
I ne say but for þis ende þis sentence
That litel while in Ioye or in plesance
lasteþ þe blisse of alla wiþ Custance 
ffor deþ þat takeþ of heigh and lough his rent
Whan passed was a yeer euene as I gesse
Out of þis world þis king Alla he hent
ffor whom Custance haþ ful gret heuynesse 
Now lat vs prayen god his soule blesse 
And dame Custance finally to seye
Toward þe toun of Rome goþ hire weye
To Rome is come þis holy creature
And fyndeþ hire freendes hol and sounde
Now is sche scaped alle hire auenture
And whan sche hir fader haþ Ifounde
Doun on hir knees falleth sche to grounde
Wepynge for tendirnesse in herte bliþe
Sche herieþ god an C þousand sithe
In vertue and holy almesdede   
They lyuen alle and neuer asonder wende
Til deth departe hem þis lif þey lede
And fareþ now wel my tale is at an ende
Now ihesu crist þat of his might may sende
Ioye after wo gouerne vs in his grace
And kepe vs alle þat ben in þis place 
Owre oost vpon his stiropes stood anoon
And seyde goode men herkeneþ euerych on
This was a thrifty tale for þe nones
Sire parissche prest quod he for goddes boones
Telle vs a tale as was þi forward yore
I se wel þat ye lerned men in loore
Can moche good by goddes dignete
The parson him answerde benedicite
What eyleþ þe man so synfully to swere 
Oure ost answerde O Ianekyn be ye þere
I smelle a lollere in þe wynd quod he
how goode men quod oure host herkeneþ me
Abydeþ for goddes digne passion
ffor we schal han a predicacion
This lollere heer wil prechen vs som what
Nay by my fader soule þat schal he nat
Seyde þe Esquier heer schal he nat preche
He schal no gospel glosen here ne teche
he leueþ all in þe grete god he
he wolde sowen som difficulte
Or springen Cokkel in oure clene corn
And þerfore oost I warne þe biforn
My Ioly body schal a tale telle
And I schal clynken ȝou so mery a belle
That I schal waken al þis compaignie
But it schal not ben of philosophie
Ne Phislyas ne termes queinte of lawe
Ther is but litel latyn in my nawe
AT Sarray in þe land of Tartarye  
Ther dwelt a king þat werreyed Russye
Thurgh which þer deyed many a doughty man
This noble king was cleped kambynskan
Which in his tyme was of so gret renon
That þer nas nowher in no region
So excellent a lord in alle þing
him lacked nought þat longed to a kyng
As of þe secte of which þat he was born
he kepte his lay to which þat he was sworn
And þerto he was hardy wys and riche
And pitous and Iust alwey yliche
Soþ of his word benigne and honorable
Of his corage as eny centre stable
yong freissh and strong in armes desirous
As eny bacheler of alle his hous
A fair persone he was and fortunat
And kepte alway so wel real astat
That þer nas no wher swich anoþer man
This noble king this Tartre Kambynskan
hadde tuo sones in Eltheta his wyf
Of which þe eldest highte Algarsyf
That oþer was ycleped Camballo
A doughter hadde þis worþy king also
That yongest was and highte Canace
But for to telle you al hire beaute
It lyþ nought in my tonge ne in my konnyng
I dar not vndertake so heigh a þing
  
Myn englissch eek is insufficient
It moste ben a Rethor excellent
That couþe his colours longyng for þat art
If he schulde hir discryue in any part
I am non swich I moot speke as I can
And so bifelle that whan þis Cambynskan
haþ twenty wynter born his Diademe
As he was wonte fro yeer to yeer I deeme
he leet þe feste of his natiuite  
Don cryen þurgh Sarray his Cite
The laste Idus of March after þe ȝeer
Phebus þe sonne Iolif was and cleer
ffor he was neigh his exaltacion
In martes face and his mansion
In aries þe Colerik þe hote signe
fful lusty was þe weder and benigne
ffor which þe foules aȝein þe sonne sshene
What for þe seson and þe yonge grene
fful loude songe hire affections
hem semed han geten hem protections
Aȝėin þe swerd of wynter keene and cold
This Kambynskan of which I haue ȝou told
In Real vestiment sit on his deys
With dyademe ful heigh in his paleys
And halt his feste solempne and so riche
That in þis world ne was þer non it liche
Of which if I schal telle al þe array
Than wold it occupye a someres day
And eek it needeþ nat to deuyse
At euery cours þe ordre of here seruise
I wol not tellen of here straunge sewes
Ne of here swannes ne of here heronsewes
Ek in þat lond as tellen knightes olde
Ther is som mete þat is ful deynte holde
That in þis lond men recche but smal
Ther nys no man þat may reporten al
  
I wol not tarien yow for it is prime
And for it is no fruyt but los of tyme
vnto my first purpos I wole haue my recours 
And so bifelle þat after þe þridde cours
Whil þat þis king sit þus in his nobleye
herknyng his menstreles here þinges pleye
Biforn him atte bord deliciously
In atte halle dore al sodeinly
Ther com a knight vpon a steede of bras  
And in his hond a brood Mirour of glas
vpon his thombe he hadde of gold a ryng
And by his syde a naked swerd hangyng
And vp he rydeþ to þe heihe bord
In alle þe halle ne was þer spoke a word
ffor merueille of þis knight him to biholde
fful bysyly þey wayten ȝonge and olde 
This strange knight þat com þus sodeynly
Al armed saue his heed ful richely
Salued þe king and queen and lordes alle
By ordre as þey seten in þe halle
with so heigh reuerence and obeissances
As wel in speche as in contenances
That Gawayn with his olde curtesye 
Though he com agayn out of fayrie 
Ne couþe him nought amende wiþ no word
And after þis bifore þe heihe bord
he with a manly vois sayde his message
After þe forme vsed in his langage
wiþoute vice of Sillable or of lettre
And for his tale scholde seme þe bettre
Acordant to his wordes was his chere 
As techeþ art of speche hem þat it lere 
Al be it þat I can nat sowne his stile
Ne can not clymben ouer so heigh a style
yet seye I þis þat as to commune entente
Thus moche amounteþ al þat euer he mente
  
If it so be þat I haue it in my mynde
he seyde þe king of Arabie and of Inde
My liege lord on þis solempne day
Salueþ ȝou as he best can and may
And sendeþ yow in honour of your feste
By me þat am redy at al your heste 
This steede of Bras þat esily and wel
kan in þe space of a day naturel
This is to seie in xxiiijti houres  
Wher so yow list in droughte or in schoures
Beren youre body in to euery place 
To which youre herte wilneth for to pace
wiþoute wem of ȝou þorugh foul or fair
Or if ȝou list to flee as hye in þair
As doþ an Egle whan him list to sore
This same steede schal bere ȝou eueremore
wiþouten harm til ye be þer you leste
Though þat ȝe slepen on his bak or reste
And torne aȝayn wiþ wryþing of a pyn
he þat it wroughte couþe ful many a gyn
he waitede many a constellacōn
Or he hadde do þis operaciōn
And knew ful many a seal and many a bond
This Mirour eek þat I haue in myn hond
haþ such a might that men may in it see
whan þer schal fallen any aduersite
Vnto youre regne or to your self also
And openly who is ȝour frend or foo
And ouer al þis if ony lady bright
haþ set hire herte on any maner wight
If he be fals sche schal his trayson se
his newe loue and al his subtilite
So openly þat þer schal no þing hyde
wherfore ageyn þis lusty somer tyde
This mirour and þis ryng as ye may see 
he haþ sent to my lady Canacee
  
youre excellent doughter þat is heere
The vertu of þis ring if ȝe wol heere
Is þis þat if hir list it for to were 
vpon hir þombe or in hir purs it bere
Ther is no foule þat fleigh vnder þe heuene
þat she ne schal vnderstonde his steuene
And knowe his menyng openly and pleyn
And answere him in his langage ageyn
And euery gras þat groweþ vpon a roote   
Sche schal wel knowe and whom it wol do boote
Al be his woundes neuer so deepe and wyde
This naked swerd þat hongeth by my syde
Swich vertu haþ þat what man so ye smyte
Thurghout his armour it wole kerue and byte
Were it as þikke as is a braunched oke
And what man þat is wounded wiþ þe stroke
Schal neuer be hol til þat yow list of grace
To stroke him wiþ þe plat in þilke place
Ther he is hurt þis is as moche to sayn
ye moote with þe platte swerd agayn
Stroke him on þe wounde and it wil close
This is a verray soth wiþouten glose
It failleþ nought whiles it is in youre hold
And whan þis knight haþ þus his tale told
he rydeth out of þe halle and doun he light
his steede which þat schon as sonne bright
Stant in þe court stille as ony stoon
This knight in to his chambre is lad anoon
And is vnarmed and to þe mete yset
The presentes ben ful richely yfet
This is to sein þe swerd and þe mirour
And born anon vnto þe hihe tour
Wiþ certein officers ordeyned þerfore
And vnto Canacee þe ryng is bore
Solempnely þer sche sitt atte table
But sikerly wiþouten eny fable 
  
The hors of bras þat may nat be remewed
It stant as it were to þe ground yglewed
Ther may noman out of þe place it dryue
ffor non engyn of wyndas or polyue 
And cause why for þey can nouȝt þe craft
And þerfore in the place þei han it laft
Til þat þe knight haþ taught hem þe maneere
To voyden him as ȝe schal after heere
Gret was þe prees þat swarmed to and fro  
To gauren on þis hors þat stondeþ so
ffor it so heih was and so brood and long
So wel proporciouned for to be strong
Right as it were a steede of lumbardye
Ther with so horsly and so quyk of ye
As it a gentil poyleys courser were
ffor certes fro his tail vnto his eere
Nature ne art ne couþe him nought amende
In no degre as al þe poeple wende
But euermore here mooste wonder it was
how þat it cowde gon and was of Bras
It was of ffaierye as þe peple semede
diuerse folk diuersely han demede
As many heedes as many wittes þer been
They murmerede as don a swarm of been
And maden skyles after here fantasyes
Rehersyng of þe olde poetries
And seyden it was lik þe Pagasee
The hors þat hadde wynges for to flee
Or elles it was þe Grekes hors Synon
That broughte troye to destruction
As men in þise olde gestes reede
Myn herte quod oon is eueremore in drede
I trowe som men of armes ben þer Inne
That schapen hem þis cite for to wynne
It were right good þat alle swich þing were knowe
Anoþer rowned to his felawe lowe
  
And seyde he lyeth for it is raþere lik
An apparence ymaad by som magyk
As Iogelours pleyen at þese festes grete 
Of sondry þoughtes þus þey Iangle and trete
As lewed peple demeþ communly
Of þinges þat been more maad subtily
Than þey can in here lewednesse comprehende 
They demen gladly to þe baddere ende
And some of hem wondren on þe mirour  
That born was vp vnto þe maistre tour
how men might in it suche þinges se
Anoþer answerde and seyde it might wel be
Naturelly by composicions
Of aungels and of sleygh reflexions
And seyde þat in Rome was such oon
They speke of alocen and vitilion
And of aristotle þat writen in here lyues
Of queinte mirours and of perspectyues
As knowen þey þat han here bookes herde
And oþer folk han wondred on þe swerde
That wolde perce þurgh euery þing
And fille in speche of Thelophus þe king
And of achilles for his queinte spere 
ffor he couþe with it boþe hele and dere 
Right in swich wise as men may wiþ þe swerd
Of which right now ye haue youre seluen herd
They speken of sondry hardyng of metalle
And speke of medicynes þer wiþalle
And how and whanne it scholde harded be
Which is vnknowe algate vnto me 
Tho speeke þey of Canaces ryng
And seyden alle þat swich a wonder þing
Of craft of rynges herde þey neuere non
Saue þat he moyses and king Salomon
hadde a name of konnyng in swich art
Thus seyen þe peple and drawen hem a part
  
But naþeles somme seyde þat it was
Wonder to maken of fern aisshen glas
And ȝit is glas not lik aisshen of fern
But for þey han knowen it so fern
Therfore ceseþ here Ianglyng and here wonder
As sore wondren some on cause of þonder
On ebbe and flood on gossomer and on myst 
And alle þing til þe cause is wist  
Thus Ianglen þei and demen and deuyse
Til þat þe king gan fro his bord arise
 Phebus haþ laft þe angle meridional
And ȝit ascendyng was þe best roial
The gentil leon wiþ his Aldrian
Whan þat þis Tartre kyng Kambynskan
Ros from his bord ther as he sat ful hye
Biforn him goþ þe lowde menstralcie 
Til he com to his chambre of paramentz
Ther as þey sownen diuerse instrumentz
That is lik an heuene for to heere 
Now dauncen lusty venus children deere
ffor in þe fisshe hir lady sat ful hye
And lokeþ on hem with a freendy yhe
This noble king is set vp on his troone
This straunge knight is fet to him ful sone 
And on þe daunce he goþ with Canacee
here is þe reuel and þe Iolite
That is nat able a dul man to deuyse 
he moste han knowe loue and his seruise 
And ben a festlich man as freisch as may
That scholde ȝow deuisen such array
who couþe telle yow þe forme of daunces
So vncouthe and such freissche continaunces
Swich subtile lokynges and dissimulynges
ffor drede of Ialouseye mennes aperceyuynges
Noman but lancelet and he is deed
Therfore I passe ouer al þis lustyhed
  
I say nomore but in þis Iolynesse
I lete hem til men to soper hem dresse
The stiward bit spices for to hye
And eek þe wyn in al þis melodye
The vssheres and þe squyers ben ygon
The spices and þe wyn is come anon
They eete and dronke and whan þis hadde an ende
vnto þe temple as resoun was þey wende  
 The seruise doon þey soupen al by day
What needeþ you rehersen here aray
Ech man woot wel þat at a kinges feste
haþ plente to þe meste and to þe leste
And deyntees mo þan ben in my knowyng
And after souper goþ þis noble king
To seen þis hors of bras wiþ al a route
Of lordes and of ladyes him aboute
Swich wondryng was þer on þis hors of bras
That siþþen þe grete seege of Troye was
Ther as men wondren on an hors also
Ne was þer swich a wondryng as was þo 
But finally þe king askeþ þe knight
The vertue of þis courser and þe might
And preyde him to telle his gouernance
The hors anon bigan to trippe and daunce
Whan þat þis knight layde hond vpon his reyne 
And seyde sire þer is namore to seyne
But whan þou list to ryden eny where
ye moote trille a pyn stant in his eere
which I schal telle you bitwen vs tuo 
ye moot nempne him to what place also
Or to what Contre þat yow list to ryde
And whan ye come þer as yow list tabyde
Bid him descende and trille anoþer pyn
ffor þerin liþ þeffect of al þat gyn
And wole doun descende and don your wille
And in þat place he wol abyde stille
  
þeigh alle þe world hadde þe contrarie swore
he schal not þennes be þrowe ne ybore
Of if yow liste bidde him þennes gon
Trille þis pynne and he wil vanyssche anon
Out of þe sight of euery maner wight
And come ayein be it day or night
whan þat yow list to clepen him agayn
In swich a gyse as I schal to yow sayn  
Bitwixen yow and me and þat ful soone
Ryd whan yow list þer is no more to doone
Enformed whan þe kyng was of þe knight
And haþ conceyued in his witt aright
The maner and þe forme of alle þis þing
fful glad and bliþe þe noble doughty kyng
Repeyryng to his reuel as biforn
The brydel is in to þe tour yborn
And kept among his Ieweles lief and diere
The hors vanyssht y not in what manere
Out of here sight ye gete namore of me
But þus I lete in lust and Iolite
This Kambynskan his lordes festeynge
Til wel neigh þe day bigan to springe
 The norice of digestion is slepe
Gan on hem wynke and bad hem take kepe
That moche mete and labour wol haue reste 
And with a galpyng hem alle he keste 
And seyde þat it was tyme to lye a doun
ffor blood was in his dominacion
Cherissheþ blood natures frend quod he
þey þanken him galpynge by tuo by þre
And euery wight gan drawen him to his reste
As sleep hem bad þey tooke it for þe beste
  
here dremes schulle not mowe be told for me
fful were here heedes of fumosite
That causeþ drem of which þer is no charge 
They sleepen til it was pryme large 
The moste part but it were Canace
Sche was ful mesurable as wommen be
ffor of hire fader hadde sche take hir leeue
To go to reste sone after it was eue
hir list not appalled for to be
ffor on þe morwe vnfestlich for to see 
And slepte hir ferste sleep and awok  
ffor swich a ioye sche in hir herte took
Boþe of hire queynte ryng and hire mirour
That twenty tyme sche chaungeth hire colour
And in hire sleep right for impression
Of hire mirour sche hadde a vision
Wherfore ar þat þe sonne vp gan glyde
Sche cleped vp on hire maystresse bysyde
And seyde þat hir liste for to arise
Thise olde wommen þat ben gladly wyse
As is hire maystresse answerde anon
And seyde ma dame whider wolde ye gon
Thus erely for folk ben alle in reste
I wole quod sche arise for me leste 
No lengere sleepen but walken aboute
hire maistresse clepeþ wommen a gret route 
And vp þey risen wel ten or twelue
vp riseþ freisshe Canace hir selue
As rody as bright as þey þe yonge sonne
That in þe Ram is ten degrees vpronne
Non hiher was he whan sche redy was
And forth sche walkede eesyly a pas
Arrayed after þe lusty seson soote
lightly for to pleye and walke on foote
Nat but v or vj of hire meyne
And in a trench fer in þe park goþ sche
  
The vapour which þat fro þe erþe glood
makeþ þe sonne to seeme rody and brood
But naþeles it was so fair a sight
That it made alle here hertes for to light
What for þe sesoun and þe morwenynge
And for þe foules þat sche herde synge
ffor right anon sche wiste what þey mente
Right by here song and knew alle here entente
 The knotte why þat euery tale is told
If it be taryed til lust be cold
Of hem þat han it herkned after yore  
The sauour passeþ euer lenger þe more
ffor fulsomnesse of prolixite
And by þis same resoun þenkeþ me
I scholde to þe knotte condescende
And maken of hire walkyng sone an ende
 Amydde a tree fordrye as whit as chalk
As Canacee was pleyng in hire walk
Ther sat a ffaukon ouer hir heed ful hye
That with a pitous voys so gan to crye
That al þe woode resede of hire crye
And beten hadde hire self so pitously 
With boþen hire wynges til þe reede blood
Ran endelong þe tree þer as sche stood
And euer in oon sche cryed alwey and schrighte
And with hire beek hir seluen so sche pighte
That þer ne was tygre ne cruel beste
That duelleþ eyþer in woode or in foreste
þat nolde han wept if þat he wepe couþe
ffor sorwe of hire sche schright alwey so louþe
ffor þer nas neuere yit no man on lyue
If þat I couþe a fawkon wel descryue
That herde of such anoþer of fayrnesse
As wel of plumage as of gentilnesse
Of schap of al þat mighte rekened be
A fawkon peregryn þanne semed sche
  
Of fremde londe and euermore as sche stood
Sche swounede now and now for lak of blood
Til wel neigh is sche fallen fro þe tree
This faire kinges doughter þis kanacee
That on hir fynger bar þe queynte ryng
þurgh which sche vnderstood wel euery þing
That any foul may in his ledne sayn
And kowde answere him in his ledne agayn
haþ vnderstande þat þis fawkon sayde
And wel neigh for þe rouþe almost sche deyde
And to þe tree sche goþ ful hastily  
And on þis fawkon lokeþ pitously
And held hire lappe abrood for wel sche wiste 
The fawkon moste falle from þe twyste 
whan þat it swownede next for lakke of blood
A long while to wayte hire sche stood
Til atte laste sche spak in þis maneere
Vnto þe hauk as ȝe schal after heere
what is þe cause if it be for to telle
That ye ben in þis furial peyne of helle
Quod Canacee vnto þis hawk aboue
Is þis for sorwe of deth or los of loue
ffor as I trowe þise beþ causes tuo
That causen moost a gentil herte woo
Of oþer harm it redeþ nought to speke
ffor þi your self vpon your self yow wreke
which þat proueþ wel þat eyþer Ire or drede
Moot ben encheson of youre cruel dede
Syn þat I se non oþer wight yow chace
ffor loue of god so doþ your selue grace
Or what may be your help for west nor est
Ne saugh I neuer er now no bryd ne best
That ferde with himself so pitously
ye slee me with youre sorwe verrayly
I haue of yow so gret compassioun
ffor goddes loue com fro þe tree a doun
  
And as I am a kinges doughter trewe
If þat I verraily þe causes knewe
Of youre disease if it lay in my might
I wolde amende it or þat it were night
Als wisly help me grete god of kynde
And herbes schal I right ynowe fynde
To hele wiþ ȝour hurtes hastily
Tho schrighte þis faukon yet more pitously
Than euer sche dide and fil to grounde anon
And liþ on swowne deed as ony stoon
Til Canacee haþ in hir lappe hire take  
vnto þat tyme sche gan of swowne awake 
And after þat sche of swowne gan abreide
Right in hir hawkes leodne þus sche seyde
That pite renneth sone in gentil herte
ffeelyng his similitude in peynes smerte 
Is proued alday as men may it see
As wel by werk as by auctorite
ffor gentil herte kepeþ gentillesse
I se wel þat ye han of my distresse
Compassion my faire Canace 
Of verray wommanly benignite 
That nature in youre principles haþ set
But for non hope for to fare þe bet
But for to obeye vnto youre herte fre 
And for to maken oþer be war by me 
As by þe whelp chastised is þe leon
Right for þat cause and for þat conclusion
Whil þat I haue a leyser and a space
Myn harm I wol confessen er I pace
And euer whil sche can hir sorwe tolde
That oþer wepte as sche to water wolde
Til þat þe fawkon bad hir to be stille 
And with a sike þus sche seyde hire tille
Ther I was bred allas þat ilke day
And fostred in a roche of marbul gray
  
So tendrely þat noþing eylede me
I ne wiste nought what was aduersite
Til I couþe flee ful hye vnder þe sky
þo dwelte a tercelet me faste by
That semede welle of alle gentilnesse
Al were he ful of treson and falsnesse 
It is wrapped vnder humble cheere
And vnder hiew of trouþe and in swich manere
Vnder plesance and vnder bysy peyne
That no wight couþe han wende he coude feyne
So deepe in greyn he dyed his colours  
Right as a serpent hit him vnder flours
Til he may se his tyme for to byte
Right so þis god of loues ypocrite
Doþ so his cerymonijs obeissances
And kepte in semblant alle his obseruances
That sowneþ in to gentilesse of loue
As in a tombe is al þe faire aboue
And vnder is þe corps swich as ȝe woot
Swich was þis ypocrite boþe cold and hoot
And in þis wise he serued his entente
That saue þe feende non wiste what he mente
Til he so longe hadde wopen and compleyned
And many a yeer his seruise to me feyned
Til þat myn herte to pitous and to nyce
Al Innocent of his crowned malice
fforfered of his deþ as þoughte me
vpon his oþes and his seurte
Grauntede him loue vpon þis condicion
That euer mo myn honour and renoūn
were saued boþe preuy and apert
This is to sein þat after his dissert
I yaf him al myn herte and my þought
God woot and he þat oþer wise nought
And tok his herte in chaunge of myn for ay
But soþ is seyd go sethen many a day
  
A trewe wight and a þeef þenkeþ nat oon
And whan he saugh þe þing so fer ygon
That I grauntede him fully my loue 
In swich a gyse as I haue sayd aboue 
And yeuen him my trewe herte as fre 
As he swore he yaf his herte to me 
Anon þis Tygre ful of doublenesse
ffil on his knees wiþ so deuoute humblesse
wiþ hye reuerence and as by his cheere 
So lik a gentil louere of manere 
So rauysshed as it semede for þe ioye  
That neuere Iason ne paris of Troye
Iason certes ne non oþer man
Syn lameth was þat Aldirfirst bygan
To louen tuo as writen folk biforn
Ne neuer siþþe þe firste man was born
Ne couþe man by twenty þousand part
Countrefete þe sophimes of his art
Ne were worþi to vnbokele his galoche
Ther doublenesse or feynyng scholde aproche
Ne so couþe þanke a wight as he dide me 
his manere was an heuene for to se
Til eny womman were sche neuer so wys
So peynted he and kembeþ at poynt devys
As wel his wordes as his continance
And I so loued him for his obeissance
And for þe trouþe I demed in his herte
That if so were þat any þing him smerte
Al were it neuer so lite and I it wiste
Me þoughte I felte deþ at myn herte twiste
And schortly so ferforth þis þing went
That my wille has his willes Instrument
This is to sein my wille obeyede his wille
In alle þing as fer as reson fille
Kepyng þe boundes of my worschipe euere
Ne neuer hadde I þing so leef ne leuere
  
As him god woot ne neuere schal no mo
This laste lengere þan a yer or tuo
 That I supposed of him no þing but good
But fynally þus atte laste it stood
That fortune wolde þat he moste twynne
Out of þat place which þat I was Inne
Wher me was wo it is no question
I kan not make of it discripcion
ffor o þing dar I telle boldely
I knowe what is þe peyne of deþ þer by
Such harm I felte for he ne mighte beleue  
So on a day of me he tok his leue 
So sorwfully eek I wende verrayly
That he hadde feeled as moche harm as I
Whan þat I herde him speke and sawe his hewe 
But naþeles I þoughte he was so trewe
And eek þat he repaire scholde agayn
Wiþinne a litel while soþ to sayn
And reson wolde eek þat he moste go
ffor his honour as ofte happeþ so
That I made vertu of necessite 
and took it wel syn þat it  moste be
As I best mighte I hidde from him my sorwe
And took him by þe hond seint Iohn to borwe
And seyde þus lo I am youres al
Beþ swich as I haue be to yow and schal
What he answerde it needeþ nat reherse
Who can seyn bet þan he who can do werse
Whan he haþ al wel seyd þan haþ he doon
Therfore byhoueþ him a wel long spoon
That schal eten wiþ a feend þus herde I seye 
So atte laste he moot forþ his weye
And forth he fleþ til he com þer him leste
Whan it com him to purpos for to reste 
I trowe he hadde þilke text in mynde 
That alle þing repeyryng to his kynde 
  
Gladeþ himself  þus seyn men as I gesse 
Men louen of propre kynde newfangilnesse 
As briddes doon þat men in cages feede 
ffor þeigh þou night and day take of hem heede 
And strawe here cages faire as softe as silk
And yeue hem sucre hony bred and mylk
Yet right anon as þat his dore is vppe
he wiþ his feet wil sporne doun his cuppe
And to þe woode he wole and wormes ete
So newefangel ben þei of here mete
And louen noueleries of propre kynde  
No gentilesse of blood may hem bynde
So ferde þis tercelet allas þe day
Though he were gentil born fressche and gay
And goodly for to seen and humble and fre
he saugh vpon a tyme a kyte flee
And sodeinly he loued þe kyte so
That alle his loue is clene fro me go
And haþ his trouþe falsed in þis wyse
Thus haþ þe kite my loue in hire seruise
And I am lorn wiþoute remedye
And wiþ þat word þis faukon gan to crye
And swouned eft in Canacees barm
Gret was þe sorwe for þe haukes harm
That Canacee and alle hire wommen maade
They nyste how þey mighte þe fawkon glade
But Canacee home bereþ hire in hire lappe
And softely in plastres gan hire wrappe
Ther as sche with hir beek haþ hurt hir selue
Now kan not Canace but herbes delue
Out of þe grounde and maken salues newe
Of herbes preciouses and fyn of hewe
To helen wiþ þe hauk fro day to nyght
Sche doþ hir besynesse and alle hire myght
And by hire beddes heed sche made a muwe
And couered it with veluettes bluwe
  
In signe of trouþe þat is in wommen seene
And alle wiþoute þe muwe is peynted greene
In which were peynted alle þese false fowles
As ben þise tydifs tercelettes and owles
Right for þe spyte were peynted hem bysyde
Pyes on hem for to crye and chyde
Thus leet I Canacee hire hawk keeping
I wole nomore as now speke of hire ryng
Til it come eft to purpos for to seyn
how þat þis ffaukon gat hire loue ageyn
Repentant as þe storie telleþ vs  
By mediacion of Camballus
The kinges sone of which I yow tolde 
But hennes forth I wol proces holde
To speke of auentures and of batailles
That yet was neuer herde so gret meruailles
ffirst wil I telle yow of Kambynskan
That in his tyme many a cite wan
And after wol I speke of Algarsif
how þat he wan Theodora to his wyf
ffor whan ful ofte in gret peril he was
Ne hadde he ben holpen by þe hors of bras
And after wol I speken of Camballo
That faught in listes with þe breþeren tuo
ffor Canacee er þat he might hir wynne
And þer I lefte I wol ageyn bygynne
Appolo whirleth vp his char so hye
Til þat þe god mercurius hous þe slye 
Experiment þough non auctorite
Were in þis world is right ynough for me
To speke of wo þat is in mariage
ffor lordynges syn I twelue ȝeer was of age 
Thanked be god þat is eterne alyue
housbondes atte chirche dore I haue had fyue
If I so often might haue wedded be
But alle were worþy men in here degre
But me was told certein nought longe agones

To weddyng in þe Cane of Galile 
That by þilke ensample taught he me
That I ne schulde wedded be but ones
herk eek lo which a scharpe worde for þe nones
Besyde a welle Ihesu god and man
Spak in repreef of þe Samaritan
Thow hast yhadde v housebondes quod he
And þat ilke man þat now haþ þe
Is not þin housbonde þus sayde he certayne
What he mente þerby I can nought sayne
Wele But þat I axe why þe fyfte man
Was non housbonde to þe Samaritan
how many might sche han in mariage

Ȝitt hardde I neuere telle in al myn age
  
Vppon þis nombre diffinicioun
Men may deuyne and glosen vp and doun
But wel I woot expresse wiþouten lye
God bad vs for to wexe and multiplye
That gentil text can I wel vnderstonde
Eke wel I woot he seyde myn housebonde
Schulde lete fader and mooder and take to me
But of noon nombre mension made he 
Of Bigamye or of Octogamye
Why schulde men þenne haue it in vilanye 
loke here þe wise man king Salomon
I trowe he hadde wyues moo þan on
Now wolde god it leeful were to me 
To be refreisshed half so ofte as he  
Which ȝifte of god hadde he for alle his wyues
No man haþ such þat in þis world a lyue is
God wot þis noble king as to my witte
The firste night hadde many a mery fitte
Wiþ iche of hem so wel was him alyue
Blissed be god þat I haue wedded fyue
Welcome þe sixte whan þat euer he schal
ffor siþþe I wille nought kepe chaste in al
Whan myn housebonde is fro þe world ygon
Som crystne man schal wedde me anon
ffor þan þe apostle seiþ þat I am free
To wedde a goddes half wher it likeþ me
he seiþ þat to be wedded is no senne
Betre is it to be wedded þan to brenne
What rekkeþ me þough folk sey vylanye
Of schrewed lameth and his Bygamye 
I woot wel Abraham was an holy man
And Iacob eek as fer as euer I can
And ech of hem hadde wyues mo þan tuo
And many anoþer holy man also
Wher can ȝe say in any maner age
That vs god defended mariage
  
By expresse word I pray yow telleþ me
Or wher comaunded he virginite
I wot as wel as ye it is no drede
þe apostel whan he spekeþ of maydenhede
he seyde þerof precepte hadde he noone
Men may counseille a womman to ben oone
But counseilling is no comaundement
he putte it in oure owne Iuggement
ffor hadde god commaunded maydenhede
þanne hadde he dampned weddyng with þe dede
And certes if þer were no seed ysowe
virginite þanne wherof scholde it growe
Poule dorste nought comanden at þe leste
A þing of which his mayster ȝaf him non heste  
The darte is sette vppe fro virginite
Chase who so may who so renneþ best lat see
But þis word is nought take of euery wight
But þere as god wolde yeue it of his might
I wot wel þat þe apostel was a mayde 
But naþeles þough þat he wrot or sayde
he wolde þat euery wight were such as he 
Al nys nat but counseile to virginite
And for to be a wijf he yaf me leue
Of Indulgence so is it no repreue
To wedde me if þat my make deye 
Wiþoute excepcion of Bygamie 
Al were it good no womman for to touche
he mente as his body or in his couche
ffor peril is boþe to touche and for to assemble
Ȝe knowe what þis ensample may resemble
This al and some he heeld virginite
More perfyt þan wedded in freelte
ffreltee clepe I not but þat he and sche
Wolde leede here lijf al in chastite
I graunte it wel I haue non envye
Though maydenhede preferre Bygamye
  
It likeþ hem to be clene in body and gost
Of myn estate I wole make no boost
ffor wel ȝe knowe a lord in his houshold
haþ not euery vessele of golde 
Some ben of tree  and doon here lord seruise
God clepeþ folk to him in sondry wise
And euerich haþ of god a propre ȝifte 
Some þis some þat as him likeþ schifte
virginite is gret perfection
And conscience eek with deuocion
But crist þat of perfection is welle
Bad nought euery wight he schulde selle
Al þat he hadde and ȝiue it to þe pore
And in swich wise folwe him and his lore  
he spak to hem þat wolde lyue parfitly
And lordynges by ȝoure leue þat am not I
I wole bystowe þe flour of alle myn age
In charite and fruyt of maryage
Telle me also to what conclusion
Were membres maade of generacion
And of so parfyt wise and why ywrought
Tristeþ right wel þey were not made for nought
Glose who so wile and seye boþe vp and doun
That þey were made for purgacioun
Of vryne and oure boþe þinges smale
Were eek to knowe a femal from a male
And for non oþer cause what seye ȝe no
The experience woot it is nouȝt so
So þat þe clerkes be not with me wroþe
I seye þis þat þey maked be for boþe
This is to seyn for office and for eese
Of engendrynge þare we not god displese
Why schulden men elles in here bokes sette
That man schal yelde to his wijf his dette
Now wherwiþ scholde he paye his payement
yf þat he ne vsed his seely instrument
  
Than were þey maade vpon a creature
To purgie vryne and eek for engendure
But I seye nought þat euery wight is holde
That haþ such harneys as I to yow of tolde
To gon and vsen hem in engendrure
Thanne scholde men take of chastite no cure
Crist was a mayden and schapen as a man
And many a seynt syn þat þe world bygan
Yet lyued þey euere in parfyt chastite
I nel envye with no virginite
lete hem ete brede of pured whete seed
And late vs wyues ete barly breed
And yet with barly breed Mark telle can
Oure lord 
in suche estate as god hath cleped vs
I wol perceiver  I am nought precious
in wiffhode wol I vse myn instrument
as frely as my maker  hath hit sent
yiff I be dangerous  god yeve me sorowe
myn housbonde shal it haue both eve and amorwe
whan that him list  com forth and pay his dette
an housbonde wol I haue  I wol not lette
which shal be  both my dettour and my thralle
and han his tribulacioun withalle
vppon his flesshe  while that I am his wiff
I haue the power  durynge al my liff
vppon his propre body  and not he
right thus the Appostel  tolde vnto me
and bad oure housbondes  for to love vs welle
alle this sentence  me liketh euerydelle
Uppe sterte the pardoner  and that anoon

and that thei hadde  yeve me al here londe
what shulde I take kepe hem for to please
but if it were my profyte  and myn ease
I sette hem so a worke  bi my fay
that many a night  thei songen welaway
the Bacoun was not fette for hem I trowe
That some men haue in Essexe at Dunmowe  
I gouerned hem so wel after my lawe
That iche of hem ful blisful was and fawe 
To bringe me gay þinges fro þe feyre
They were ful glad whan I spak to hem faire
ffor god it woot I chidde hem spytously
Now herkneþ how I bar me proprely
ye wyse wyues þat can vnderstande
Thus schulde ye speke and bere hem wrong on hande
ffor half so boldely þer can no man
Swere and lye as a womman can
I seye not þis by wyues þat ben wise 
But it be whan þat þey hem mysavyse 
A wise wijf schal if þat sche can hire good
Bere him on hond þat þe kow is wood
And take witnesse of hir owne mayde 
Of hire assent but herkeþ how I sayde 
Sire olde kaynard is þis þin array
Why is my neyheboures wijf so gay
Sche is honoured ouer al wher sche goþ
I sitte at hom I haue no þrifty cloþ
What dostow at my neyhebores hous
Is sche so fair art þou so amerous
  
What roune ȝe wiþ oure mayde benedicite
Sire olde lechour let þy iapes be 
And if I haue a gossibb or a freende
Wiþoute gilte ȝe chide as a feende
If þat I walke or pleye vnto his hous
þou comest home as drunken as a mous
And prechest on þi benche wiþ euel preef
þou seist to me it is a gret meschief
To wedde a pouer womman for costage
And if þat sche be riche of gret parage
þanne seistow þat it is a tormentrie 
To suffre hire pryde and hire malencolie 
And if þat sche be fair þou verray knaue 
Thow seist þat euery holour wol hir haue   
Sche may no while in chastite abyde
That is assayed vppon eche syde
Thou seist some folk desire vs for richesse
Some for oure schapp and some for oure fayrnesse
And some for sche can oþer synge or daunce
þus saistow wernard god ȝiue þe meschance
Some for here hondes and here armes smale
Thus goþ al to þe deuel by þy tale
þou seist men may not kepe a castel walle
It may so longe assailed ben ouer alle 
And if þat sche be foule þou seist þat sche
Coueiteþ euery man þat sche may see
ffor as a spaynel sche wol on him lepe
Til þat sche fynde som man þat wol hir chepe
Ne non so grey goos goþ þer in þe lake
As seist þou þat wol be wiþouten make
And seist it is an hard þing for to weelde
A wight þat noman wille his þankes helde
Thus seistow lorel whan þou gost to bedde
And þat no wys man needeþ for to wedde
And noman þat entendiþ to þe heuene
Wiþ wilde þunder dent and fyre leuene 
  
Mote þy wicked necke be tobroke
þou seist þat droppyng houses and eek smoke
And chydyng wyues maken men to fle
Out of here owne houses a benedicite
What eyleþ swich an olde man for to chyde
Thou seist we wyues wille oure vices hyde
Til we be faste and þanne we wille hem schewe
Wel may þis be a prouerbe of a schrewe
Thou seist þat Oxen assen hors and houndes
They ben assayed at diuerse stoundes
Bacynes lauours or þat men hem bye
Spoones stooles and swich housbondrye
And so ben cloþes pottes and oþer arrayes
But of wommen aren maked non assayes  
Til þei ben wedded olde dotard schrewe
And seist how þanne we wil oure vices schewe
Thou seist also þat it displeses me
But if þou wille preyse my beaute
And but þou poure alwey vpon my face
And clepe me faire dame in euery place
And but þou make a feste on þat ilke day
That I was born and make me freische and gay
And but þou do to my norys honour
And to my chambre wiþinne my bour
And to my fadres folk and his allyes
Thus seist þou olde barel ful of lyes
And yit of oure apprentys Iankyn
ffor his crispe heer schynynge so gold fyn
And for he squyeres me boþe vp and doun
yet hastow þought and fals suspecion
I wil him nought þough þou were deed to morwe
But telle me þis why hydest þou with sorwe
Thy keyes of þi cheste away fro me 
It is my good as wel as þin parde
What wenestow make an ydyot of oure dame 
Now by þat lord þat called is seint Iame
  
þou schalt not boþe þough þou were wood
Be maister of my body and my good
That oon þou schalt forgo maugre þin eyȝen
What helpeþ it on me enquere and spyen
I trowe þough þou woldest loke me in þi cheste
þou scholdest seie wyf go where þe leste
Take youre disporte I wol not leue no tales
I knowe ȝow for a good wyf dame Alis
We loue no man þat takeþ keepe or charge
Where þat we go we wole be at oure large
Of alle men blessed mote he be
The wise astrologien dann ptholome
That seiþ þis prouerbe in his almageste
Of alle men his wisdam is hyeste  
That rekkeþ not who haþ þe world in hande
By þis prouerbe þou schalt wel vnderstande
haue þou ynough what þar þe rekke or kare
how meryly þat oþer folkes fare
ffor certes olde dotard by youre leue
ye schulle haue queynte right ynough at eue
he is to gret a nygard þat wol warne
A man to light a candel at his lantarne
he schal haue neuer þe lesse light parde
haue þou ynough þe þar not pleyne þe
þou seist also þat if þou make vs gay
Wiþ cloþing or with precious array
That it is peril of oure chastite
And ȝit with wordes þou most enforce me 
And seie þise wordes in þe apostels name
In habyt made with chastite and schame
ye wommen schulle apparaille you quod he
And nat in tressed heer and gay perre
As perle ne wiþ golde ne cloþes riche
After þi texte ne after þi rubriche
I wol not werke as mochil as a gnatt
þou saydest als þat I was like a catt
  
But who so wolde senge a cattes skyn
þanne wolde þe catt wel dwellen in his In
And if þe cattes skyn be slike and gay
Sche nel not dwelle in house half a day
But forþ sche wille or ony day be dawed
To schewe hire skyn and go a caterwrawed
þis is to say if I be gay sir schrewe
I wil renne out my borel for to schewe
Sire olde fool what helpeþ þe to spien
They þou prey argus with his þousand yhen
To be my warde corps as he can best
In feiþ he schal not kepe me but if me lest
yet couþe I make his berd so mote I þee
þou seist eek þat þer ben þinges þree  
þe whiche þinges troublen al þis Erþe
And þat no wight may endure þe ferþe
O leue sire schrewe ihesu schorte þi lijf
yet prechest þou and seist an hateful wijf
yrekned is for oon of þis meschances
Ben þer non oþer maner resemblances
þat ye may likene ȝoure parables to
But if a sely wijf be on of þo
And likenest wommannes loue to helle
To bareyne lond þer water may not dwelle
þou likenest it also to wilde fyre
The more it brenneth þe more it haþ desire
To consume eny þing þat brende wolde be
Thou seist þat right as wormes schende a tree
Right so a wyf destroyeþ hir housebonde
This knowen þey þat ben to wyues bonde
lordynges right þus ȝe han vnderstande
Bar I stifly myn olde housbondes on hande
þat þus þey seyden in here drunkenesse
And eek þat he hadde suspecion and Ielousnesse
On Iankyn and on my nefe also
O lord þe peyne I dede hem and þe woo
  
fful gilteles by goddes sweete pyne
ffor as an hors I couþe boþe byte and whyne
I couþe pleyne and I was in þe gilte
Or elles ofte tyme I hadde ben spilte
Who so þat first to mylle comþ ferst grynte
I pleyned first so was oure werre stynte
þey were ful glade to excusen hem ful blyue 
Of þing which þei agilte neuer here lyue
Of wenches wolde I beren hem on honde
Whan þat for sike þey might vnneþe stonde
yet tykeled I his herte for þat he
Wende I hadde of him so gret chiertee
I swore þat al my walkynge be night
Was for to aspye wenches þat he dighte  
vnder þat colour hadde I many a myrþe
ffor alle such witte is ȝiue vs in oure birþe
Desceipte wepyng spynnyng god haþ ȝiue
To womman kyndely whil þat þei may lyue
And þus of o þing I auaunte me
At þe ende I hadde þe beste in eche degre
By sleighte or force or by som maner þing
As by continuel murmur and grucching
Namely a bedde hadde þey meschaunce
Ther wolde I chide and do hem no plesaunce
I wolde no lenger in þe bedde abyde
If þat I felte his arm ouer my syde
Til he hadde made his raunsom vnto me
Thanne wolde I suffre him do his nycete
And þerfore euery man þis tale I telle
Wynne who so may al are for to selle
Wiþ empty hande men may non haukes lure
ffor wynnyng wolde I al his lust endure
And make me a feyned appetyt
And ȝit in bakon hadde I neuer delit
That maked me þat euer I wolde him chyde
ffor þough þe pope hadde sete him besyde
  
I wolde nouȝt spare him at his oughne bord
ffor by my trouþe I quitte him word for word
As helpe me verrey god omnipotent
þough I right now schulde make my testament
I ne owe him a word þat it nys quitte
I brought it so aboute by my witte
That he muste ȝiue it vp as for þe beste 
Or elles hadde we neuere ben in reste
ffor þough he loked as a leoun
ȝet scholde he faile of his conclusion
Thenne wolde I seye now goode leef take keepe 
how mekely lokeþ wilkyn oure scheepe
Com ner my spouse lat me ba þi cheeke
ȝe schulle be al pacient and meeke  
And han a sweete spiced conscience 
Syn ȝe so preche of Iobis pacience
Suffreþ alwey syn ȝe so wel can preche
And but ȝe do certein we schul ȝou teche
That it is fair to haue a wyf in pees
On of vs moot bowen doutelees
And siþþe a man is more resonable
Than woman is sire ȝe moste be suffrable 
What eyleþ ȝou to grucche þus and grone
Is it for ȝe wolde haue my queynte allone
Whi tak it al  lo haue it euery del
Petir I schrewe ȝou but ȝe loue me wel
ffor If I wolde selle my bele chose
I couþe walke as freissche as a rose
But I wil kepe it for ȝour owne toþ
ȝe be to blame by god I seye ȝou soþ
Suche maner wordes hadde we on honde
Now wol I speke of my ferþe housbonde 
 My ferþe housbond was a reuelour
This is to seye he hadde a paramour
And I was yong and ful of Ragerie
Styborne and strong and ioly as a pye
  
lord how couþe I daunce to an harpe smale 
And synge ywys as eny nyghtyngale 
Whan I hadde dronke a draughte of sweete wyn
Meteling þe foule cherle þe swyn
That with a staf byraft his wif hir lyf
ffor sche drank wyn þough I hadde ben his wijf
Ne schulde he nought han daunted me fro drynke
And after wyn on venus most I þinke
ffor also syker as colde engendreþ hayl
A likerous mouþ moste han a likerous tail
In womman violent is no defence
This knowen lecchoures by experience
But lord crist whan þat it remembreþ me 
vpon my ȝouþe and my Iolyte  
It tykeleþ me about myn herte roote
vnto þis day it doþ myn herte boote
þat I haue had my world as in my tyme
But age allas þat al wol envenyme
haþ me byraft my beaute and my piþ
lat go far wel þe deuel go þerwiþ
The flour is gon þer is nomore to telle
The bren as I best can now moot I selle
But ȝet to be right mery wol I fonde 
Now forþ to telle of my ferþe housbonde
I seye I hatte in herte gret despyt
That he of eny oþer hadde delyt
But he was quyte by god and by sent Iose
I made him of þe same woode a crose
Not of my body in no foul manere
But certeinly I made folk such cheere
That in his owne grece I made him frye
ffor angery and for verray Ialousie 
By god in erþe I was his purgatorie
ffor which I hope his soule be in glorie 
ffor god it wot he sat ful ofte and song
Whan þat his scho ful bitterly him wrong
  
ffor þer was non sauf god and he þat wiste
In many wise where I him twiste
he deyed whan I cam fro Ierusalem
And liþ ygraue vnder þe Roode beem
Al nys his tombe not so curious
As was þe sepulcre of him Darius
Which þat appelles wroughten subtilly
It nys but waste to burye him preciously
lat him far wel god ȝiue his soule reste
he is now in his graue and in his cheste
 Now of my fyfþe housbonde wil I telle
God late neuer his soule come in helle 
And ȝit was he to me þe moste schrewe 
That feele I on my ribbes al by rewe  
And euere schal vnto myn endyng day
But in a bed he was so freissh and gay
And þerwiþal so wel couþe he me glose 
Whan þat he wolde han my bele chose 
þat þough he hadde me bete on euery boon
he couþe wynne agayn my loue anon
I trowe I loued him þe bet for he
Was of his loue daungerous to me
We wymmen han if þat I schal not lye
In þis manere a queinte fantasye
Wayte what þing we may nought lightly haue
Therafter wole we crye alday and craue 
fforbede vs þing and þat desyren we
Prees on vs faste and þanne wil we flee 
Wiþ daunger outen we alle oure chaffare
Gret prees at market makeþ deere ware 
And to gret cheep is holde  at litel pris
This knoweþ euery womman þat is wys
My ve housbonde god his soule blesse
Which þat I took for loue and no richesse 
he som tyme was a clerk of Oxenforde
And hadde left scole and wente at hom to borde
  
Wiþ my gossybb dwellyng in oure toun
God haue hire soule hir name was alisoun
Sche knew myn herte and al my priuyte 
Bettre þan oure parissche prest so mote I þee 
To hire bywreyed I my counseil al
ffor hadde myn housbonde pyssed on a wal
Or don a þing þat schulde haue cost his lyf
To hire and to anoþer worþy wyf
And to my neece which I loue wel
I wolde han told his counseill euerydell
And so I dede ful ofte god it woot
That made his face often reed and hoot
ffor verray schame and blamed himself for he
hadde told to me so gret a pryuyte  
And so it felle þat ones in a lente
So ofte tyme vnto my gossib wente 
ffor euer ȝit I loued to be gay
And for to walke in march aueril and may
ffrom hous to hous to herkne sondry tales
That Iankyn clerk and my gossibb dame alis
And I my self in to þe feldes wente
myn housbond was at london al þat lente
I hadde þe bettre leysir for to pleye
And for to see and eek for to be seye
Of lusty folk what wist I wher my grace
Was schapen for to be or in what place
þerfore made I my visitacions
To vigilies and to processions
To prechyng eek and to þis pilgrimages
To pleyes of myracles and of mariages
And wered vpon my gaye skarlet gytes
This wormes ne þise moþþes ne þise mytes
vppon my peril frete hem neuer a del
And wostow why for þey were vsed wel
 Now wol I tellen forþ what happed me
I seye þat in þe feeldes walked we
  
Til trewely we hadde such dalyance
þis clerk and I þat of my purueiaunce
I spak to him and seyde how þat he
If I were wydow schulde wedde me
ffor certeynly I seye for no bobaunce 
þat was I neuer ȝit wiþoute purueance
Of mariage ne of oþer þinges eeke
I holde a mouses witte nat worþ a leek
þat haþ but oon hole for to stirten to
And if þat faile þan is al ydo

my dame taughte me  that subtilte
and eke I seide  I mette of him al night
he wolde haue shamed me  as I lay vpright
and al my bed was ful  of verry blood
but yit I hope  that ye shul do me good
for blood bitokeneth gold  as me was taughte
and al was fals  for I dremed right naughte
but as I folwed ay  my dames lore
als wel of that  as of other thinges more
But now sire lat me see what I schal seyn
A ha by god I haue my tale agayn
Whan þat my ferþe housbonde was on bere
I wepe algate and made sory chere  
As wyues mooten for it is vsage 
And with my keuercheeff couered my visage
But for þat I was purueyed of a make 
I weep but smale and þat I vndertake
To chirche was myn housbond yborn on morwe
With neghebours þat for him made sorwe
And Iankyn oure clerk was on of þo
As help me god whan þat I seih him go
After þe beere me þought he hadde a paire
Of legges and of feet so cleene and faire
That al myn herte I yaf vnto his holde
he was I trowe twenty wynter olde
  
And I was fourty if I schal seye soþ
But yet I hadde alwey a coltes toþ
Gat toþed I was and þat bycam me wel
I hadde þe printe of seint venus sel
As help me god I was a lusty oon
And fair and riche and ȝong and wel bygon
And trewely as myn housbond tolde me
I hadde þe beste queynte þat mighte be

in feling  and myn herte is Marcian
Venus me yaff my lust  my likerousnes
and Mars yaff me  my sturdy hardynes
Myn ascendent was Taur and Mars þerinne
Allas allas þat euer loue was synne 
I folwed ay myn inclinacion
By vertue of my constellacion ·
That made me I couþe not wiþdrawe
My chambre of venus from a good felawe

and also in another prevy place
for god so wis be  my sauacioun
I loued neuere  bi no discressioun
but euere folwed  myn appetite
al were he long  shorte  blak or white
I toke no kepe  so that he liked me
how pore he was  ne eke of what degre
What schulde I seye but at þe monþes ende
This Ioly clerk Iankyn þat was so heende 
haþ wedded me with gret solempnite
And to him ȝaf I al þe lond and fee 
That euere was me ȝiuen þer byfore
But afterward repentede me ful sore
he nolde suffre no þing of my lest
By god he smot me onys on þe lest
ffor þat I rente out of his book a leef
That of þat strook my eeren woxen deef    
 Stiborne I was as is a leonesse 
And of my tonge a verray Iangleresse 
And walke I wolde as I hadde don biforn
ffrom hous to hous al þough he hadde it sworn
ffor wiþ ful often tyme he wolde preche
And me olde romance gestes teche
how he simplicius Gallus lefte his wijf
And hire forsook for terme of his lijf
Not but for openhede he hir say
Lokyng out at his dore on a day
Anoþer Romayn tolde he me by name
That for his wyf was at a Somer game 
Wiþoute his wytyng he forsook hire eeke
And þanne wolde he vpon his bible seeke
That ilke prouerbe of ecclesiaste
Wher he comaūndeþ and forbedeþ faste
Man schal not suffre his wyf to roule aboute
þan wolde he seye right þus wiþouten doute
Who so þat buldeth his hous al of salwes
And prikeþ his blynde hors ouer þe falwes
And suffreþ his wijf go for to seeken halwes
Is worþy for to be hanged on þe galwes
But al for nought I sette nat an hawe
Of his prouerbes ne of his olde lawe
Ne I wolde not of him corrected be 
I hate him þat my vice telleþ me
And so don mo god woot of vs þan I
This made him with me wood al outerly
I nolde not forbere him in no caas
Now wil I seie ȝou soþ by seint Thomas
Why þat I rent out of his book a leef
ffor which he smot me þat I was deef
he hadde a book þat gladly night and day
ffor his disporte he wolde rede alway
he clepede valery and Theofraste
At which book he lowh alwey ful faste    
And eek þer was som tyme a clerk in Rome 
A Cardinal þat highte seint Ierome
That made a book aȝein Iouynian
In which book eeke þer was Terculan
Crisippus Trocula and helowys
That was abbesse nat fer fro Parys
And eek þe parables of Salomon
Ovides art and bokes many oon
And alle þise were bounde in oo volume
And euery night and day was his custume
Whan he hadde leysyr and vacacioun
ffrom oþer worldly occupacion
To reden in þis book of wikked wyues
he knew of hem mo legendes and lyues
Than ben of goode wyues in þe bible 
ffor trusteþ wel it is an impossible
That ony clerk wole speken good of wyues
But if it be of holy seintes lyues
Ne of non oþer wommen neuer þe mo
Who peynted þe lyoun tel me who
By god if wommen hadden writen stories
As clerkes han wiþinne here oratories
They wolde haue writen of men more wickednesse
Than alle þe marke of adam may redresse
The children of mercurie and venus
Ben in here werkynge contrarious
Mercurie loueþ wisdam and science 
And venus loueþ ryot and dispence 
And for here diuerse disposicion
Eche falleþ in oþres exaltacion
As þus god wot mercurie is desolat
In Piscis where venus is exaltat
And venus falleþ þer mercurie is reised
Therfore no womman of no man is preysed
The clerk whan he is olde and may not do
To Venus werk nought worþ his olde scho    
Than sitte he doun and writ in his dotage 
That wommen con not keepe here mariage
But now to purpos why I tolde þe
That I was beten for a book pardee
Vppon a night Iankyn þat was oure syre
Redde on his book as he sat by þe fyre
Of Eua first þat for hire wickednesse
Was al mankynde brought to wrecchednesse

that bought vs with his herte blood ageyne
lo here expresse of recorde  may ye fynde
that woman was the loos  of al mankynde  
Tho redde he me how Sampson lost his heris
Slepyng his lemman kit it wiþ hir scheris
Thurgh which treson lost he boþe his eyen
Tho redde he me if þat I schal not lyen
Of ercules and of his deyanire 
That caused him to sette himself a fyre
No þing forgat he þe penance and woo
That Socrates hadde with his wyues tuo
how þat ancipa caste pisse on his heed
This seely man sat stille as he were deed
he wyped his heed no more durste he seyn
But or þat þundir stynte comeþ a reyn
Of Phasipha þat was þe queen of Grete 
ffor schrewednesse him þought þe tale swete
ffy spek nomore it is a grisly þing
Of hire horrible lust and hire likyng
Of Clitermistra for hire leccherie
That falsly made hir housbonde for to dye
he redde it wiþ wel good deuocion
he tolde me for what occasion
Amphiorax at Thebes lost his lyf
Myn housbond had a legend of his wijf
Eriphilem þat for an ouche of golde
haþ pryuyly vnto þe Grekes tolde
  
Wher þat hir housbond hid him in a place
ffor which he hadde at Thebes sory grace
Of lyma tolde he me and of lucye
They boþe made here housbondes for to dye  
That on for loue þat oþer was for hate
lyma hire housebonde on euen late
Enpoysoned hadde for sche was his foo
Lucia likerous loued hir housbonde so
That for he scholde vppon hir alwey þinke
Sche yaf him such a loue maner drynke
That he was deed er it was by þe morwe
And þus algates housbondes han sorwe
Than tolde he me how oon latumyus
Compleigned to his felaw arius
That in his gardyn growed such a tree
On which he seyde þat his wyues þre
hanged hemselue for hertes dispitous
O leeue broþer quod þis arious
ȝif me a plante of þat blisful tree
And in my gardyn planted schal it be
Of later date of wyues haþ he redde
That han slayne here housbondes in þe bedde
And leet hir lecchour dight hir al þe night
Whan þat þe corps lay in þe floor vpright
And some han dryuen nayles in here brayn
Whil þat þey sleepe and þus þey han hem slayn
Some han ȝiuen poyson in here drynke
He spak more harme þan herte may beþynke
And þerwiþal he knew of mo prouerbes
þan in þis worlde þer growen gresse or herbes
Bet is quod he þin habitacion
Be with a leoun or a foul dragon
Than with a womman vsyng for to chyde
Bet is quod he heihe in þe roof abyde
Than wiþ an angry wyf doun in an hous
They ben so wicked and contrarious
  
þey hateþ þat here housbondes loueþ ay
he seyde a womman cast hir schame away
Whan sche cast of hir smok and forþermo
A fair womman but sche be chast also  
Is lyk a goldryng on a sowes nose
Who wolde wene or wolde suppose
þe woo þat in myn herte was and pyne
And whan I saugh he wolde neuer fyne
To reden on þis cursed book al night
Al sodeinly þre leues haue I plight
Out of his book right as he red and eeke
I with my fest so took him on þe cheeke
þat in oure fire he fille bakward adoun
And he vpstirte as doþ a wood leoun
And with his fest he smot me on þe heed
þat in þe floor I lay as I were deed
And whan he saugh how stille þat I lay
he was agast and wolde han fledde away
Til atte laste out of my swowe I brayde
O hast þou slayn me false þeef I sayde
And for my lond þus hastow moerdred me 
Or I be deed ȝit wol I kisse þe
And neer he come and kneled faire adoun
And seyde deere suster alisoun
As help me god I schal þe neuer smyte
þat I haue doon it is þiself to wyte
fforȝiue it me and þat I þe beseke 
And ȝit eftsones I hitte him on þe cheeke 
And seyde þeef þus mochel am I wreke
Now wil I dye I may no lenger speke
But at þe laste  wiþ mochel care and woo
We felle acorded by vs seluen tuo
he ȝaf me al þe brydel in myn hond
To haue þe gouernance of hous and lond
And of his tunge and of his hand also
And made him brenne his book anon right þo
  
And whan þat I hadde geten vnto me
By maistrie al þe souerainte
þan he seyde myn owne trewe wyf
Do as þou list þe terme of alle þy lif 
kepe þin honour and keep eek myn estate 
After þat day we hadde neuer debate 
God help me so I was to him as kynde
As eny wijf from Denmark in to ynde
And al so trewe and so was he to me 
I pray to god þat sitte in mageste
So blisse his soule for his mercy deere
Now wol I telle my tale if ȝe wol heere
The frere lowh whan he haþ herd al þis
Now dame quod he so haue I ioye or blis
This is a long preamble of a tale
And whan þis somnour herde þe freere gale 
Lo quod þe somnour goddes armes tuo
A freere wille entremette him euermo
lo goode men a flye and eek a freere
Wille falle in euery dissche and eek matiere 
What spekest þou of preambulacion
What amble or trotte or pees or go sit doun
Thou lettest oure disport in þis manere 
ȝe woltow so þou sompnour quod þe ffrere 
Now by my fay I schal er þat I go
Telle of a Somnour such a tale or tuo
That alle þe folk schulle laughen in þis place
Now elles frere I beschrewe þy face
Quod þis somnour and I byschrewe me 
But if I telle þe tales tuo or þre
Of freres or I come to Sydyngborne
þat I schal make þin herte for to morne
  
ffor wel I wot þy pacience is gon
Oure hoste cryde pees and þat anon
And seyde lat þe womman telle hir tale 
Ye faren as folk þat dronken ben of ale
Do dame telle forþ youre tale and þat is beste
Al redy sire quod sche right as yow leste
f þis worþi frere
 forþ þi tale I wol here

IN olde dayes of þe king arthour
f which þat britons speken gret honour
l was þis land fulfild of fayerie
he elfe queen with hire ioly compaignie
aunced wiþouten in many a greene meede
his was þe olde opynion as I rede
 hundred ȝeer ago
 now can noman see non elues moo
 þe grete charite and þe preyeres
 lymytoures and oþre pouere freeres
hat serchen euery land and euery streem
s þikke as motes in þe sonne beem
Blissynge halles chambres boures
itees burghes castels hihe toures
hropes bernes schipenes dayeries
This makeþ þat þer ben no fayeries
ffor þer as wont to walke was an elf
Ther walkeþ now þe lymytour himself
In vndermeles and in morwenynges
And seiþ his matyns and his holy þinges
As he goþ in his lymytacioun
Wommen may go now saufly vp and doun
In euery busch or vnder euery tree
þer is non oþer Incubus but he
And he wol do hem but dishonour
And so felle it  þat þis king arthour
hadde in his hous a lusty bacheler
þat on a day cam rydyng fro ryuer
  
And happed alone as sche was born
he saugh a mayden walkyng him biforn
Of which mayde maugre hire heed
By verray force he refte hir maydenhed
ffor which oppression was such clamour
And swich pursute vnto þe king artour  
That dampned was þis knight for to be deed
By cours of lawe and scholde haue lost his heed
Perauenture such was þe statute þo
But þat þe queene and oþer ladyes mo
So longe preyede þe king of grace 
Til he his lijf him graunted in þe place
And yaf him to þe queen al at hire wille
To cheese wheþer sche wolde him saue or spille
The queen þankeþ þe king with alle hire might
And after þis þus spak sche to þe knight
Whan þat sche seigh hir tyme on a day
þou stondest ȝet quod sche in such aray
þat of þi lijf ȝet hast þou no suerte
I graunte þe lijf if þou canst telle me
What þing is it þat wommen most desiren
Be war and keep þi neeke bon from yren
And if þou canst nought telle it me anon
ȝit wol I ȝiue þe leue for to gon
A twelf monþe and a day to seeke and lere
An answere sufficant in þis matiere
And seurte wil I han or þat þou pace
Thy body for to yelden in þis place
Wo was þis knight and sorufully he sikeþ
But what he may not do al as him likeþ
And at þe laste he chese him for to wende 
And come aȝein right at þe yeres ende 
With swich answere as god wolde him purueye 
And takeþ his leue and wendeþ forþ his weye
he seekeþ euery hous and euery place 
Wher as he hopeþ for to fynde grace
  
To lerne what þing wommen louen most
But he now couþe arryuen in no coost
Wher as he mighte fynde in þis matere 
Tuo creatures acordyng in feere
Some seyden wommen loue best richesse
Some seyde honour some seyden Iolynesse   
Some riche array some seyden lust a bedde 
And ofte time to be wydewe and wedde 
Some seyden þat we be most yesed
Whan þat we ben yflatered and yplesed
he goþ ful neigh þe soþe I wol nat lye
A man schal wynne vs best wiþ flaterie
And with attendaunce and wiþ besynesse
Ben we ylymed boþe more and lesse 
And some men sein how þat we louen best
ffor to be fre and do right as vs lest
And þat noman  repreue vs of oure vice
But seye þat we be wyse and noþing nyce
ffor trewely þer nys non of vs alle 
If eny wight wol clawe vs on þe galle 
þat we nyl loke or he seiþ vs soþ
Assay and he schal fynde it þat he doþ
ffor be we neuer so vicious wiþinne
We wil be holden wys and clene of synne
And some men sein þat gret delyt haue we
ffor to be holden stable and ek secre
And in oo purpos stedefastly to dwelle
And not bewreye þing þat men vs telle
But þat tale is not worþ a rake stele
Parde we wommen konnen noþing hele
Witnesse on Myda wil ȝe heere þe tale 
Ovide amonges oþer þinges smale
Setthe myda hadde vnder his longe heris
Growynge vp his heed two assis eeres
þe whiche vice he hidde as he best might
fful sotilly from euery mannes sight
  
þat saf his wijf þer wist of it no mo
he loued hire most and trusted to hire also
he preyde hire most þat vnto no creature
Sche scholde not tellen of his disfigure
Sche swor him nay for al þis world to wynne 
Sche wolde do þat vylanye or þat synne  
To make hire housbonde han so foul a name
ffor reproeuyng of him and foule schame
But naþeles hir þoughte þat sche dyde
That sche so longe scholde a counseil hyde
hir þought it sat so sore aboute hir herte
That needely som word hir most asterte
And siþþe sche dorste tellen it no man
Doun to a mareys faste sche ran
Til sche cam þer hir herte was a fyre
And as a bytore bumliþ in þe myre
Sche leyde hire mouþ vnto þe water doun
Bewreye me nought þou water with þy soun
Quod sche to þe I telle it and nomo
Myn housebonde haþ longe asses eeres tuo
Now is myn herte al hool now it is oute
I might no lenger kepe it out of doute
here may ȝe see þough we a tyme abyde
Yet out it moot we mowe no counseil hyde
The remenant of þe tale if ye wol heere
Redeþ Ovyde and ȝe may it leere
This knight of which my tale is specially
Whan þat he saugh he mighte nought come þerby
þis is to seye what wommen louen most
Wiþinne his herte sorwful was þe gost
But home he goþ he mighte nought soiourne
þe day was come þat homward most he tourne
And in his way it happed him to ryde
In alle his care vnder a forest syde
Wher he saugh on one daunce go
Of ladyes xxiiij and ȝit mo
  
Toward þe daunce he drowe him yerne
In hope þat som wisdam schulde he lerne
But certeinly or he cam fully þere 
Vanyssched was þe daunce he nyste not where 
No creature saugh he þat bar lyf
Saue in þe grene he saugh sittyng a wijf  
A foulere wight þer may non deuyse
Agayn þe knight þe olde wijf gan arise
And seyde sire knight here forþ ne liþ no wey
Telle me what þat ȝe seken by ȝoure fey
Perauenture it may þe bettre be 
This olde folk konne mochel þing quod sche 
my leeue mooder quod þis knight certeyn
I am but ded but if þat I can seyn
What þing it is þat wommen most desire
Cowde ȝe me wisse I wolde wel quyte youre hyre
Plight me þi trouþe here in myn hand quod sche
The nexte þing þat I require þe
Thou schalt it do if it lye in þy might
And I wil telle it ȝou or it be night
haue here my trouþe quod þe knight I graunte
Than quod sche I may me wel auaunte
Thy lyf is sauf for I wol stonde þer by
vpon my lijf þe queen wole seye as I
lat se which is þe proudest of hem alle
That wereþ on a kerchef or a calle
þat dar say nay of þat I schal ȝou teche
lat vs go forþ wiþoute lenger speche
Tho rowned sche a pystel in his eere
And bad him to be glad and haue no feere
Whan þey be comen to þe court þis knight
Seyde he hadde holde his day as he hadde hight
And redy was his answere as he sayde
fful many a noble wijf and many a mayde
And many a wydowe for þat þey ben wyse 
The queen hir seluen sittyng as Iustyse
  
Assembled ben his answer for to heere
And afterward þis knight was bode appeere
And þat þe knight schal telle in audience
To euery wight comanded was scilence
What þing þat worldly wommen louen meest
This knight ne stood nat stille as doþ a beest  
But to his question anon answerde 
With manly vois þat al þe court it herde
My liege lady generally quod he 
Womman desireþ to haue soueraynte
As wel ouer hir housbonde and hire loue
And for to be in maystrie him aboue
þis is ȝoure most desyr þough ȝe me kille
Doþ as you list I am heer at your wille
In al þe court ne was þer wijf ne mayde
Ne wydewe þat contraried þat he sayde
But seyden he was worþy han his lijf
And wiþ þat word vp sterte þat olde wijf
Which þat þe knight saugh sittyng on þe grene
Mercy quod sche my souerayn lady queene
Or þat youre court departe do me right
I taughte þis answere vnto þis knight
ffor which he plighte me his treuþe þere
The firste þing I wolde of him requere
he wolde it do if it lay in his might
Byfore þe court þan preye I þe sire knight
Quod sche þat þou me take vnto þi wijf
ffor wel þou wost þat I haue kept þy lijf
If I seye fals sey nay vpon þy fey
This knight answerde allas and weylowey
I wot right wel þat such was my biheste 
ffor goddes loue chese a newe requeste
Tak al my good and lat my body go
Nay þan quod sche I schrewe vs boþe tuo
ffor þough þat I be foule and olde and poure
I nolde for al þe metal ne for oure
  
þat vnder erþe is graue or liþ aboue
But if þat I þy wyf were and þi loue
My loue quod he nay my dampnacion
Allas þat eny of my nacion
Scholde euere so foule ydisparaged be
But al for nought þe ende is þis þat he  
Constreyned was he nedes moste hire wedde
And takeþ þis olde wijf and goþ to bedde
Now wolden some men seyn perauenture
That for my necgligence I do no cure
To telle ȝou þe Ioye and þe array
That at þe feste was þat ilke day
To which þing schortly answere I schal
I seye þer was no ioye ne feste at al
þer nas but heuynesse and mochil sorwe
ffor priuely he wedded hire on a morwe
And al day after hidde him as an owle 
So wo was him his wijf loked so foule
Gret was þe sorwe þe knight hadde in his þought
Whan he was with his wyf a bedde brought
he walweþ and torneþ to and fro
his olde wijf lay smylyng eueremo
And seide O dere housbonde o benedicite
ffareþ euery knight þus with his wijf as ȝe
Is þis þe lawe of king arthures hous
Is euery knight of his loue þus daungerous
I am ȝour owne loue and eek ȝoure wijf
I am sche which þat saued haþ ȝoure lijf
And certes ȝit dede I ȝou neuer vnright
Why fare ȝe þus wiþ me þe ferste night
ȝe faren like a man þat hadde lost his wit
ffy what is my gilt for godes loue tel it
And it schal ben amended if I may
Amended quod þis knight nay nay
That wil nat ben amended neueremo
þou art so loþly and so olde also
  
And þerto comen of so lowh a kynde
That litel wonder is þough I walwe and wynde
So wolde god myn herte wolde breste
Is þis quod sche þe cause of ȝoure vnreste
ȝe· certeinly quod he no wonder is
Now sire quod sche I couþe amende al þis  
If þat me liste or it were dayes þre
So wel ȝe mighte bere ȝou vnto me
 But for ȝe speken of such gentilesse
As is descended out of alle richesse 
þat þerfore schulden ȝe be gentil men
Such erregance nys nat worþ an hen
lo who þat most is vertuous alway
Preuy and aperte and most endeþ ay
To do þe gentil dedes þat he can
And take him for þe grettest gentil man
Crist wole we clayme of him oure gentilnesse
Nat of oure eldres for here olde richesse
ffor þough þey ȝeue vs alle here heritage
ffor which we clayme to be of heigh parage
ȝet may þey not bequeþe for no þing
To non of vs here vertuous lyuyng
That made hem gentil men ycalled be
And bad vs folwen hem in such degre
Wel can þe wise poete of fflorence
That highte dante speke in þis sentence
Lo in swich maner ryme is dauntes tale
fful seelde vp riseþ by his branches smale
Prowesse of man for god of his prowesse 
Wil þat of him we clayme oure gentilnesse
ffor of oure eldres may we noþing clayme
But temperel þing þat we may hurte and mayme
Ek euery wight wot þis as wel as I
If gentilesse were plaunted naturelly
Vnto a certein linage doun þe lyne
Pryue and aperte þanne wolde þey neuer fyne
  
To don of gentilesse þe faire office
þey mighten do no vylanye ne vice
Tak fyre and bere it in þe derkest hous
Bitwixe þis and þe mount of Caucasous
And lat men schette þe dores and go þenne
ȝet wol þe fyr as faire lye and brenne  
As þough a þousand men might it beholde
his office naturel ay wol it holde 
vp peril of lyf til þat it dye 
here may ȝe se wel how þat genterie 
Is not annexed to possession
Siþþe folk do nat here operacion
alwey as doþ þe fir lo in his kinde
ffor god it wot men may ful often fynde
A lordes sone do schame and vilanye
And he þat wol haue pris of his gentrie
ffor he was boren of a gentil hous
And hadde his eldres noble and vertuous
And nyl himseluen do no gentil dedes
Ne folwe his gentil ancestre þat ded is
he nys nat gentil be he duk or eerle
ffor vyleyns synful dedes make a cheerle
ffor gentilnesse nys but reneute
Of þin ancestres for here beaute
Which is a strong þing for þi persone
The gentilesse comeþ fro god allone
Thanne comeþ oure verray gentilesse of grace
It was noþing byqueþe vs wiþ oure place 
þinkeþ how noble as seiþ valerius
Was þilke Tullius hostilius
That out of pouert ros to heigh noblesse
Redeþ Senec and redeþ eek Boesse 
þer schulde ȝe seen expres þat it no dredis
That he is gentil þat doþ gentil dedis
And þerfore deere housebonde I þus conclude
Al were it þat myn ancestres were rude
  
ȝet may þat heye god and so hope I
Graunte me grace to lyue vertuously
Thanne am I gentil whan þat I begynne
To lyuen vertuously and weyuen synne
And þer as ye of pouert me repreue
The hihe god on whom þat we bileeue  
In wilful pouert chese to leese his lijf
And certes euery man and mayde and wijf
May vnderstonde ihesu heuen king
Ne wolde not chese a vicious lyuyng
Glad pouert is an honest þing certeyn
þis wille Senec and oþer clerkes sein
Who so þat holt him payed of his pouert
I holde him riche al hadde he nought cert
he þat coueyteþ is a pouere wight
ffor he wolde han þat nys nat in his might
But he þat nought haþ ne coueyteþ to haue
Is riche al þough men holde him but a knaue
Verray pouert is synne proprely
Iuuenal seiþ of pouert myrily
The pouere man whan he goþ by þe way
Bifore þe þeues he may synge and play
Pouert is hatel good and as I gesse 
A ful gret brynger out of busynesse
A gret amender eek of Sapience
To him þat lackeþ it in pacience
Pouert is þis al þough it seme alenge
Possession þat no wight wol chalenge
Pouert ful often whan a man is lowe
Makeþ his god and eek himself to knowe
Pouert a spectacle is as þinkeþ me
þurgh which he may his verray freendes se
And þerfore syn þat I you nought greue
Of my pouerte nomore me repreue
Now sire of eelde ȝe reproeue me
And certes sire þough non auctorite
  
Were in no book  ȝe gentil of honour
Seyn þat men schulde an old wijf do fauour
And clepe him fader for ȝour gentilnesse 
And auctours schal I fynden as I gesse 
Now þer ȝe seyn þat I am foul and olde
Than drede ȝou nought to ben a cokewolde  
ffor filþe and helþe al so mote I þe
Ben grete wardeyns vpon chastite
But naþeles syn I knowe ȝoure delyt
I schal fulfille your worldly appetyt
Chees now quod sche on of þese þinges tweye 
To han me foule and olde til þat I deye
And be to ȝow a trewe humble wijf
And neuere ȝow displese in alle my lijf
Or elles ȝe wol haue me ȝong and fair
And take ȝour auenture of þe repair
That schal come to your hous by cause of me
Or in som oþer place wel may be
Now chees ȝour seluen wheþer þat ȝou likeþ
þis knight auysed him and sore sikeþ
But atte laste he seyde in þis manere
My lady and my loue and wijf so deere
I putte me in ȝoure wise gouernance
Cheseþ ȝour self which may be most plesance
And most honour to yow and me also
I do no force þe wheþer of þe tuo
ffor as ȝou likeþ it sufficeþ me
þanne haue I gote of ȝou maystrie quod sche
Syn I may cheese and gouerne as me list
ȝe certes wijf quod he I holde it for best
kisse me quod sche we be no lenger wroþe 
ffor by my trouþe I wol be to yow boþe
þis is to sein  to be boþe fair and good
I pray to god þat I mote steruen wood
But I to ȝou be also sad and trewe 
As euer was wijf syn þat þe world was newe
  
And but I be to morwe as fair to seene
As eny lady emperice or queene 
þat is bitwen þe est and eek þe weste 
Do wiþ my lijf and deþ right as ȝou leste
Cast vp þe curteyne loke how it is 
And whanne þat þe knight sawh al þis  
That sche so fair was and so ȝong þerto
ffor ioye he hente hir in his armes tuo
his herte baþed in a baþ of blisse
A þousand tyme a rowe he gan hire kisse
And sche obeyed him in euery þing
That mighte doon him pleisance or likyng
And þus þey lyued vnto here lyues ende
In perfyt ioye and ihesu crist vs sende
housbondes meke ȝonge and freissche abedde
And grace to ouerlede hem þat we wedde
And eek I pray to Ihesu schorte here lyues
That wol not be gouerned by here wyues
And olde and angry nyggardes of dispence
God send hem sone a verray pestilence
This worþy lymytour þis noble ffrere
he made alway lowrynge cheere
vpon þe somnour but for honeste
No vyleynes word as ȝit spak he 
But atte laste he seyde vnto þe wijf
Dame goode god ȝif ȝou right good lijf
Ȝe han touched heer al so mote I þe
In scole matier gret difficulte
Ȝe han seid mochel þing right wel I seye
But dame heere as we ryden by þe weye
Vs nedeþ nat to speken but of game
And late auctoritees a goddes name
To preching and to scole eek of clergie 
But if it like vnto þis companye
I wol ȝou of a somnour telle a game
Parde ȝe may wel knowe by þe name
That of no somnour may no good be sayd
I pray þat non of ȝou be yuele payd
A somnour is a romere vp and doun
Wiþ amendement of fornicacioun
And is ybete at euery townes ende  
Oure host þo spak a sire ȝe scholde ben heende
And curteys as a man of ȝour astat
In companye we wille no debat 
Telleþ ȝoure tale and lateþ þe somnour be
Nay quod þe somnour lat him seye to me
What so him list whan it comþ to my lot
By god I schal him quiten euery grot
I schal him telle such a gret honour
It is to be a flateryng lymytour
And eek of ful many an oþer cryme
Which nedeþ nat rehersen at þis tyme
And his office I schal him telle ywys
Oure host answerde pees nomore of þis
And afterward he seyde vnto þe frere 
Telle forþ ȝoure tale my leue mayster deere

Whilom þer was dwellyng in Couentre
An erchedekne a man of heih degre
That boldely dide execuciōn
In punysschyng of fornicacion
Of wichcraf and eek of Bawderie
Of diffamacion and auoutrie
Of chirche reeues and of testamentes
Of contractes and of lak of sacramentes
Of vsure and Symonye also
But certes lecchours dede he grettest wo
They scholden syngen if þey were hent
And smale tyþeres weren foule yschent
If eny person wolde vpon hem pleyne
Ther might astirte him no pecunial peyne
ffor smale tyþes and eek for smal offrynge
he made þe poeple spitously to synge
ffor or þe bisschop caught hem wiþ his hook
They weren in þe Erchedeknes book
And þanne hadde he þurgh his Iurdiction
Power to don on hem correction
he hadde a somnour redy to his hande  
A sleyere boy was non in engelande
ffor sotilly he hadde his especiaile
That taughte him where þat him mighte auayle
he coude spare of lecchours on or tuo
To techen him to foure and twenty mo
ffor þough þis somnour wood were as an hare
To telle his harlottrie I wil not spare
  
ffor we ben oute of here correction
They han of vs no Iuresdiction
We neuer schullen terme of alle hire lyues
Petur so ben þe wommen of þe Styues
Quod þis Somnour yputt out of oure cure
Pees with meschance and with mysauenture
Thus seyde oure host and let him telle his tale
Now telleþ forþ and late þe somnour gale
Ne spareþ nought myn oughne maister deere
This false þeef þis somnour quod þe ffrere 
hadde alwey bawdes redy to his hond
As eny hauke to lure in Engelond
That telle him al þe secre þat þey knewe
ffor here aqueintance was nat come of newe
þey weren his approwours priuely
he tok himself a gret profyt þerby
his maister knew nat alwey what he wan
Wiþouten maundement of a lewed man
he coude somne on peyne of cristes curs
And þey were ynly gladde to fille his purs
And made him grete festes atte nale
And right as Iudas hadde purses smale
And was a þeef right swich a þeef was he
his mayster hadde but half his dewete
he was if I schal ȝiuen him his laude
A theef and eek a sompnour and a baude
he hadde eek wenches of his retenue
That wheþer þat sir Roberd or sir huwe
Or Iohn or Rauf or who þat it were  
That lay by hem þat tolde it in his eere
Thus was þe wenche and he of oon assent
And he wolde fecche a feyned maundement
And somne hem to þe Chapitre boþe tuo
And pile þe man and late þe wenche go
þanne wolde he seye I schal freend for þy sake
Do strike þe out of oure lettres blake
  
þe þar nomore as in þis cas trauayle
I am þi frend þer I þe may auayle
Certein he knew of briberies mo
þan possible is to telle ȝou vnto
ffor in þis worlde is dogge for no bowe
That knew an hurt deer from an old bite kowe
Than þat þis sompnour knew a sleigh lecchour
Or avouter or elles a paramour
And for þat was þe fruyt of alle þe rent
Therfore on it he sette al his entent
And so bifelle þat ones on a day
This somnour euer waytyng on his pray
Rode for to somne an old wijf a ribibe
ffeynyng a cause for he wolde bribe
And happede þat he seigh byfore hym ryde 
A gay yoman vnder a forest syde
A bowe he bar and arwes bright and keene
he hadde vppon a courtepy of grene 
An hatte vppon his heed wiþ frenges blake
Sire quod þis Sompnour hail and wel atake 
Welcome quod he and euery good felawe
Whider ridestow vnder þis greene schawe
Seyde þis ȝeman wilt þou fer to day
This somnour him answerde and seyde nay
here faste by quod he is myn entente
To ryden for to reysen vp a rente 
It longeþ to my lordes dewete
Art þou þanne a baillif ȝe quod he
he dorste nouȝt for verray filþe and schame  
Seie þat he was a somnour for þe name
Depardieux quod þis ȝoman dere broþer
þou art a bailly and I am anoþer
I am vnknowen as in þis cuntre
Of þin aqueintance I wil preye þe
And eek of breþerhode if þat þou leste
I haue golde and siluer in my cheste
  
If þat þe happed come into oure schire
Al schal be þin right as þou wolt desyre
Graunt mercy quod þis somnour by my feiþ
Euerich in oþeres hond his trouþe leiþ
ffor to be swore broþer til þey deye
and wiþ þat word þey ryden forþ here weye
This somnour wiþ þat was so 
As ful of venym ben þis waryangles
And euer enquiryng vpon euery þing
Broþer quod he wher is ȝoure dwellyng
Anoþer day if I scholde ȝou seche
This ȝoman him answerde in softe speche
Broþer quod he fer in þe Norþ cuntre
Wher as I hope som tyme I schal þe se
Or we departe I schal þe so wel wisse
That of myn hous schalt þou neuer misse 
Now broþer quod þis sompnour I ȝou pray
Teche me whil we ryden by þe way 
Syn þat ȝe ben a baillyf as am I
Som subtilte telle me feiþfully
In myn office how þat I may most wynne
And spareþ not for conscience ne synne
But as my broþer tell me how do ȝe
Now by my trouþe broþer deere seyde he
As I schal tellen þe a feiþful tale 
My wages ben ful streyte and smale 
My lord is hard to me and daungerous
And my office ful laborious
And þerfore by extorciouns I lyue  
ffor soþe I  al þat men wil me ȝiue
Algate be sleigte or violence
ffrom ȝeer to ȝer I wynne al my dispence 
I can no bettre tellen feiþfully
Now certes quod þis sompnour so fare I
I spare not to take god it wot
But if it be to heuy or to hoot
  
What I may gete in counseil priuely
No maner conscience of þat haue I
Ner myn extorcion I might noȝt lyuen
Of swiche iapes wil I nat be schriuen
Stomake ne fro conscience knowe I noon
I schrewe þese schriftefadres euerichon
Wel be we mette by god and by seint Iame
But leeue broþer telle me þanne þy name
Quod þis somnour in þis mene while
This ȝeman gan a litel for to smyle
Broþer quod he wiltow þat I þe telle

And heer I ryde aboute my purchasyng
To wite wher men wil ȝif me eny þing
my purchace is to fette of alle my rente
loke how þou rydest for þe same entente
To wynne good þou rekkest neuer how
Right so fare I for ryde wolde I now

A quod þis somnour benedicite what ȝe seye

Ȝe han a mannes schappe as wel as I

In helle þer ȝe ben in ȝoure estat
Nay certeinly quod he þer han we noon
But whan vs likeþ we can take vs oon
Or elles make ȝou wene we ben schape
Som tyme  a man or like an ape 
Or lik an aungel can I ryde or go  
It is no wonder þing þough it be so
A lousy iogulour can deceyue þe
And par de ȝit can I more craft þan he 
Why quod þis somnour ryde ȝe þanne or gon
In sondry schappe and nat alwey in oon
ffor we quod he wille vs swich forme make
As most able is oure prayes for to take
  
What makeþ ȝou to han al þis labour

Seyde þis feend but al þing haþ tyme
The day is schort and it is passed prime
And ȝet ne wan I no þing in þis day

And nat entende oure wittes to declare
ffor broþer myn þi witte is al to bare
To vnderstonde þough I tolde hem þe
But for þou axest whi labouren we

And menes to do his comaundementz
Whan þat him list vpon his creatures
In diuerse acte and in diuers figures
Wiþouten him we han no might certayn
If þat him liste to stonden þer agayn
And som time at oure praye han we leue
Only þe body and not þe soule greeue 
Witnesse on Iob whom þat we dyden wo
And som tyme han we might of boþe tuo

And som tyme we ben suffred for to seeke

Nat his body and al is for þe beste
Whan he wiþstondeþ oure temptacion
It is a cause of his saluacion
Al be it þat it was not oure entente

And som tyme be we seruantz vnto man  
As þe erchebisschope seint Dunstan
And to þe apostles seruant was I

Make ȝe ȝow newe bodyes þus alwey
Of elementz þe feend answerde nay
Som tyme we feyne and som tyme we arise 
Wiþ dede bodyes in ful sondry wise
  
And speke as renabely and faire and wel

And ȝit wol some men say it was nat he

But o þing warne I þe I wil nat Iape

To which þe somnour schop him for to wende

And þey bygonne to drawe and to stoupe

And panne and al but he wil him repente
Nay olde stot þat is not myn entente
Quoþ þis somnour for to repente me

And wiþ þat word þis foule feend him hent
Body and soule he with þe deuyl went
Where þat somnours han here heritage
And god þat made after his ymage
Mankynde saue and gyde vs alle and some
And leeue þis somnour good man to bycome

hadde I had leysir for þis somnour heere
After þe tixte of crist poule and Iohn
And of oure oþer doctours many oon
Suche peynes þat ȝoure hertes might agrise
Al be it so no tonge may deuyse 
þough þat I might a þousand wynter telle

But for to kepe vs fro þat cursed place
Wakeþ and prayeþ ihesu for his grace
So kepe vs fro þe temptour Sathanas
herkneþ þis word be war as in þis cas

To sle þe Innocent if þat he may
Disposeþ ay ȝour hertes to wiþstonde

ffor crist wille be ȝour champion and knight
And preyeþ þat þis somnour him repente
Of his mysdede or þat þe feend him hente
This Somnour in his styrop heyhe stood
Vpon þis frere his herte was so wood
That lik an aspen leef he quok for Ire
lordynges quod he but o þing I desire 
I ȝou beseche þat of ȝour curtesye
Siþ ȝe han herde þis false frere lye
As suffreþ me I may a tale telle
This frere bosteþ þat he knoweþ helle
And god wot þat it is litel wonder
ffreres and feendes ben but litel asonder
ffor parde ȝe han ofte tyme herd telle
how þat a frere rauyssched was in helle
In spirit ones by avisioun
And as an aungel ladde him vp and doun
To schewen him þe peynes þat þer were
In alle þe place saugh he nat a ffrere  
Of oþer folk he saugh ynowe in woo
Vnto þis aungel spak þe frere þo
Now sire quod he han freres such a grace 
That non of hem schal come to þis place 
Ȝis quod þis aungel many a milioun
And vnto Sathanas he hadde him doun
And now haþ Sathanas saiþ he a taile
Bradder þan of þe Caryk is þe saile
hold vp þi tayl þou Satanas quod he 
Schew forþ þin ersand lat þe frere se 
Wher is þe neste of ffreres in þis place
And er þat half a forlong wey of space
  
Right so as bees swermen out of an hyue
Out of þe deueles ers þey gon to dryue
Twenty þousand freres on a route
And þoughte helle swarme al aboute
And camen aȝein as faste as þey mighte gon
And in his ers þey crepeden euerichon

This frere whan he loked hadde his fille
vppon þis tormentes of þis sory place 
his spirit god restored of his grace 
Vnto his body aȝein and he awok
But naþeles for feere ȝit he quok
So was þe deueles ars ay in his mynde
þat is his heritage of verray kinde
God saue ȝow alle saue þis cursed frere 
My prologe wol I ende in þis manere 

LOrdynges þer is in york schire  as I gesse
A mersshy countre called Holdernesse
In which þer wente a lymytour aboute 
To preche and eek to begge it is no doute
And so bifelle þat on a day þis frere
Hadde preched atte cherche in þis manere
And specially abouen euery þing  
Excited he þe poeple in his preching
To trentales and for goddes sake
Therwith men mighten holy houses make
Ther as diuin seruice is honoured
Nought þer as it is wasted and deuoured
Ne þer it nedeþ not for to be ȝiue
As to possessioners þat may elles lyue
þanked be god in wele and habundance
Trentales seyde he deliuereþ fro penance
here frendes soules as wel olde as ȝonge
If þat þey ben hastily ysonge
Nought for to holde a prest ioly and gay
he syngeþ not but o messe in a day
Delyuereþ out quod he anon þe soules

Now speed ȝou hastely for cristes sake
to kepe ȝou fro peynes of feendes blake
And whan þe frere hadde seyde al his entente

Wiþ scrippe and tipped staf tukked ful hye
In euery hous he gan to pore and prye
And beggeþ mele or chese or elles corn

A payre of tabeles of yuory
And a poyntel polisshed fetously
And wrot þe names alwey as he stood
Of any folk þat ȝaf hem eny good
Ascance þat he wolde for hem preye

A goddes kechil or a trippe of chese
Oþer elles what ȝow list we may nat cheese
A goddes halpeny oþer a masse peny
Oþer ȝiue vs of ȝour bran if ȝe haue eny
A dagoun of ȝour blanket leeue dame  
Oure suster deere here I write ȝoure name

A sturdy harlot wente hem ay behynde
That was here hostes man and bar a sakke
And what men ȝaf hem leyde it on his bakke
And whan he was out at þe dore anoon

That he bifore hadde writen in his tables

Nay þer þou lixt þou somnour quod þe frere 
Pees quod oure host for cristes moder deere
Telle forþ þi tale spare it not at al
So þryue I quod þis somnour so I schal
So longe he wente hous by hous quod he
Til he come to an hous þer he was wont to be
Refresshed more þan in an C places
Seke lay þe bonde man whos þe place is
And vpon a kowche lowe he lay

God woot quod he laboured haue I ful sore
And specially for þy Saluacion

And for oure oþer frendes god hem blesse  
I haue to day don at ȝoure chirche a messe
A sayd a sermon after my simple wit

Chydeþ him wel for god in trinite

And ouer him leye my legg or arm

Oþer desport of him right non haue I

In myn avision so god me wisse
So dede our sextein and oure fermorer  
That han ben trewe freres fyfty ȝeer
They may now god by þanke of his lone

And vp I ros and alle oure couent eeke
With many a teere trillyng on my cheeke

And borell solke

And dyuerse guerdon hadde þey þerby
Whoso wol preye he moot faste and be clene
And fatte his soule and make his cheekes lene
  
We fare as seiþ þapostil cloþ and foode

With empty wombe fastyng many a day
Receyued he þe lawe þat was writen
Wiþ goddes fynger and helthe wel ȝe witen
In þe mont or elles er he hadde eny speche
With heyhe god þat is oure lyues leche

And aaron þat hadde þe temple of god in gouernance
And eek þat oþer prestes euerichon
Into þe temple whan þey scholden gon
To praye for þe poeple and do seruise  
They nolden drynken in no maner wise
No drynk þe which hem mighte drunke make
But euere in abstynence to preye and wake

But þey ben sobre þat for þe poeple preye
Ware þat I say no more for it suffiseþ
Oure lord ihesus  as holy god deuyseþ

Therfore we mendinantz we pouere freres
Ben wedded to pouert and to continence
To charite humblesse and also pacience
To persecucion for rightwisnesse 
To wepyng misericorde and clennesse
And þerfore may ȝe see þat oure prayeres
I speke of vs we mendenante ffreres
Ben to þe hihe god more acceptable
Than ȝoures wiþ ȝoure feste at þe table
ffro paradys first if I schal nought lye
Was man out chaced for his glotonye
  
And chast was man in paradys certayn
But herkne þere what I schal ȝou sayn
I haue no text of þat as I suppose
But I schal fynde it in a maner glose
That specially oure swete lord Ihesus
Spak þus by vers whan he seyde þus
Blessed ben þey þat pore in spirit ben
And so forþ al þe gospel may ȝe seen
Wher it be like oure profession
Or hem þat swymmen in possession

And for here lewednesse I hem diffye
Me þinkeþ þey ben like Iovinian

As vynolent as botel in þe spence
here prayer is ful of gret reuerence
Whan þey for soules sein þe psalme of dauid  
lo buff þey sain cor meum eructauit
Who folweþ cristes gospel and his lore
But we þat humble be and chaste and pore
Werkers of goddes word and eek auditoures 
þerfore right as an hauke rype at a sours
vp springeþ vnto þe ayre right so prayeres
Of charitable and chaste besy freres
maken here sours to goddes eeren and who
Thomas þerfore so mote I ride or go
And by þat god þat cleped is seint yue
Nere þou oure broþer schuldest þou not þriue
In oure chapitre praye we day and night
To crist þat he sende þe hele and might
Thy body for to welden hastily
God wot quod he noþing þerof wot I
As helpe me crist as in fewe ȝeeres
haue I spended vpon diuers maner freres
fful many a pound ȝit fare I neuer þe bett
Certein my good haue I almost bisett
  
ffar wel my golde for it is al ago
The ffrere answerde o Thomas why dost þou so
What needeþ ȝou diuerse freres to seche
What needeþ him þat haþ a parfit leche
To sechen oþer leches in þe toun
ȝour inconstance is ȝour confusioun
holde ȝe þen me or elles oure couent
To preye for ȝou ben insufficient
Thomas þat Iape is not worþ a myte
ȝoure maladye is for ȝe han ȝiuen vs so lite
A ȝif þat couent half a quarter otes
A ȝiue hem one or tuo grotes
A ȝiue þe frere a peny and let him go
Nay nay Thomas it may no þing be so
What is a ferþing worþ parted in twelue
lo eche þing þat is oned by himselue
Is more straunge þen when it is skatered  
Thomas of me þou schalt nat be flatered
þou woldest oure labour haue for nought
The hihe god þat al þis world haþ wrought
Seiþ þat þe werkman is worþi his hyre
Thomas nought of ȝour tresore I desire
As for my self but þat alle oure couent
To pray for ȝou is ay so diligent
And for to bulden cristes oughne chirche
Thomas if ȝe wol lerne for to wirche
Of buldyng vp of chirches may ȝe fynde
If it be good in Thomas lijf of Inde
Ȝe ligge heer ful of anger and of Ire
With þe which þe deuyl sette ȝoure ers a fyre
And chyden heere þis sely Innocent
Ȝoure wijf þat is so meeke and pacient
And þerfore Thomas trowe me if ȝou list
Ne stryue not wiþ þy wijf al for þe beste
And bere þis word awey now by þy feith
Touchinge such þing lo what þe wise man seiþ
  
Wiþinne þin hous ne be þou no leoun
To þy subiectis do non oppressioun
Ne make þin acqueintance not for to fle
And Thomas ȝit eft sones say I þe
Be war for hire þat in þy bosom slepeþ
Be war of þe serpent þat so slyly crepeþ
vnder þe grasse þat styngeþ subtilly
Be war my sone and herkene paciently
That xxti þousand men han lost here lyues 
ffor þat þei han ben spitous to here wyues
Now siþ ȝe han so holy and so meeke a wijf
What needeþ ȝou Thomas to make strif
þer is ywys no serpent so cruel
Whan men trede on his tail ne half so fel
As womman is whan sche haþ caught an Ire
Vengance is þanne al þat þey desyre
Ire is a synne on of þe grete of seuene  
Abhominable vnto þe god of heuene
And to himself it is destruction
þis euery lewed vicary or parson
Can say how Ire engendreþ homicide
Ire in soþ is executor of pryde
I couþe of Ire seye so mochil sorwe
My tale scholde laste til to morwe
And þerfore I praye god boþe day and night
An Irous man sende him litel might
It is gret harm and certes gret pite
To sette an Irous man in heih degre
 Whilom þer was an Irous potestat
As seiþ Senek durynge his estat
Vpon a day out riden knightes tuo
And as fortune wolde it were so
That oon of hem cam home þat oþer nought
Anon þe knight bifore þe Iuge is brought
And seyde þus þou hast þy felaw slayn
ffor which I deme þe to deþ certain
  
And to anoþer knight comaunded he
Go lede him to þe deþ I charge þe
And happed as þey wente by þe weye
Toward þe place þer as he schulde deye
The knight cam which þey wend hadde be deed
Thenne þoughten þey it were þe beste reed
To lede hem boþe to þe Iuge aȝein
þey seyden lord þe knight ne haþ not sleyn
his felawe here he stant on lyue
ȝe schulle be deed quod he so mot I þriue
þis is to say boþe oon and tuo and þre
And to þe firste knight right þus spak he
I dampned þe þou most algate be deed
And þou also most needes lese þin heed
ffor þou art cause why þy felaw deyþ
And to þe þridde knight right þus he seiþ
Thou hast not don þat I comaunded þe  
And þus he dede do slee hem alle þre
Irous kambises was eek drunkelewe
And ay delited him to ben a schrewe
And so bifelle a lord of his meigne
That loued vertuous moralite
Sayde on a day vnto himself right þus
A lord is lost if he be vicious
And drunkenesse is eek a foul record
Of any man and namly in a lord
Ther is ful many an ey and many an eere
Awaytyng on a lord and he not where
ffor goddes loue drynkeþ more attemperelly
Wyn makeþ a man to lese wrecchedly

The reuers schalt þou see quod he anoon
And proue it by þin owne experience
That wyn doþ to folk no such offence
Ther is no wyn byreueþ me my might
Of hande ne foot ne of myn eyȝen sight
  
And for despite he dranke ful moche more
An hundred part þan he had don bifore
And right anon þis cursede wrecche
lete þis knightes sone biforn him fecche
And commaundyng hem þey schulde biforn him stonde
And sodeinly he took his bowe on honde
And vp þe streng he pulled to his eere
And wiþ an arwe he slough þe child right þere
Now wheþer haue I a siker hond or non
Quoþ he is al my might and my witte agon
haþ wyn byreued me myn yhe sight
What schulde I telle þe answere of þe knight
his sone was slayn þer is namore to say
Beþ war þerfore wiþ lordes how ȝe play
Syngeþ placebo and I schal if I can
But if it be vnto a pouere man
To a pouere man men scholde his vices telle   
But not to a lord þei he schulde go te helle 
Lo Irrous Sirus þilke Percien
how he destroyed þe ryuer of Gysen
ffor þat an hors of his was dreynt þerinne
Whan þat he wente Babilon to wynne
he made þat þe ryuer was so smal
That wommen mighten waden oueral
lo what seyde he þat so wel teche can
Ne he no felawe to an yrous man
Ne wiþ no wood man walke by þe way
leste þe repente I wol nomore say
Now Thomas leeue broþer leue þin Ire
Thou schalt me fynde as iuste as is a squire

Thin anger doþ þe al to sore smerte
But schewe to me alle þy confession
Nay quod þis seeke man by seint Symon
I haue ben schriuen þis day at my curate
I haue him tolde al holly myn estate
  
It needeþ nomore speke of it sayde he
But if me luste of myn humilite
Ȝiue me þenne of þy gold to make oure cloystre
Quod he for many a muscle and many an oystre
haþ ben our foode oure cloystre for to reyse
Whan oþer men han ben ful wel at eyse
And ȝit god wot vnneþes þe foundement
Parformed is ne of oure pauyment
Nis nought a tile ȝit wiþinne oure wones
By god we owen fourty pound for stoones
Now helpe thomas for him þat harwed helle
Or elles moote we oure bokes selle
And if we lacke oure predicacion
þanne goþ þe world al to destruccion
ffor whos wolde fro þis world vs byreue
So god me saue Thomas by ȝoure leeue
he wolde byreue out of þe world þe sonne   
ffor who can teche and werchen as we konne
And þat is not of litel time quod he
But sethyns Elye was or Elyze

In charite Iþanked be oure lord
Now Thomas help for seinte charite
Adoun anon he sette him on his kne
This sike man wex wel neigh wood for Ire
he wolde þat þe frere hadde ben a fuyre
With his fals dissimilacion
Such þing as is her in my possession
Quod he þat I may ȝiue and non oþer
ȝe sein me þus  þat I am ȝour broþer
ȝe certes quod þe ffrere trusteþ me wel
I took oure dame oure lettres wiþ oure seel
 Now wel quod he and somwhat schal I ȝiue

And in þin hand þou schalt it han anon

That euery frere haue as moche as oþer

I swere it quod þis frere vpon my feiþ
And þer wiþal his hond in his he leiþ

Sayde þis man and grope wel byhynde
Byneþe my buttok þere schalt þou fynde
A þing þat I haue hidde in priuete
A þought þis frere þat schal go wiþ me
And doun his hande he launceþ vnto þe clifte
he hopede þere for to fynden a ȝifte
And þanne ful besy was þis frere
Abouten his tuwel gropyng here and þere
 Amydde his hand he leet þe frere a fart  
Ther is no capel drawyng in þe cart
þat might haue lete a fart of such a soun
þe frere vp sterte as it were a fers leoun
A false cherl quod he for cokkes bones
This hast þou for despite doon for þe nones
þou schalt abeye þi farte if þat I may
his meigne which þat herden þis affray
Cam lepynge in and chased out þe ffrere
And forþ he goþ wiþ a ful angry cheere
And fette his felawe þer as lay his store
he loked as it were a wilde boor
he grynded his teeþ so was he wroþ
A stourdy paas doun to þe court he goþ
Wher as þer woned a man of gret honour
To whom þat he was alwey confessour
This worþy man was lord of þat village
þis frere cam as þough it were in a rage
Wher as þis lord sat etyng at his bord
vnneþes might þe frere speke a word
  
Til atte laste he seyde god ȝou se

Quod he frere Iohn what maner world is þis
I see wel þat som þing is amys

Sit doun anon and telle me what ȝour greef is
And it schal ben amended if þat I may
I haue quod he had a despit to day
God ȝelde ȝou adoun in ȝoure village
þat in þis world is non so pore a page

Of þat I haue receyued in þis toun
And ȝit me greueþ no þing so sore
As þat þis olde cherl wiþ lokkes hore
Blasphemed haþ oure holy couent eeke
Now maister quod þis lord I ȝou beseke
No maister quod he but a seruitour  
þey I haue had in scole þat honour
God likeþ nouȝt þat men vs Raby calle

No force quod he but telle me of ȝour greef
sire quod þis frere an ydious mescheef
This day betidde is to myn ordre and to me
And so par consequens to eche degre
Of holy chirche god amende it sone
Sire quod þe lord ȝe wot what is to doone
Distempre ȝou nought ȝe be my confessour

Telleþ me ȝour greef and he anon him tolde
As ȝe han herd byfore ȝe wot wel what
The lady of þe hous ay stille sat
Til sche hadde herde what þe frere sayde
Ey goddes moder quod sche blisful mayde

I holde him in a maner frenesye
Madame quod he by god I schal not lye
but I on oþer wise may ben awreke
I schal sclaundre him oueral wher I speke
The false blasphemour þat charged me
To parte þat might nouȝt departed be
To euery man yliche wiþ meschaunce
þe lord sat stille as he lay in a traunse
And in his herte he rolled vp and doun
how hadde þis cherl ymaginacioun
To schewe such a probleme to þe frere
Neuer erst er now herde I of such matere
I trowe þe deuyl putte it in his mynde  
In ars metrik schal þer no man fynde
Biforn þis day of such a question
Who schulde make a demonstracion

Of a soun or of a sauour of a fart
O nyce proude cherle I schrewe his face
lo sires quod þe lord wiþ harde grace
Who herde euer of such a þing er now 
To euery man ylike telle me how
It is a impossible it may not be
O nyce cherle god let him neuer þe

Nys but of eyre reuellacioun
And þerwiþ wasteþ litel and litel away

If þat it were departed equaly
What lo my cherle lo ȝit how schrewedely

Now eteþ ȝoure mete and leteþ him go pleye

Now stood þe lordes squier at þe bord

Of alle þing of which I haue ȝou sayd

Schal holde his nose vpright vnto þe naue

As any tabour hider ben ybrought
And sette him on þe wheel right on þis carte
vpon þe naue and make him lete a farte
And ȝe schuln se vp peril of my lijf
By preof which þat is demonstratif

And eeke þe stynke vnto þe spokes ende

And so wolde alle his couent hardily

As fer as reson axeþ hardel
I wil ȝou telle a tale which þat I

As preued by his wordes and his werk

I pray to god to ȝiue his soule reste
ffraunces Petrake þe laureat poete
highte þis clerk whos retorique sweete

as Lynyan dide  of Philosophie
or lawe  or other arte particulere
but deth that wol not suffre vs  duelle here
but as it were  a twynkelyng of an yghe
hem both hath sleyn  and alle shulle we dye
but forthe to tellen  of this worthy man
that taughte me this tale  as I bigan
I sey that he first  wight highe stile enditeth
er he the body of his tale writeth
a proheme  in the which discerneth he
the mounde  and of Saluce the contre
and spekith of Appenyn the hilles highe
that ben the boundes  of west Lumbardie
and of the Mounte Vesulus  in special
where as the Poo  out of a wel smal
takith his first spryngyng  and his sours
and holte even streighte wey  his cours
to Emelward  to Ferrare  and to Venyse
the which a longe thing were  to devise
and trewely  as to my Iugement
me thinkith it a thing  inpertynent
save he wol conveye  his matiere
but this is the tale  which ye shal hiere
Ther was in the weste side of ytaylle
down at the rote  of Vesulus the colde
a lusty playne  habundaunte of vitaylle
where many a toure and towne  thow maist biholde
that founded were  in tyme of faders olde
and many another  dilectable sight
and Saluces  this noble contre hight
A Marques whilom  was lord of that londe
as were his worthi eldres  him bifore
and obeysaunte  ay redy to his honde
were alle his liges  both lesse and more  
thus in delite he lyved  and hath done yore
biloued and drad  thorugh favour of fortune
both of his lordis  and of his comune
 Therwith he was  to speken of lynage
the gentilest borne  of al Lumbardye
a faire persone and strong  and yonge of age
and ful of honoure  and of curtesie
discrete Inough  his contre for to gye
saue in som thingis  he was to blame
and Walter was this yonge lordis name
 I blame him thus  that he considred noughte
in tyme comyng  what myghte him betide
but on his lust present  was al his thoughte
as for to havke and hounte  on euery side
wel nygh al other cures  lete he slide
and eke he nolde  and that was worst of alle
wedde no wiff  for aughte that myghte bifalle
  
 Oonly that poynt  his peple bare soore
that flokmele on a day  they to him wente
and oon of hem  that wysest was of loore
or ellis that the lord  best wolde assente
that he shulde telle him  what his peple mente
or ellis coude he wel  shewe suche matire
he to the Marques seide  as ye shulle hire
 O noble Marques  youre humanite
assurith vs  and yevith vs hardynesse
as offte as tyme  is of necessite
that we to yow mow telle  oure hevynesse
acceptith now lord  of youre gentilnesse
that we with pitevous herte  to yow pleyne
and lete not youre eeris  my voys disdeyne
 Al haue I nought to done  in this matire
more than another man hath  in this place
yit for as meche  as ye my lord  so dere
haue alwey shewed to me  favoure and grace
I dar the better axe of yow  a space  
of audience  to shewe oure requeste
and ye my lord  to do right as ye leste
 For certes lord  so wel vs likith yow
and al youre werke  and haue done that we
Ne coude nought vs self deuysen how  
We mighte lyue in more felicite
Saue o þing lord if it ȝour wille be
That for to be a wedded man ȝou leste
þen were ȝoure peple in souereyn hertes reste
Boweþ ȝoure nekke vnder þat blisful ȝok
Of souerainte and nought of seruise
Which þat men clepe spousaile or wedlok
And þenkeþ lord amonges ȝoure þoughtes wise
  

ffor þough we slepe or wake or renne or ryde
Ay fleeþ þe tyme and wol noman abyde
And þough ȝoure greene þoughtes floure as ȝit
In crepeþ age alway as stille as stoon
And deth manaceþ euery age and smyt
In ech astat for þer askapeþ noon
And also certein as we knowe echoon
þat we schulle deye as vncertein we alle
Ben of þat day þat deþ schal on vs falle
 Accepteþ þanne of vs þe trewe entent
þat neuere ȝit ne refused ȝour heste
And we lord if þat ȝe wile assent
To chese ȝou a wijf in schort tyme atte leste
Borne of þe gentilest and of þe meste
Of alle þis lond so þat it oughte seme
honour to god and ȝou as we can deme
 Delyuer vs out of al þis busy dede
And tak a wijf for hihe goddes sake
ffor if it so bifelle as god forbede
þat þorugh ȝoure deþ ȝour lynage schulde slake
And þat a straunge successour schulde take
ȝoure heritage o wo were vs on lyue
wherfore we pray ȝow hastily to wyue
 here meke preyer and here pitous cherte
Made þe marquys herte haue pite

To þat I neuer erst þouȝte streyne me
I me reioysed of my liberte
That selden tyme is founden mariage  
Ther I was free I moste be in seruage
  
 But naþeles I se ȝour trewe entente
And truste vpon ȝour witte and haue don ay
Wherfore with al my fre wille I wil assente
To wedde me as sone as euer I may
But þer as ȝe han profred me to day
To chese me a wijf I ȝou relesse
þat choys and pray ȝou of ȝoure profre cesse
 ffor I wot þat children often ben
vnlike here eldres hem byfore
Bounte comþ al of god not of þe stren
Of which þei beþ engendred and ybore
I truste in goddes bounte and þerfore
my mariage and myn astat and reste
I him bitake he may do as him leste
 lat me alone in chesyng of my wijf
But I ȝou pray and charge vpon ȝour lijf
That charge vpon my bak I wil endure
þat what wijf I take I þe assure
To worschipe hire whil þat hire lijf may dure
In word in werk boþe heere and euerywhere
As sche an Emperoures doughter were
 And forþermore þis schal ȝe swere þat ȝe
Aȝein my choys schulle neuer grucche ne stryue
ffor siþþe I schal forgo my liberte
At ȝoure request as euer mote I þriue

And but ȝe wol assente in such manere
I pray ȝou speke nomore of þis matiere
 Wiþ hertly wil þey sweren and assenten
To al þis þing þer seyde no wight nay
Beseking him of grace or þat þei wenten
þat he wolde graunten hem a certein day
  
Of his spousaile as sone as euer he may
ffor ȝet alway þe poeple somwhat dredde
lest þat þis marquys no wijf wolde wedde
He graunted hem a day such as him leste  
On which he wolde be wedded sikerly
And sayde he dide al þis at þair requeste
And þay wiþ humble entent ful buxomly
knelyng vpon here knees ful reuerently
him þonkyng alle and þus þay haue an ende
Of here entent and home aȝein þei wende
And her vpon he to his officers
Comandeþ for þe feste to purveye
And to his priue knightes and squyers
Such charge ȝaf as him list on hem leye
And þay to his comaundement obeye
And ech of hem doþ al his diligence
To do vnto þe feste reuerence
NOught fer fro þe paleys honurable
Wher as þe marquys schop his mariage
Ther stood a throop of þe Cite delitable
In which þat pore folk of þat village
hadden here bestes and here herbergage
And of here labour toke here sustienance
After þe erþe ȝaf hem abundance
Among þis pore folk þer dwelled a man
Which was holde pouerest of hem alle
But heihe god sum tyme sende can
his grace in to a litel oxe stalle
Ianicula men of þat throop him calle
A doughter hadde he fair ynough to sight
 And Grisildis þis ȝonge mayden highte
  
But for to speke of verteuous beaute
þanne was sche on þe fairest vnder sonne
fful pouerely yfostered was sche
No likerous lust was in hire herte ronne
Wel oftere of þe welle þan of þe tonne
Sche drank for sche wolde vertues plese
Sche knew wel labour but non ydel ese
 But þough þis mayden tendre were of age
ȝet in þe brest of hire virginite  
Ther was yclosed rype and scharpe corage
And in a gret reuerence and charite
hire olde pouere fader fostred sche
A fewe scheep spynnyng on feld sche kepte
Sche nolde not ben ydel til þat sche slepte
And whan sche com homward sche wolde bringe
Wortes or oþer herbes tymes ofte
The which sche schredde and seth for hir lyuynge
And made hir bed ful harde and no þing softe 
And ay sche kepte hir faderes lif on lofte
Wiþ euery obeissance and diligence
That childe may do to faderes reuerence 
 vpon Grisilde þe pouer creature
fful ofte siþe þe marquys sette his ye
As he on huntyng rood perauenture
And whan it fell þat he might hir aspye
he not wiþ wantoun lokyng of folye
his eyen caste on hire but in sad wyse
vpon hir cheere he wolde him ofte auyse
 Commendyng in his herte hir wommanhede
And eek hire vertu passyng any wight
Of so ȝong age as wel in cheere as in dede
ffor þough þe poeple haue no gret insight
  
In vertu he considerd ful right
hir bounte and disposed þat he wolde
Wedde hir oonly if euer he wedde scholde
The day of weddyng com but no wight can
Telle what womman þat it schulde be
ffor which meruayle wondreþ many man
And seyde whan þey were in pryuyte
Wil nat oure lord ȝit leue his vanite
Wil he nat wedde allas allas þe while
Why wol he þus himself and vs begile
But naþeles þis marquys haþ don make
Of gemmes sette in golde and in asure
Broches and rynges for Grisildes sake  
And of hire cloþing tok he þe mesure
Of a mayden like to hire stature
And eek of oþer ornamentes alle
That vnto such a weddyng schulde falle
 þe tyme of vnderne of þe same day
Approcheþ þat þis weddyng schulde be
And al þe paleys but was in aray
Boþe halle and chambre eche in his degre
houses of offices stuffed wiþ plente
Ther maystow se of deynteuous vitayle
That may be founde as feer as last ytayle
 This real marquys richely arrayed
lordes and ladyes in his companye
The which vnto þe feste were prayed
And of his retenue þe bachelrie
With many a soun of sondry melodye
vnto þe vilage of which I tolde
In þis array þe righte wey haþ holde
  
 Grisilde of þis god wot ful Innocent
þat for hire schapen al þis array was
To fecche water at a welle is wente
And comeþ home as sone as euer sche may
ffor wel sche hadde herd seyde þat ilke day
That marquys schulde wedde and if sche might
Sche wolde fayn han seyn some of þat sight
 Sche þought I wille wiþ oþre maydens stonde

The marquisesse and þerfore wol I fonde
To do at home as sone as it may be
þe labour which þat longeþ vnto me
And þanne I may at leysyr hire byholde
If sche þis wey vnto þe castel holde
 And as sche wolde ouer hire þresshfold gon
The marquys cam and gan hir for to calle
And sche sette doun hir water potte anon·
Bysyde þis þresshfolde of þis oxe stalle  
And doun vpon hir knees sche gan to falle
Wiþ sad contynance and kneleþ stille
Til sche had herd what was þe lordes wille
þis þoughtful marquys spak vnto þis mayde
fful soberly and seyde in þis manere
Wher is ȝour fader Grisildis he sayde
And sche wiþ reuerence in humble chere
Answerde lord he is al redy heere
And in sche goþ wiþoute lenger lette
And to þe marquys hir fader sche fette
 he by þe hond þan took þis olde man
And sayde þus whan he him hadde a syde
Ianycala I neyþer may ne can
lengere þe plesaunce of myn herte hyde
  
If þat þou vouche saff what so betyde
þy doughter I wol take or þat I wende
As for my wijf vnto hire lyues ende
 þou louest me I wot it wel certain
And art my feiþful liege man ybore
And al þat likeþ me I dar wel sayn
It likeþ þe and specialliche þerfore
Telle me þat poynt as I haue sayd bifore
If þat þou wilt vnto þat purpos drawe
To take me as for þi sone in lawe
 The sodeyn cas þe man astoned so
þat reed he wax abayst and al quakynge
he stood vnneþe he sayde worde no mo
But only þus lord quod he my willynge
Is as ȝe wille nought aȝeins ȝour likynge
I wole noþing ȝe be my lord so dere
But as ȝou luste gouerneþ þis matiere
 ȝit wol I quod þis marquys softely
þat in þi chambre I and þou and sche
haue a collacion and wostow why
ffor I wil axe if þat hire wille be
To be my wijf and reule hire after me  
And al þis schal be doon in þi presence
I wol not speke out of þin audience
 And in here chambre whil þay were aboute
here tretees which þat ȝe schul after heere
þe poeple cam in to þe hous wiþoute
And wondred hem in hor honeste manere
And tentyfly sche kepte hir fader deere
But outerly Grysildis wondre might
ffor neuer erst ne saugh sche such a sight
  
 No wonder is þouȝ þat sche were astoned
To se so gret a geste in þat place
Sche neuer was to suche gestes woned
ffor which sche loked wiþ ful pale face
But schortly forþ þis mater for to chace
This aren þe wordes þat þe marquys sayde
To his benigne verray feyþful mayde
 Grisilde he seyde ȝe schule wel vnderstonde
It likeþ to ȝoure fader and to me
That I ȝou wedde and eek it may so stonde
As I suppose ȝe wil þat it so be
But þese demaundes ax I first quod he
 þat siþþen it schal be don in hasty wise
Wille ȝe assente or elles ȝou auyse
I seye þis be redy wiþ good herte
To al my lust and þat I frely may
As me best þinkeþ do ȝou knowe or smerte
And neuer þe to grucche it night ne day
And eek whan I say ȝe ne say not nay
Neiþer by word ne by frounyng contynance
Swere þis and heer I swere oure alliance
 Weddyng vpon þis word quakyng for drede
Sche sayde lord vndigne or vnworþy
Am I to þat ilke honour þat ȝe me bede
But as ȝe wille ȝoure self right so wol I
And here I swere þat neuer willyngly
In werk ne þought I nyl ȝou disobeye  
ffor to be deed þough me were loþ to deye
 This is ynough Grisylde myn quod he
And forþ he goþ wiþ a ful sobre cheere
Out at þe dore and after þat cam sche
And to þe poeple he sayde in þis manere
  
þis is my wyf quod he þat stondeþ heere
honoureþ hire and loueþ eek I preye
Who so me loueþ þer is no more to seye
And for þat noþing of hir olde gere
Sche scholde bringe in to his hous he bad
That wommen schulde dispoylen hire right þere
Of which þis ladyes were noþing glad
To handle hire cloþes wher Inne sche was clad
But naþeles þis mayden bright of hewe
ffro foot to heed þey cloþed han al newe
 hire heres han þey kempte þat layn vntressed
fful rudely and wiþ hire fyngres smale
þay tyred hire heed þat longe rudely lay dressed
Of hire array what schulde I make a tale
Sche is now fair of hew þat arst was pale
vnneþe þe poeple hir knew for hir fairnesse
Whan sche transmewed was in such richesse
 This marquys haþ hir wedded wiþ a ryng
Brouȝt for þe same cause and hire sette
vpon an hors snow whyt and wel amblyng
And to þe paleys or he lenger lette
Wiþ ioyful poeple þat hire ladde and mette
Conueyed hire and þus þe day þay spende
In reuel til þe sonne gan descende
 And schortly forþ þis tale for to chace
I seye þat to þis newe marquysesse
God haþ such fauour sent hire of his grace
That it ne semed nought be kykenesse
That sche was born and fedde in iudenesse
As in a cote or in an Oxe stalle
But norisshed in an emperoures halle    
 To euery wight sche woxen is so deere
And worschipful þat folk þer sche was bore
And from hire burþe knewe hire þere by ȝeere
vnneþe trowede þey but durst han swore
þat to Ianicle of which I spak byfore
Sche doughter nas for as by coueiture
hem þoughte sche was anoþer creature
 ffor þough euere vertuous was sche
Sche was encressed in such excellence
Of þewes good ysette in heih bounte
And so discrete and fair of eloquence
So benigne and digne of reuerence
And coude so þe poeples herte embrace
þat ech hir loueþ þat lokeþ on hir face
 Not only of salues in þe toun
Pirplissched was þe bounte of hir name
But eek besyde in many a region
If on sayde wel anoþer sayde þe same
So spredeþ of hire heih bounte and fame
That men and wommen als wel ȝonge as olde
Gon to salice vpon hir to byholde
 Thus Walter lowly nat but really
Wedded wiþ fortunate honeste
In goddes pees lyueþ ful esily
At hom and outward grace ynough hadde he
And for he saugh þat vnder lough degre
Was ofte vertu hyd þe poeple him helde
A prudent man and þat is seyn ful seelde
 Nat oonly þis Grisildis þurgh hir witte
Coude al þe fait of wyfly homlynesse
But eke whan þat þe cas requyred it
The comun profyt coude sche redresse
  
þer nas discorde rancour ne heuynesse
In al þat lond þat sche couþe appese
And wisly bringe hem alle in hertes eese
 Though þat hire housbonde absent were anon  
If gentil men or oþer of hire countre 
Were wroþe sche wolde bringen hem at on
So wys and rype wordes hadde sche 
And Iuggements of so gret equite
þat sche from heuen sent was as men wende
þe poeple to plese and euery wrong to amende
 Nat long tyme after þat þis Grisilde
Was wedded sche a douȝter haþ ybore
Al hadde hir leuer haue born a knaue childe
Glad was þis marquys and his folk þerfore
ffor þough a mayden childe come al bifore
Sche may vnto a knaue child atteyne
Be lykened siþþe sche is not bareyne
Ther felle as it bifalleþ tymes mo
When þat þis childe had souked but a þrowe
This marquys in his herte longeþ so
To tempte his wyf hir sadnesse for to knowe
þat he ne might out of his herte þrowe
 This merueylous desir his wijf to assaye
Needeles god wot he þought hir to affraye
he hadde assayed hire ynough bifore
And fond hir euer good what needed it
hire for to tempte and alway more and more
But as for me I seye þat euele it sitte
þough some men it preyse for a subtil witte
To assaye a wijf whan þat it is no neede
And putten hire in anguissche and in dreede
  
 ffor which þis marquys wrought in þis manere
he com a night allone þer as sche lay
Wiþ sterne fate and wiþ trouble cheere
And seyde þus Grisilde quod he þat day
þat I ȝou took out of ȝoure pore aray
And putte ȝou in astat of heye noblesse
ȝe haue nouȝt forgeten as I gesse
 I seye Grisilde þis present dignite
In which I haue putte ȝow as I trowe  
makeþ ȝou nouȝt forȝeteful for to be
þat I ȝou took in pouer astate ful lowe
ffor eny wele ȝe mote ȝoure selue knowe
Tak heed of euery word þat I ȝou say
þer nys no wight þat heereþ it but we tway
 ȝe wote ȝoure selue wel how þat ȝe come here
In to þis hous þat nys nat longe ago
And þough to me ȝe be right leeue and deere
vnto my gentiles ȝe ben noþing so
þey say to hem it is gret schame and wo
ffor to be sogette and ben in seruage
To þe þat art born of a smal vilage
 And namely siþþe þy douȝter was ybore
This wordes han þey spoke douteles
But I desire as I haue don byfore
To lyue my lyf wiþ hem in reste and pees
I may not in þis cas be recheles
I mot do wiþ þi douȝter for þe beste
Nouȝt as I wolde but as my gentils leste
 And ȝit god wot þis is ful loþ to me
But naþeles wiþouten ȝour wetynge
I wil nat do but þis wil I quod he
That ȝe to me assent as in þis þinge
  
Schewe now ȝour pacience as in werkynge
þat ȝe me hight and swor in ȝour village
That day þat maked was our mariage
 Whan sche had herd al þis sche nat ameued
Noyþer in word ne cheere ne contynance
ffor as it semed sche was nat agreued
Sche sayde lord al liþ in ȝour plesaunce
My childe and I wiþ hertely obeissance
ben ȝoures al and ȝe mowe saue and spille
ȝoure owne þing workiþ after ȝour wille
 Ther may no þing so god my soule saue
liken to ȝou þat may displesen me
Ne I desyre noþing for to haue  
Ne drede for to lese saue oonly þe
þis wille is in myn herte and ay schal be
No lengþe of tyme or deþ may þis deface
Ne chaunge my corrage to anoþer place
 Glad was þis marquys for hire answeryng
But ȝit he feigned as it were not so
Al dreery was his cheer as his lokyng
Whan þat he schulde out of þe chambre go
Sone after þis a forlong way or tuo
he priuely haþ tolde al his entente
vnto a man and to his wijf him sente
 A maner sergeant was þis priue man
The which he feiþful often founden hadde
In þinges gret and eek such folk wel can
Don execucion of þinges badde
The lord knew wel þat he him loued and dradde
And whan þis sergaunt knew his lordes wille
In to þe chambur he stalked him ful stille
  
 Ma dame he sayde ȝe moote forȝiue it me
Though I do þing þe which I am constreyned
ȝe ben so wys þat ful wel knowe ȝe
þat lordes heestes mowe not be feyned
þey mowe wel be weyled or compleyned
But men moot needes to here lust obeye
And so wol I þer nys nomore to seye
 þis child am I comaunded for to take
And spak no more but out þe childe he hente
Dispitously and gan a cheere make
As þough he wold han slayn it or he wente
Grisildes mot al soffre and consente
And as a lombe sche sitteþ meke and stille
And lete þis cruel sergant han his wille
 Suspeccious was þe defame of þis man
Suspecte his face suspecte his word also
Suspecte þe tyme in which he þis bygan
Allas hir doughter þat sche loued so  
Sche wende he wolde haue slayen it right þo
But naþeles sche nouþer weep ne siked
Conformyng hire to þat þe marquys liked
 But atte laste speke sche bigan
And mekely sche to þe sergaunt preyed
So as he was a worþy gentil man
þat sche moste kisse hir childe or þat it deyde
And in hir barm þis litel child sche leyde
Wiþ ful sadde face and gan þis childe to blisse
And lulled it and after gan it kisse
 And þus sche seyde in hire benigne vois
ffar wel my child I schal þe neuer se
But siþ I haue þe marked wiþ þe croys
Of þilke fader blessed mote þou be
  
þat for vs deyed vpon a crosse of tre
þy soule litel child I him bytake
ffor þis night schalt þou deye for my sake
 I trowe to a norice in þis cas
It hadde ben hard þis reuþe for to se
Wel might a mooder þan han cryed allas
But naþeles so sadde stedefast was sche
þat sche endured alle aduersite
And to þe sergeaunt mekely sche sayde
haue her aȝein ȝour litel ȝonge mayde
 Goþ now quod sche and doþ my lordes heste
But o þing wold I pray ȝou of ȝour grace
þat but my lord forbad ȝou atte leste
Burieþ þis litel body in som place
þat bestes ne no briddes it torace
But he ne wolde no word to þe purpos seye
But tok þe childe and went vpon his weye
 þis sergaunt cam vnto þis lord ageyne
And of Grisildes wordes and hir cheere
he tolde him word for word in schort and pleyne
And him presenteþ with his douȝter dere
Somwhat þis lord hadde reuþe in his manere  
But naþeles his purpos held he stille
As lordes don whan þay wol haue here wille
And bad þis sergaunt þat he priuyly
Schulde þis child ful ofte wynde and wrappe
Wiþ alle circumstaunces tendrely
And carye it in a coffre or in a lappe
But vpon peyne his heed of for to swappe
þat noman schulde knowe of his entent
Ne when he come ne whider þat he went
  
 But at Boloigne it to his suster deere
That ilke time of Panyke was Countesse 
he schulde it take and schewe hir þis mateere 
Besekyng hire to don hire besynesse
This child to fostre in alle gentilnesse
And whos child þat it was he bad hire hyde
ffrom euery wight for ought þat may betyde
 þis sergaunt goþ and haþ fulfild þis þing
But now to þis markys retorne we
ffor now goþ he ful ofte ymagynyng
If by his wyffes cheer he mighte se
Or by hire word apparceyue þat sche
Were chaunged but he neuer coude hir fynde
But euer in oon ylike sad and kynde
 As glad as besy as humble in seruice
And eek in loue as sche was wont to be
Was sche to him in euery maner wyse
Ne of hir doughter nought a word spak sche
Accident for non aduersite
Was seyn in hire ne neuer hir douȝter name
Ne nempned sche in ernest ne in game
IN þis astat þer ben passed iiij ȝer
sche wiþ childe was but as god wolde
A knaue childe sche bar by þis walter
fful gracious and fair for to biholde
And whan þat folk it to his fader tolde
Nat onlich he but al þe contre merye  
Was for þis child and god þey þank and herye
 Whan it was tuo ȝeer old and fro be breste
Departed of his norice on a day
This marquys caughte ȝit anoþer leste
  
To tempte his wijf ȝit ofter if he may
O nedeles was sche tempted in assay
But wedded men knowen no mesure
Whan þat þay fynde a pacient creature
 Wijf quod þis marquys ȝe han herd of þis
My poeple sekerly bereþ heuy of oure mariage
And namely siþþe my sone boren is
Now is it wers þan euer in al oure age
The murmur sleþ myn herte and my corage
ffor to myn eeres comeþ þe voys so smerte
That it wel neih destroyed haþ myn herte
 Now sey þey þus whan walter is agon
þanne schal þe blood of Ianicle succede
And ben oure lord for oþer haue we non
Suche wordes seiþ my poeple it is no drede
Wel ought I of such murmur taken heede
ffor certeinly I drede such sentence
þough þey nought pleyne speke in myn audience
 I wolde lyue in pees if þat I mighte
Wher fore I am disposed outerly
As I his suster seruede be nighte
Right so þenke I to serue him priuely
þus warne I ȝou for ȝe nouȝt sodeinly
Out of ȝour self for no wo schulde outraye
Beþ pacient and þerfore I ȝou praye
 I haue quod sche sayd þus and euer schal
I wille no þing ne nyl no þing certayne
But as ȝou liste nouȝt greueþ me al
þough þat my doughter and my sone be slayne
At ȝour comaundement þis is to sayne
I haue nouȝt had no part of children tweyne
But first siknesse and after wo and peyne    
 ȝe ben oure lord doþ wiþ ȝour owne þing
Riȝt as ȝou liste askeþ no rede at me
ffor as I lifte at home al my cloþinge
Whan I first come to ȝou right so quod sche
lefte I my wille and al my liberte
And tok ȝour cloþing wherfore I ȝou preye
Doþ ȝour plesance I wil ȝour lust obeye
 And certes if I hadde prescience
ȝoure wille to knowe or ȝe ȝour lust me tolde
I wolde it do wiþouten necligence
But now I wot ȝour lust and what ȝe wolde
Al ȝour plesaunce ferme and stable I holde
ffor wiste I þat my deþ wolde do ȝou ese
Right gladly wolde I deye ȝou to plese
 Deþ may not make no comparisoun
vnto oure loue and whan þis marquys say
þe contenaunce of his wijf he cast a doun
his eyȝen tuo and wondreþ þat sche may
In pacience suffre al þis array
And forþ he goþ wiþ drery contynaunce
But to his herte it was right gret plesance
 þis Oggel sergaunt in þe same wise
þat he hir douȝter caughte right so he
Or worse if men worse can deuyse
haþ hent hir sone þat ful was of beaute
And euer in oon so pacient was sche
That sche no cheere made of heuynesse
But kiste hir sone and after gan it blesse
 Saue þis sche preyed him if þat he mighte
hir litel sone he wolde in erþe graue
his tendre lymes delicat to sight
ffro foules and fro bestes for to saue
  
but sche non answer of him mighte haue
he wente his wey as he no þing ne roughte
But to Boloigne he tendrely it brouȝte
 This marquys wondreþ euer lenger þe more  
vpon hir pacience and if þat he
Ne hadde soþly knowe þer bifore
þat parfitly hir children loued sche
he wolde haue wende þat of som subtilte
And of malice or for cruel corrage
That sche hadde suffred þis wiþ sad visage
 But wel he knewe next himself certayne
Sche loued hir children best in euery wise 
But now of wommen wolde I aske fayne
If þise assayes mighte nouȝt suffise 
What couþe a stordy housbonde more deuyse
To proeue his wijf and hire stedfastnesse
And he contynuyng euer in sturdynesse
 But þer ben folk of such condicion
That whan þey haue a certein purpos take
They can nought stynte of here entencion
But right as þey were bounden to a stake
þey wil nat of þat firste purpos slake 
Right so þis marquys fully haþ purposed
To tempte his wijf as he was first disposed
 he wayteþ if by word or contynance
That sche to him was chaunged of corage
But neuer coude he fynde variance
Sche was ay oon in hert and in visage
And ay þe furþer þat sche was in age
þe more trewe if þat it were possible
Sche was to him more lowe and more pesible
  
 ffor which it semed þus þat of hem tuo
þer nas but oo wille for as walter liste
That same lust was hire plesance also
And god he þanked al fel for þe beste
Sche schewed weel for no worldly vnreste
A wijf as of hir self no þing ne scholde
Wille in effecte but as hir housbond wolde
þe sclaundre of walter ofte and wyde spradde
That of a cruel herte he wikkedly  
ffor he a pore womman wedded hadde
haþ murdred boþe his children priuely
Such murmur was among hem comunly
No wonder is for to þe poeples eere
Ther com no word but þat þay mordred were
ffor which þer as his poeple þer bifore
hadde loued him wel þe sclaunder of his diffame
Made hem þat þey him hatede þerfore
To ben a murdrer is an hateful name
But naþeles for ernest ne for game
he of his cruel purpos nolde stente
To tempte his wijf was sette al his entente
 Whan þat his douȝter twelf ȝer was of age
he to þe court of Rome in subtil wise
Enformed of his wille and sente his message
Comaundyng hem suche bulles to deuyse
In þis maner and in þis same gyse
how þat þe pope as for his poeples reste
Bad him to wedde anoþer if him leste
 I say he bad þay scholden countrefete
The popes bulles making mencion
þat he haþ leue his firste wijf to lete
As by þe popes dispensacion
  
To stynte rancour and discencion
Bitwixe his poeple and him þus spak þe bulle
þe which þey han publisshed atte fulle
 The rude poeple as it no wonder is
Wenden ful wel þat it hadde be riȝt so
But whan þis tyþinges come to Grisildis
I deme þat hir herte was ful wo
And sche ylike sad for euermo
Disposed was þis humble creature
To aduersite of fortune al tendure
 Abydyng euer his lust and his plesance
To whom sche was ȝiuen herte and al
As to hire worldly verray suffisaunce  
But schortly if þis story telle I schal
This marquys writen haþ in special
A lettre in which he scheweþ his entente
And secretly he to boloigne it sente
 To þe erl of Panyke which þat hadde þo
Wedded his suster preyed he specially
To bringen home aȝein his children tuo
But he o þinge preyed outrely
With alle his herte ful affectuously
þat he to no wight þough men wolde enquere
Schulde nought telle whos children þat þei were
 But seye þe mayden schulde ywedded be
Vnto þe marquys of Saluce right anon
And as þis erle was preyed right so dede he
ffor at day sette he on his day is goon
Toward Saluce and lordes many oon
In riche array þis mayden for to gyde
hire ȝonge broþer ryding by hir syde
  
Arrayed was toward hir mariage
This freisshe mayde ful of gemmes cleere
hir broþer which þat vij ȝeer was of age
Arrayed eek ful freissch in his manere
And þus in gret noblesse and wiþ glad cheere
Toward Saluces schapynge hire iourneye
ffro day to day þey ryden in here weye
AMong al þis after his wicked vsage
þis marquys ȝit his wijf gan tempte more
To þe outrest proef of hire corage
ffully to han experiment and lore
If þat sche was as stidefast as bifore
he on a day in open audience
fful boustously haþ seid hir þis sentence
Certes Grisildis I hadde ynough plesaunce
To han ȝou to my wijf for ȝour goodnesse
As for ȝour trouþe and ȝour obeissance
Nat for ȝour lignage ne for ȝour richesse  
But now quod he in verray soþfastnesse
þat in gret lorschipe if I wol auyse
þer is gret seruytute in sondry wise
 I may not do as euery ploughman may
My poeple me constreyneþ for to take
anoþer wijf and cryen day by day
And eek þe pope rancour for to slake
Consenteþ it þat dar I vndertake
And trewelich þus meche I wil ȝou seye
My newe wijf is comynge by þe weye
 Be strong of herte and voyde anon hire place
And þilke doware þat ȝe broughten me
Tak it aȝein and graunte it of my grace
  
Retorneþ to ȝour fadres hous quod he
No man may alwey haue prosperite
Wiþ euene herte I rede ȝou tendure
þe strok of fortune or of auenture
 And sche aȝein answerde in pacience
My lord seyde sche I wot and wiste alway
how þat bitwixe ȝoure magnificence
And my pouerte no wight can ne may
maken comparison it is no nay
I helde me neuer digne in no manere
To be ȝour wijf ne ȝit ȝour chamberere
And in þis hous þer ȝe me lady made
 þe hihe god take I for my witnesse
And also wisly he my soule glade
I neuer heelde me lady ne maystresse
But humble seruaunt to ȝour worþinesse
And euere schal whil þat my lijff may dure
Abouen euery worldly creature
 That ȝe so longe of ȝoure benignite
han holde me in honour and nobleye
Wher as I was nouȝt worþy for to be
þat þanke I god and ȝow whom I preye
fforȝelde it ȝow þer nys no more to seye  
vnto my fader gladly wol I wende
And wiþ him dwelle vnto my lyues ende
 Ther I was fostred of a child ful smal
Til I be dede my lijf þer wil I lede
A wydewe clene in body herte and al
ffor siþþe I ȝaf to ȝow my maydenhede
And am ȝour trewe wijf it is no drede
God schilde such a lordes wijf to take
Anoþer man to housbonde or to make
  
 And of ȝoure newe wyf god of his grace
So graunte ȝou wele and heigh prosperite
ffor I wille gladly ȝelden hire my place
In which I was blisful wont to be
ffor siþþe it likeþ ȝow my lord quod sche
That whilom weren al myn hertes reste
þat I schal go I wol go whan ȝou leste
 But þer as ȝe me profre swich dowayre
Ay I first brought it is wel in my mynde
It were my wrecched cloþes no þing fayre
The whiche to me were now ful hard to fynde
O goode god how gentil and how kynde
ȝe semede by ȝour speche and ȝour visage
þe day þat maked was our mariage
But soþ is seyde algate I fynde it trewe
ffor in effecte it preuede is on me
loue is nat olde as whan þat it is newe
But certes lord for non aduersite
To deyen in þe cas it schal not be
þat euer in word or werk I schal repente
þat I ȝou ȝaf myn herte in hol entente
 My lord ȝe wot þat in my fadres place
ȝe dede me strepe out of my pore wede
And richely me cladden of ȝour grace
To ȝou brought I nouȝt elles out of drede
But feiþ and nakednesse and maydenhede
And here aȝein ȝour cloþing I restore  
And eek ȝour weddyng ryng for euermore
 The remenaunt of ȝoure Iewellis redy be
Wiþinne ȝour chambre dar I sauely sayn
Naked out of my fadres hous quod sche
I cam and naked I mot agayn
  
Al ȝoure plesaunce wolde I folwe fayn
But ȝit I hope it be nat ȝoure entente
That smokles out of ȝoure paleys I wente
 ȝe coude nouȝt do so dishoneste a þing
That þilke wombe in which ȝour children leye
Schulde bifore þe poeple in my walkyng
Be seyn al bare wher fore I ȝou preye 
lat me not lik a worme go by þe weye
Remembre ȝou myn owne lord so deere
I was ȝoure wijf þough I vnworþy were
Wherfore in guerdon of my maydenhede
Which þat I brought and not awey I bere
As voucheþ sauf to ȝif me to my mede
But such a smok as I was wont to were
þat I þer wiþ may wrye þe wombe of here
þat was ȝour wijf and here take I my leue
Of ȝou myn owen lord lest I ȝou greue
 The smok quod he þat þou hast on þi bak
lat it be stille and bere it forþ wiþ þe
But vnneþes þilke word he spak
But wente his wey for rewþe and pite
Biforn þe folk hir seluen strepeþ sche
And in hire smok wiþ heued and foot al bare
Toward hir fader hous is sche fare
The folk hir folwen wepyng in hire weye
And fortune ay þey cursen as þey gon
But sche fro weepyng kepte hire eyhen dreye
Ne in þis tyme word ne spak sche noon
hire fader þat þis tydinge herde anon
Curseþ þe day and tyme þat nature
Schope him to be a lyues creature    
 ffor out of doute þis olde pouere man
þat whan þe lord had fulfilde his corage
ffor euer it demed siþ it ferst bigan
him wolde þinke it were disparage
To wedde oon of so pore a lynage
To his astat so lowe to alighte
And voyde hire as sone as euer he mighte
 Aȝein his doughter hastely goþ he
ffor he by noyse of folk knew hire comyng
And wiþ hire olde cote as it mighte be
he couered hire ful sorwfully wepynge
But on hir body might he it not bringe
ffor rude was þe cloþ and more of age
By fele dayes þan was hire mariage
Thus wiþ hir fader for a certein space
Dwelleþ þis flour of wyfly pacience
þat neyþer by hir wordes ne hir face
Biforn þe folk ne eek in here absence 
Ne schewede sche þat hire was don offence
Ne of hire heih astat þe remembrance
Ne hadde sche as by hire contynaunce
No wonder is for in hire gret astate
hire gost was euer in plein humilite
No tendre mouþ non herte delicate
No pompe ne semblant of realte
But ful of pacience and benignite
Discrete and prydeles ay honorable
And to hir housbonde euer meeke and stable
 Men speke of Iob and most for his humblesse
As clerkes whan hem liste can endite
Namly of men but as in soþfastnesse
þough clerkes preyse wommen but a lite
  
þer can no man in humblesse him aquite
As wommen can ne can be half so trewe
As wommen ben but it be falle of newe
 ffro Boloigne is þis erl of Panyke come   
Of which þe fame vp sprong to more and lesse 
And to þe poeples eres alle and some 
Was couþ eek þat a newe marquysesse

That neuer was þer seyn wiþ mannes eye
So noble array in al west lumbardye
 The marquys which þat schope and knew al þis
Or þat þis erl were come sent his message
ffor þilke sely pore Grisildis
And sche with humble herte and glad visage
nouȝt wiþ no swollen herte in hire corage
Cam at his heste and on hir knees hir sette
And reuerently and wysly sche him grette
 Grisildis quod he my wille is vtterly
þis mayden þat schal be wedded to me
Receyued be to morn als really
As possible is in myn hous for to be
And eke þat euery wight in his degre

And heih plesaunce as I can best deuyse
 I haue no womman sufficaunt certayn

After my lust and þerfore wolde I fayn
Thyn were al such maner gouernance
þou knowest eek of olde al my plesaunce
þough þin array be badde and yuel beseye
Do þou þi deuer atte leste weye
  
 Nat oonly lord þat I am glad quod sche
To do ȝoure lust but I desire also
ȝou for to serue and plese in my degre
Wiþouten feynyng and schal eueremo
Ne neuer for no wele ne no woo
Ne schal þe goost wiþinne myn herte stente
To loue ȝou best wiþ al my trewe entente
 And wiþ þat word sche gan the house to dighte
And tables for to sette and beddes make  
And peyned hire to do al þat sche mighte
Preyinge þe chambereres for goddes sake
To hasten hem and faste swepe and schake
And sche þe moste seruisable of alle

 Abouten vndren gan þis erl alighte
And wiþ him brought his noble children tweye
ffor wiþ þe poeple ran to see þe sight
Of hire array so richely byseye
And þan at erst amonges hem þey seye
That walter was no fool þough þat him liste
To chaunge his wyf for it was for þe beste
 ffor sche is fairer as þey demen alle
þan is Grisilde and more tendre of age
And fairer fruyt betwen hem schulde falle
And more plesaunce for hire heih lynage
hire broþer eek so fair was of visage
That hem to se þe poeple haþ cauȝt plesaunce
Commendynge now þe marquys gouernaunce
 O stormy poeple vnsad and euer vntrewe
Ay vndiscrete and chaungyng as a fane
Delityng ay in rombile þat is newe
ffor lik þe mone ay wexen ȝe and wane
  
Ay ful of clappyng dere ynough a Iane
ȝoure dome is fals ȝour inconstance wel preueþ
A ful gret fool is he þat on ȝou leeueþ
 Thus saiden sadde folk in þat Cite
Whan þat þe peple gazed vp and doun
ffor þey were glade right for þe nouelte
To han a newe lady of oure toun
No more of þis now make I mencioun
But to Grisilde anon wil I me dresse
And telle hire constance and hire besynesse
 fful besy was Grisilde in euery þing
That to þe feste was apertenent
Right nought was sche abayssht of hire cloþing  
þough it were rude and eek somdel torent
But with glad chere to þe gate is went
With oþer folk to grete þe marquysesse
And after þat doþ forþ hire besynesse
 Wiþ so glad chere his gestes sche resceyueþ
And connyngly euerich in his degre
That defaute no man apparceyueþ
But ay þey wondren what sche mighte be

And coude such honour and reuerence
And worþily þey preysen hire prudence
 In al þis mene while sche ne stente
þis mayde and eek hir broþer to comende
With alle hire herte in ful benigne entente
So wel þat no man couþe hire pris amende
But atte laste whan þise lordes wende
To sitte doun at mete he gan to calle
Grisilde as sche was besy in his halle
  
 Grisilde quod he as it were in his play
how likeþ þe my wijf and hire beaute
Right wel quod sche my lord for in good fey
A fairer sawe I neuer non þan sche
I pray to god ȝif ȝou prosperite
And so hope I þat he wil to ȝou sende
Plesaunce ynow vnto ȝour lyues ende
 O þing beseke I ȝou and warne also 
þat ȝe prike wiþ no tormentynge
þis tendre mayden as ȝe han do mo
ffor sche is fostred in hire norischinge
more tenderly and to my supposynge
Sche coude nought aduersite endure
As coude a pore fostred creature
And whan þis walter saugh hir pacience
hire glad cher and no malice at al
And he so often hadde don hire offence
And sche ay sadde and constant as a wal  
Continuyng euere hire Innocence oueral
This sturdy marquys gan hire herte dresse
To rewen on hire wyfly stedfastnesse
 This is ynough Grisilde myn quod he
Be now no more agast ne yuel apayed
I haue þy feiþ and þi benignite
As wel as euer womman was assayed
In gret astate and pouereliche arrayed
Now knowe I deere wijf þy stedfastnesse 
And hire in armes toke and gan hire kesse
 And sche for wonder took of hit no keepe
Sche þouȝte nought what þing he to hir sayde
Sche ferde as sche hadde stirte out of hir slepe
Til sche out of hir masednesse abrayde
  
Grisilde quod he god þat  for vs deyed
þou art my wyf ne non oþer I haue
Ne neuer hadde so god my soule saue
 This is þy doughter which þou hast supposed
To be my wijf þat oþer feiþfully
Schal be myn  as I haue ay purposed
þou bare him in þi body trewely
At boloygne haue I kept hem pryuyly
Tak hem aȝein for now mayst þou not seye
þat þou hast lorn non of þy children tweye
 And folk þat oþerwise han sayd of me
I warne hem wel þat I haue don þis dede
ffor no malice ne for no cruelte
But for tassaye in þe þy wommanhede
And nat to slee my children god forbede
But for to kepe hem pryuyly and stille
Til I þi purpos knewe and al þy wille
 Whan þis herde a swowne doun sche falleþ
ffor pytous ioye and after hir swownynge
Sche boþe hire ȝonge children to hire calleþ
And in his armes pitously wepynge
Embraceþ hem and tendrely kissinge  
fful like a moder wiþ hire salte teeres
Sche baþeþ boþe hire visage and hire heres
 O which a pytous sight it was to see
hir swownyng and hire humble voys to heere
Graunt mercy lord god I þanke it ȝou quod she
þat ȝe han saued me my children deere
now rekke I neuer to be ded right heere
Siþþe I stonde in ȝour loue and in ȝour grace
No fors of deþ ne whan my spirit pace
  
 O tendre o dere o ȝonge children myne
ȝour woful moder wende stedefastly
That cruel houndes or som foul vermyne
hadde eten ȝou but god of his mercy
And ȝoure benigne fader tenderly
haþ don ȝou kepte and in þe same stounde
Al sodeinly sche swapte a doun to grounde
 And in hire swowne so sadly holdeþ sche
hire children tuo whan sche gan hem enbrace
þat with gret sleighte and wiþ gret difficulte
þe children from hire arm þei gon arace
O many a teer on many a pitous face
Doun ran of hem þat stooden hire besyde

Walter hir gladeþ and hir sorwe slakeþ
Sche ryseþ vp abaysshed from hire traunce
And euery wight hire ioye and feste makeþ
til sche haþ caught aȝein hir contenance
Walter hire doþ feiþfully plesaunce
þat it is deynte for to se þe cheere
Bitwixe hem tuo now þey ben mett in feere
 This ladyes whan þat þey here tyme saye
han taken hire and in to chambre goon
And streepen hire out of hire ruyde array
And in a cloþ of gold þat brighte schoon
Wiþ a coroune of many a riche stoon
vppon hire heed þey in to halle hir broughte  
And þan sche was honoured as sche oughte
 Thus haþ þis pitous day a blisful ende
ffor euery man and womman doþ here might
This day in mirþe and reuel to dispende
Til on þe welken schone þe sterres bright
  
ffor more solempne in euery mannes sight
þis feste was and gretter of costage
Than was þe reuel of hire mariage
 fful many a ȝeer in hih prosperite
lyuen þise tuo in concord and in reste
And richely his douȝter maryed he
vnto a lord on of þe worþieste
Of alle ytayle þanne and pes and reste
his wyues fader in his court he kepeþ
Til þat his soule out of his body creepeþ
 his sone succediþ in his heritage
In reste and pees after his fader day
And fortunat eek was in mariage
Al putte he not his wijf in gret assay
This world is not so strong it is no nay
As it haþ ben in olde tyme ȝore
And herkneþ what þis auctor seiþ þerfore
This story is sayd not for þat wyues scholde
ffolwen grisilde as in humilite
ffor it were importable þough þey wolde
But for þat euery wight in his degre
Schulde be constante in aduersite
As was Grisilde þerfore Petrayke writeþ
þis story which he wiþ his stile enditeþ
ffor siþþe a womman was so paciente
vnto a mortel man wel more vs ouȝte
Resceyuen al in gree þat god vs sente
ffor grete skiles he preeueþ þat he wrouȝte
But he ne tempteþ no man þat he brouȝte
As seiþ seint Iame ȝif ȝe his pistil rede
He preueþ folk alday it is no drede    
And suffreþ vs as for oure excercise
Wiþ scharpe scorges of aduersite
fful often to ben betyn in sondry wyse
Nought for to knowe oure wille for certes he
Or we were born knew al oure frelete
And for oure beste is al oure gouernance
lat vs þanne lyue in vertuous suffraunce
 But lordinges o word herkeneþ ar I go
It were ful hard to fynde now a dayes
In alle a toun Grisildes þre or tuo
ffor if þat þey were putte to suche assayes
The golde of hem haþ now so badde layes
Wiþ bras þat þough þe coyne be fayr at eye
It wolde raþer berst a tuo þan plye
 ffor which here for þe wyues loue of Baþe
Whos lijf and al hire helþe god mayntene
In hire maystrye and elles were it skaþe
I wolde wiþ lusty herte freisshe and grene
Sey ȝou a song to glade ȝou I wene
And late vs stynte of ernestful matiere
herkneþ my song þat seiþ in þis manere
 Grisild is deed and eek hir pacience
And boþe at oones buryed in ytayle
Wher fore I crye in open audience
No wedded man be hardy to assayle 
his wyues pacience in hope to fynde 
Grisildis for in certes he schal fayle 
  
O noble wyues ful of heih prudence
lat non humilite ȝoure tonge nayle 
Ne lat no clerk haue cause or diligence
To write of ȝou a story of such meruayle
As Grisildis pacient and kynde
lest chychevache ȝow swolwe in hire entrayle
ffolweþ herto and holdeþ no scilence

beth nat bidaffid  for youre innocence
but sharply take on yow  the gouernaille
enpoynteth wel this lessoun  in youre mynde
for comune profit  sith hit may availle
And ye Archiwivis  stondith at defence
syn ye be stronge  as is a grete Camaille
ne suffrith not  that men do yow offence
and slender wivis  as feble in bataille
beith egre as a Tigre  biyende the se fer in ynde
ay clappith as a mylle  I yow consaille
Ne dredith hem nought doith hem no reuerence
for though thyn housbond armed be  in maille
the wordis of thi crabbed eloquence
shal persshe his breste  and eke his auentaille
in gelousie I rede eke  thow him bynde
and thow shalt make him covche  as a quaille
Yf thow be feyre  there folk ben in presence
shewe thow thi visage  and thin apparaille
yf thow be foule  be fre of thi dispence
to gete the frendis  ay do thi travaille
be euer of chere as light  as leff on lynde
and lete him care · wepe  wrynge and waille
Whilom ther was dwellyng  in Lumbardye
a worthi knyght  that borne was in Pavie
in which he lived  in grete prosperite
and sexti yere  a wiffles man was he
and folwed ay  his bodyly delite
on women  there as was his appetite
as don these foolis  that ben seculere
and whan he was passed sexti yere
were hit for holynes  or for dotage
I can not sey  but suche a grete corage
had this knyght  to be a wedded man
that day and night  he doth al that he can
to espien where he myghte  wedded be
prayng oure lord  graunte him that he
myghte onys knowe  of that blisful liff
that is bitwixe an housbonde  and his wiff
and for to live  vnder that holy bonde
with which first  god man and woman bonde
noon other liff seide he  is worthe a bene
for wedlok is so esy  and so clene
that in this world  hit is a paradise
thus seide this olde knyght  that was so wise
and certeynly  as soth as god is kynge
to take a wiff  hit is a glorious thinge
and namely whan a man is olde  and hore
than is a wiff the fructe  of his tresore
than shulde he take a yonge wiff  and a feyre  
on which he myghte  engender him an heyre
  
and lede his liff in ioye  and in solas
where that these bachelers  synge alas
whan that thei fynden  any aduersite
in love  which nys but childis vanyte
and trewely hit sit wel  to be so
that bachelers han ofte peyne and wo
on brotil gronde thei bilde  and brotilnes
they fynden  whan thei wenyn sikernes
thei live but as a brid  or as a beste
in liberte  and vnder noon areste
there as a wedded man  in his estate
livith a liff blisful  and ordynate
vnder the yoke of mariage Ibounde
wel may his herte  in ioye and blis habounde
for who can be so boxom  as a wiff
who is so trewe  and eke so ententiff
to kepe him sike and hole  as his make
for wel or wo  she wol him not forsake
she is not wery  him to loue and serue
though that he lye bedred  til he sterve
And ȝit some clerkes seyn it nys nouȝt so  
Of which Theoffraste  is on of þo
What fors þeiȝ theofraste luste lye
Ne take no wijf quod he for husbandrye
As for to spare in housholde þin dispence
A trewe seruaunt doþ more diligence
þy good to kepe þan þin owen wijf
ffor sche wol clayme half part al hire lijf
And if þat þou be seek so god me saue
þy verray frendes oþer a trewe knaue
Wol kepe þe bet þan sche þat wayteþ ay
After þy good and haþ don many a day

fful lightly maist thow be a Cokewoolde
To þis entente and an C siþes wurse
  
But tak no kepe of alle such vanyte
Defye theofrast and herkne me
A wyff is goddes ȝifte verrayly
Alle oþer maner ȝiftes hardily
As landes rentes pasture or comune
Oþer oþer ȝiftes þat moebles of fortune
þat passen as a schadewe on a wall
But drede nought if pleynly speke I schall
A wyf wil laste and in þin hous endure
Wel lenger þan þe luste to endure
mariage is a ful gret sacrament
he which haþ no wijf I holde him schent
he lyueþ helples and is al desolat
I speke of folk in seculer estat
And herkne why I say nouȝt þis for nouȝt
þe womman is for mannes help ywrouȝt
þe hihe god when he hadde adam maked
And sawe him allone bely naked
God of his grete goodnesse sayde he þanne
lete vs now make an helpe to þis manne
ylike to himself and þen he made Eue
here may ȝe se and hereby ȝe preue
That wijf is mannes helpe and his comfort
his paradis terreste and his disport  
So buxom and so vertuous is sche
þey mosten needes lyue in vnite
Of fleisshe þei ben and O fleisch as I gesse
nouȝt but on herte in wele and in distresse
A wyf A seinte mary benedicite
how might a man han any aduersite
þat haþ a wyf certes I can nouȝt say
þe blisse þat is bitwexe hem tway
þer may no tonge telle or herte þynke
If he be pore sche helpeþ him to swynke
Sche keepiþ his good and wasteþ neuer a del
And al þat hire housband lust hir likeþ wel
  
Sche saiþ nouȝt ones nay whan he saiþ ȝe
Do þis saiþ he al redy sire seyþ sche
O blisful ordre O wedlok precious
þou art so mery and eek so vertuous
And so comended and aproued eke
That euery man þat halt him worþ a leek
vpon his bare knees aught al his lijf
þanken his god þat him haþ sent a wyf
Oþer preyed god him for to sende
A wijf to laste vnto his lyues ende
ffor þanne his lijf is sett in sikernesse
he may nouȝt be desceyued as I gesse
So þat he werche after his wyues reed
þanne may he boldely beren vp his heed
þey ben so trewe and so wys
ffor which if þou wolt worchen as þe wyse
Do alway so as þe womman wol þe rede
lo how þat Iacob as þise clerkes rede
By good counseil of his moder rebekke
Band þe kydes skyn abouten his nekke
ffor which his fadres benyson he wan
lo Iudith as þe story eek telle can
By wys counseil sche goddes poeple kepte
And slough him Olophinus whiles he slepte  
Lo how Abygayle by good counseil how þat sche
Saued hire housbonde Nabal whan þat he
Schulde han be slayn and loke after also
By good counseil delyuered out of wo
The poeple of god and made him mardoche
Of Assuer enhaunced for to be
Ther is no þing gree superlatiff
As seiþ Senek aboue an humble wyf
Suffre þyn wyues tonge as Catoun byt
Sche schal comaunde and þou schalt suffre yt
And ȝit sche wolde obeye of curtesye
A wyf is kepere of þin housbondrye
  
Wel may þe seeke man bewayle and wepe 
Ther as þer nys no wijf þe hous to keepe
I warne þe if wysly þou wilt wirche
loue wel þy wyf as crist loueþ his chirche
If þou loue þy self þou louest þy wyf
No man hateþ his flesch but in his lyf

Cherissche þy wijf or þou schalt neuer þe

Of worldly folk holde þe righte weye

And namely vpon þe wyues syde

Considereþ haþ in wiþ his dayes olde

And for his frendes on a day sent
To telle hem þeffect of his entent
Wiþ face sadde he haþ hem þis tale tolde

And almost god wot at my pittis brinke
vpon my sowle somwhat most I þinke
I haue my body folyly dispended
yblessed be god þat it schal ben amended  
ffor I wol be certein a wedded man
And þat in alle þe haste þat I can
vnto som mayde fayr and tendre of age
I pray you schapeþ for my mariage
Al sodeinly for I wol nouȝt abyde
And I wole fonde aspye on my syde
To whom I may be wedded hastely
But for as moche þat ȝe ben mo þen I

But o þing warne I ȝou my frendes deere
I wol non old wyf haue in no manere 
  
She schal nouȝt passe xvj ȝer certayn
Old fleissh and ȝong fleissh þat wolde I han ful fayn
Bet is quod he a pyk þan a pykrelle
And bet þan olde beef is þe tendre feelle

It nys but benestraw and gret forage
And eek þis olde wydewes god it woot
þey konne so moche craft on wades boot
So mochil broken harme whan þat hem liste
þat wiþ hem schulde I neuer lyuen in reste
ffor sondry scoles makeþ subtile clerkys
Wommen of many a scole half a clerk is
But certeinly a ȝong þing may me gye
Right as men may warm wax wiþ handes toplye
þerfore I sey ȝow pleinly in a clause
I wol non old wijf haue for þis cause
ffor if so were if I hadde so myschaunce
That I in hire ne couþe han · no plesaunce
þenne scholde I lede my lijf in aduoutrye
And so streyt to þe deuyl whan I dye
Ne children schulde I non vpon hire geten
ȝit were me leuer houndes hadde me eten
þan þat myn heritage scholde falle
In straunge hande and þus I telle ȝou alle  
I dowte nought I wot þe cause why
men schulde wedde and forþermore wot I
þer spekeþ many men of mariage
þat wot nomore of hit þen wot my page
ffor whiche causes men schulde take a wyf
If he may not chaste be by his lijf
Tak him a wijf wiþ gret deuocioun
By cause of leofful procreacion
Of children to þe honour of god aboue
And nought only for paramour and for loue
And for þei schulden leccherie eschue
And ȝelde here dette whil þat it is newe
  
Or for þat ilke man schulde helpe oþer
In meschief as a soster schal do a broþer
And lyue in chastite ful heuenly
But sires by ȝour leue þat am not I
ffor  be þanked I dar make auaunt
I feele my lemes starke and suffisaunt
To don al þat a man bilongeþ to do

þough I be hoor and fare  as doþ a tree

A blossemed tree nys neyþer druye ne deed
I feele me no wher hoor but on myn heed
Myn herte and myn lymes ben as greene
As laurere þat purgh þe ȝer is seene
And seþenes ȝe han herd al myn entent
I pray ȝou to my wille þat ȝe assent
Dyuerse men dyuersely him tolde
Of mariages many ensamples olde
Some blamed it some preysed it certein
But atte laste schortly for to seyn
As alday falleþ altercacion

Of which þat on was cleped Placebo  
Placebo seyde o Ianuare broþer
To ȝou telle I þis tale and to non oþer
fful litel need hadde ȝe my lord so deere 
Counseil to aske of any þat is heere
But þat ȝe be on so ful of sapience

To weyue fro þe word of Salomon

And þanne schalt þou nouȝt repente þe

So wisly god my soule bringe at reste

And trewely it is an heih corage
Of eny man þat stopen is in age
To take a ȝong wyf by my fader kyn

And seþenes I aught auyse me right wel
To whom I ȝiue my good awey fro me
Wel more I auȝte to auȝse me
To whom I ȝiue my body for alwey
I warne ȝou wel it nys no childes pley
To take a wijf wiþoute auysement
Men moste enquere þis is myn assent
Wheþer she be wys or sobre or drunkelewe
Oþer proude oþer oþerwey a schrewe
A chydester or a wastour of þy good
Oþir riche or pore or of maneres wood
Al be it so þat no man fynde schal

And wiþ þat word þay rysen sodeinly

þer passeþ þorgh his herte night be night
As whos took a myrour polisshed bright
And sette it in a comune market place
þenne scholde he se many a figure pace  
By his myrour and in þe same wise
Gan Ianuare in wiþ his þouȝt deuyse
Of maydenes whiche þat dwelte besyde
he wiste nought wher he might abyde
ffor þouȝ þat oon haþ beaute in hire face 
Anoþer stant so in þe poeples grace 
ffor hire sadnes and hire benignite
þat of þe poeple grettest voys hadde sche
And some were riche and hadde badde name
but naþeles bitwixe ernest and game
he atte laste appoynted him on oon
And leet alle oþer fro his herte gon
  
And ches hir of his owen auctorite
ffor loue is blynd alday and may not se
And whan þat he was in þe bed ybrought
he purtreyed in his herte and in his þought
hire freisshe beaute  and hir age tender
hire myddel smal and hir armes long and sklender
hire wise gouernaunce and hire grete gentilnes
hir wommanly berynge and hire sadnes
And whan þat he was fro hire condescended
him þouȝte his þouȝt might nouȝt ben amended
ffor whan þat he himself concluded hadde
him þouȝt euer oþer mannes witte so badde
þat inpossible it were to replye
aȝein his choys þis was his fantasye
his frendes sent he to at his instance
And preyed hem to don him þat plesaunce
þat hastely þey wolden don him come 
he wolde abregge here labour alle and some
Needeþ nomore for him to goon or ryde
he was apoynted þer he wolde abyde
Placebo cam and eek his freendes sone
And alþer first he bad hem alle a bone
þat non of hem non argumentes make
Aȝeins þe purpos which þat he haþ take  
Which purpos was plesaunt to god sayde he
And verray ground of his prosperite
he sayde þer was a mayden in þe toun
Which þat of beaute hadde gret renoun
Al were it so sche were of smal degre
Sufficeþ him hire ȝouþe and hire beaute
Which mayde he seyde schulde ben his wiff
To lede in ese and holynesse his lijf
And þanked god þat he might han hire al
þat no wight wiþ his blisse parten schal
And preyed hem to laboure in þis neede 
And schaped þat he fayled not to spede
  
ffor þanne he seyde his spirit was at eese
þen is quod he no þing may me displese 
Saue o þing prikeþ in my conscience
þe which I wol reherse in ȝoure presence 
I haue quod he herd seyd ful ȝore ago
þer may no man han parfyt blisses tuo
þis is to say in erþe and eek in heuene
ffor þey he kepte him fro þe synnes seuene
And eek for euery braunche of þilke tre
ȝit is þer so parfit prosperite
And so gret ese and lust in mariage
þat euer I am agast now in myn age
þat I schal lede now so mery a lijf

that I shal haue myn heuen  in erthe
ffor siþenes þat verray heuene is bought so deere
Wiþ tribulacion and gret penaunce
how scholde I lyue in such plesaunce
As alle wedded men doþ wiþ here wyues 
Come to þe blisse þer crist eterne on lyue is
þis is my drede and ȝit myn breþeren tweye
Assoylleþ me þis question I ȝou preye
Iustynus which þat hated his folye
Answeryng anon riȝt in his Iapere
And for he wolde his longe tale abregge
he wolde non auctorite alegge  
But seyde sire so þer be non obstacle
Oþer þan þis god of his heih miracle
And of his mercy may so for ȝou wirche
þat er ȝe han ȝour ȝiftes of holy chirche
ȝe may repente of wedded mannes lijf
In which ye sayn þer is neiþer woo ne strijf
And elles god forbede but if he sente
A wedded man grace to repente
Wel often raþer þan a sengil man
And þerfore sire þe beste reed I can
  
Dispeyreþ ȝou nouȝt haueþ in memory
Paraunter sche may be ȝour purgatory
Sche may be goddes mene and goddes whippe
þan schal ȝour soule vp to heuene skippe
Swifter þan doþ an arwe out of a bowe
I hope to god herafter schalt þou knowe
þat þer nys non so gret felicite
In mariage ne neuer more schal be
þat ȝou schal lakke of ȝour saluacion
So þat ȝe vse as skile is and resoun
þe lustes of ȝour wijf attemperelly
And þat ȝe plese hir nouȝt to amerously
And þat ȝe kepe ȝou eek fro oþer synne 
Myn tale is doon for my witte is þinne
Beþ nouȝt agast hereof my broþer
But let vs wade fro þis mater to anoþer
þe wijf of Bathe if ȝe han vnderstonde
Of mariage which ȝe han on honde
Declared haþ ful wel in litel space
ffareþ now wel god haue ȝou in his grace
And wiþ þis word þis Iustyne and his broþer
han take here leue and ilke of hem of oþer
ffor whan þey sawe it moste needes be
þey wrouȝten so by wys and sleigh trete
þat sche þis mayden which þat mayus hight
As hastely as euer þat sche might  
Schal wedded be vnto Ianuarie 
It trowe it were to long ȝou to tarie
If I ȝou tolde of euery scryt or band
By which þat sche was feffed in his land
Oþer for to herken of hire riche aray
But fynally ycomen is þis day
That to þe chirche boþe ben þey went
ffor to resceyue þe holy sacrament
fforþ comþ þe prest wiþ stole aboute his nekke 
And bad hire be ylike Sarra and Rebekke
  
In wisdom and trouþe of mariage
And sayde his orisouns as is his vsage
And crouched hem and bad god schulde hem blesse
And made al siker ynough with holynesse 
þus ben þey weddid with solempnite
And atte feste sitteþ he and sche
Wiþ oþer worþy folk vpon þe deys
Al ful of ioye and blisse is þe paleys
And ful of instrumentz and of vitayle
þe moste deyntevous of alle ytayle
Byforn hem of instrumentz which a soun
That Orpheus ne of Phebes ampheoun
Ne maden neuer such a melodye
And at euery cours cam lowde menstralcie
þat neuer Ioab trumped for to heere 
Neiþer Theodomas ȝit half so cleere
And Thebes whan þe cite was in doute 
Bacus þe wyn hem schenkeþ al aboute
And venus lawheþ vpon euery wight
ffor Ianuarye was bycome here knight
And wolde boþe assayen his corage
In liberte and eek in mariage
And wiþ hir fyr brond wiþ hire hand aboute
Daunsiþ byforn þe bryde al aboute
And certeynly I dar wel seyn riȝt þis
Emyneus þat god of weddyng is  
Sawe neuer in his lijf so mery a wedded man
halde þou þy pes þou poete Marcean
þat writest vs þat ilke weddyng mery
Of hire phylologie and of mercurye
And of þe sanges þat þe muses song
So smale as eek þin penne and eek þy tong
ffor to discryuen of þis mariage
When tendre ȝouþe haþ wedded stowpyng age
þer is such myrþe þat it may nouȝt be write
Assayeþ it ȝou self þen may ȝe wite 
  
If þat I lakke or non in þis matere
Mayus þat sitt wiþ so benigne a cheere
hire to beholde it semed fayerye
Queene Ester loked neuer wiþ such an yhe
On assuer so meke a look haþ sche
I may ȝou nouȝt deuyse al hire beaute
But þus moche of hir beaute telle I may
þat sche was like þe brighte morwe of may
ffulfilde of beaute and of plesaunce
þis Ianuarye is rauyssht in a traunce
And at euery tyme he loked on hire face 
But in his herte he gan hire to manace
þat he þat night in armes wolde hir streyne
harder þan euyr parys did Eleyne
But naþeles ȝit had he gret pite
þat þilke night offenden hire moste he
And þouȝt allas O tender creature
Now wolde god ȝe mighte wel endure
Al my corrage  it is so scharpe and kene
I am agast ȝe schullen it nat sustene
But god forbede þat I did al my myght
Now wolde god þat it were waxen nyght
And þat þe night wolde lasten eueremo
I wolde þat al þis poeple were a go
And finally he doþ alle his labour
As he best mighte sauynge his honour  
To hasten hem fro þe mete in subtil wise
þe tyme came þat resoun was to ryse
And after þat men daunce and drynke faste
And spices al aboute þe hous þay caste
And ful of ioye and blisse is euery man
Al but a squyer þat highte damyan
Which karf byforn þe knight many a day
he was so rauysshed on his lady may
That for þe verray peyne he was neyȝ wood
Almost he swelt and swowned þer he stood
  
As þat sche bare daunsyng in hir hand
So freisshe sche was and þerto so likand
And to his bed he went him hastily
Nomore of him at þis tyme speke I
But þere I lete him weepe ynough and pleyne
Till freissche may wil rewen on his peyne
 O perilous fyr þat in þe bedstraw brediþ
O famuler foo þat his seruise beediþ
O seruant traytour fals holy hewe
Ilike to þe neddre sleyȝ and in Bosom vntrewe
God schilde vs alle fro ȝoure iniquitance
O Ianuare drunken in plesaunce
O mariage see how þine Damyan
þin oughne squyer and þyn borne man
Entendiþ to do þe vylenye
God graunte þe þin harmly foo to aspye
ffor in þis world nys worse pestylence
Than homly foo alday in þy presence
Parfourmed haþ þis deuyn day his ark dyurne
No lenger may þe body of him soiourne
The Orisowte as in þat latitude
Night wiþ his mantel þat is so derk and rude
Gan for to sprede þe mysperye aboute
ffor which departed is þe lusty route
ffor Ianuare wiþ þank on euery syde
home to here houses lustily þei ryde   
þer as þey don here þinges as hem leste
And whanne þay seye her tyme gon to reste
Sone after þat þis hastyf Ianuare
Wol go to bedde he wol no lengere care
he drynkeþ ypocras clarre and vernage
Of spices hote to encresen his corage
And many a letuare hadde he ful fyn
Suche as þe cursed monk daun Constantyn
haþ writen in his book of coytu
To eten hem alle he nas no þing eschewe
  
And þus to his priue freendes seyde he
ffor goddes loue as sone as it may be
let voyden alle þis hous in curteys wyse soone
Men drunken and þe trauers drowe anone
The bryde was brouȝt to bedde as stille as stoon
So hastede Ianuer it moste be doon
And whan þe bed was wiþ þe prest yblessed
Out of þe chambre haþ euery wight him dressed
And Ianuare haþ faste in armes take
his freissche may his paradys his make
he lulliþ hire he kisseþ hire ful ofte
Wiþ þikke brystles of his berd vnsofte
Ylike to þe skyn of an houndfissh scharp as brere
ffor he was schaue al newe in his manere
he rubbeþ hire vpon hire tendre face
And sayde þus allas I mot trespace
To ȝou my spouse and ȝou gretly offende
Or tyme come þat I wol doun descende
But naþeles considereþ þis quod he
þis nys no werkman what so euer he be
þat may boþe wirche wel and hastely
þis wol be don at leyser parfitly
It is no force how longe þat we pleye
I trowe in wedlok coupled be we tweye
And yblessed be þe ȝok þat we ben Inne
ffor in oure actis we may do no synne   
A man may do no synne wiþ his wijf
Ne hurte himselue wiþ his owene knyf
Now we han leue to pleye vs by þe lawe
Thus laboureþ he til þat þe day gan dawe
And þenne he takeþ a soppe in fyn clarre
And vpright in his bedde þanne sitteþ he 
And after þat he sang ful lowde and cleere
And kissed his wijf and made wantoun cheere
he was al coltissch and ful of ragerie
And ful of Girgoun as is a flekked pye 
  
þe slakke skyn aboute his nekke schakeþ
Whil þat he sang so chaunteþ he and crakeþ 
But god wot what may þouȝte in hire herte 
Whan sche him saugh vp sittyng in his scherte
In his night cappe and wiþ his nekke lene 
Sche preyseþ nouȝt his pleying worþ a bene
þenne seyde he þus my restyng wol I take
Now day is come I may no lenger wake
And doun he leyd his heed and sleep til prime
And aftirward whan þat he saugh his tyme
vp ryseþ Ianuare but freissche may
holt hire chambre vnto þe ferþe day
As vsage is of wyues for þe beste 
ffor euery labour som tyme mot haue reste
Oþer elles longe may he nouȝt endure
þis is to say no lyues creature
Be it of fissh or brid or best or man
Now wol I speke of woful dauyan
þat langureþ for loue as ȝe schullen heere
þerfore I speke to him in þis manere
I say O sely Damyan allas
Answere to þis demaunde as in þis cas
how schalt þou þy lady freisshe may
Telle þy wo sche wole alway say nay
Eke if þou speke sche wole þy wo bewreye
God be þin helpe I can no bettre seye  
þis sike damyan in venus fyre
So brenneþ þat he deyeþ for desire
ffor which he putte his liff in aduenture
No lenger might he in þis wise endure
But priuyly a penner gan he borwe
And in a lettre wrot he alle his sorwe
In maner of a complaynt oþer a lay
vnto þis fair and freissche lady may
And in a purs of silk heng on his scherte
he haþ yput and leyd it at his herte
  
þe more þat at noon was þilke day
That Ianuare haþ wedded þat freissche may
In tuo of Taure was in þe Cancre Gliden
So longe haþ sche in hire chambre abyden
As costume is vnto þise noblis alle
A bryde schal nouȝt eten in þe halle
Til dayes foure oþer þre dayes atte leste
ypassed ben þen lat hire go to feste
þe ferþe day complet froo noon to noon
Whan þat þe hihe masse was ydoon
In halle sitt þis Ianuare and may
As freissh as is þe brighte someres day
And so bifelle how þat þis goode man
Remembreþ him vpon þis damyan
And sayde seinte mary how may þis be
That Damyan entendiþ nouȝt to me
Is he ay sike or how may þis betyde
his squyers whiche þat stooden him besyde
Excusynge him be cause of his seknesse
Which letted him to don his busynesse
Non oþer cause mighte make him care
That me forþinkeþ quod þis Ianuare
he is a gentil squyer by my trouþe 
If þat he deyde it were harm and rouþe
he is as wys discrete and secre
As eny man I wot of his degre  
And þerto manly and eek seruisable
And for to ben a þrifty man right able
But after mete as sone as euer I may
I wole my self visite him and eek may
To don him al þe confort þat I can
And for þat word him blessed euery man
That of his bounte and of his gentilnesse
He wolde so conforten him in his siknesse
His squyer for it was a gentil dede
Dame quod he þis Ianuar take good hede
  
That at after mete ȝe wiþ ȝour wommen alle
Whan ȝe han ben in chambre out of þis halle
That alle ȝe gon to se þis Damyan
Doþ him disport he is a gentil man
And telleþ him þat I wil him visite
haue I no þing but rested me a lite

til that ye slepe  right bi my side
Now wiþ þat worde he gan to him calle
A squyer þat was marschal of his halle
And tolde him certeyn þinges what he wolde
This freisshe may haþ streyt hir weye holde
Wiþ alle hire wommen vnto þis damyan
Doun by his beddes syde sat sche þan
Confortyng him as goodly as sche may
This damyan whan he his tyme say
In secret wise his purs and eek his bille
In which þat he writen hadde his wille
haþ putte in to hire hond wiþouten more
Saue þat he siked wonder sore
And softely to hire right þus sayde he
mercy and þat ȝe discouereþ nouȝt me
ffor I am ded if þat þis þing be kyd
This purs haþ sche wiþinne hir bosme hid
And went hir way ȝe gete nomore of me
But vnto Ianure ycomen is sche
And on his beddes syde sitte ful softe
He takeþ hire and kisseþ hire ful ofte  
And leyde him doun to slepe and þat anon
Sche feyned hire as þat sche moste gon
þer as ȝe woot þat euery wight mot neede
And when sche of þis bille haþ taken heede
Sche rent it al to cloutes at þe laste
And in þe pryue softely sche it caste
Who studieþ now but fayre freissche may
And a doun by Ianuer sche lay
  
That sleep til þat þe coughe him haþ awaked
Anon he preyed hir to strepen hire al naked
he wolde of hire he sayde of hire haue som plesaunce
he seyde hire cloþes dide him encombraunce
And sche obeyeþ be he leef or loþ
But lest þat precious folk be wiþ me wroþ
how þat he wrouȝte I dar to ȝou nouȝt telle
Oþer whether þat he þouȝt on paradys oþer of helle
But I lete hem worchen in here wise
Til euesong rynge and þat þey moste aryse 
Were it by destyne oþir by auenture
Were it by influence or by nature
Oþer in constillacion þat in such estat
The heuene stood þat tyme fortunat
Was for to putte a bille of venus werkis
ffor alle þing haþ tyme as seyn þise clerkis
To any womman for to gete hir loue
I can nouȝt say but þe grete god aboue
þat knoweþ þat non acte is causeles
he demeþ of alle for I wol holde my pes
But soþ is þis how þat þis freissche may
haþ take such impression þat day
On pite of þis sike Damyan
þat fro hir herte sche ne dryue can
þe remembrance for to don him eese
Certein þouȝt sche whom þat þis þing displese
I rekke nouȝt for here I him assure
To loue him best of eny creature   
þough he na more nadde þan his scherte
lo pite renneþ sone in gentil herte
Her may ȝe se how excellent franchise
In wommen is whan þey narwe hem auyse
Som tyrant þer is as þer ben many oon
þat haþ an herte as hard as eny stoon
Which wolde han lete him steruen in þe place
Wel raþer þan haue graunted him þat grace
  
And hem reioysen in here cruel pryde
And recched nouȝt to ben an homicide
 This gentil may fulfild of alle pite
Right so of hire hond a lettre made sche
In which sche graunteþ him of hire verray grace
þer lackeþ nouȝt oonly but day and space
Wher þat sche mighte to his lust suffise
ffor it schal be right as he wol deuyse
And whan sche saugh hire tyme vpon a day
To visite þis damyan goþ faire may
And sotilly þis lettre doun sche þriste
vnder his pilwe rede iff him liste
Sche takeþ him by þe hond and harde him twiste
So secrely þat no wight hit wiste
And bad him be al hool and forþ sche wente
To Ianuare whan þat he for hire sente
vp ryseþ Damyan þe nexte morwe
Al passed was his siknesse and his sorwe
he kembiþ him and proyneþ him and pikeþ
he doþ al þat þis lady lust and likeþ
And ek to Ianuare he goþ as lowe
As euer did a dogge for þe bowe
he is so plesaunt vnto euery man
ffor craft is al who so þat it can
þat euery wight is fayn to teche him good
And fully in his lady grace he stood
þus lete I Damyan aboute his neede
And my tale forþ I wil procede  
Some clerkes halden þat felicite
Stant in delite and þerfore he
This noble Ianuare wiþ alle his might
In honeste wise as longeþ to a knight
Schop him to lyue ful deliciously
his housynge his array al honestely
To his degre was maked as a kinges
Among oþir of his honeste þinges
  
he hadde a gardyn walled al wiþ stoon
So fair a gardyn wot I nowher noon
ffor out of doute I verrayly suppose
þat he þat wroot þe romance of þe rose
Ne couþe of it þe beaute wel deuyse
ne pryapus ne mighte nat suffise
þouȝ he be god of gardyns for to telle
The beaute of þe gardyn and of þe welle
þat stood vnder a laurer alway greene
fful often tyme king Pluto and his queene
Preserpyna and alle hire fayerie
Disporten hem and maken melodye
aboute þat welle and daunced as men tolde
þis noble knight þis Ianuare þe olde
Suche deynte haþ in it to walken and to pleye
þat he wol suffre no wight to bere þe keye
Saue he himself or of þe smale wiket
he bar alwey of siluer a clyket
Wiþ þe whiche whan þat him lust vnschette
And whan þat he wolde paye his wijf his dette
In somer seson þider wolde he go
And may his wijf and no wight but þay tuo
A þinges whiche þat were nouȝt don a bedde
þey in þe gardyn parformed han and spedde
And in þis wise many a mery day
lyuede þis Ianuare and freissche may
But worldly ioye may nouȝt alwey endure
To Ianuare ne to no worldly creature  
O sodeyn happ O þou fortune vnstable 
Ilike to þe scorpion vnstable 
That flaterest wiþ þin heed whan þou wolt stynge
Thyn tayl is deþ þoruȝ þin enuenemynge
O brutel ioye O swete poyson queynte
O mustier þat sotilly canst peynte
þine ȝiftes vnder þe hewe of stedefastnesse
þat þou disceyuedest boþe more and lesse
  
Why hast þou Ianuare þus deceyued
And haddist him for þi fulle frend receyued
And now þou hast byraft him boþe his eyen
ffor sorwe of which desireþ he to deyen
Allas þis noble Ianuare þat is so fre
Amydde his lust and his prosperite
Is woxen blynde and al sodeynly
his deþ þerfore desireþ he outrely
And þer wiþ al þe fyr of Ielousye
leste þat his wijf schulde falle in som folye
So brent his herte þat he wolde fayn
That som man boþe hire and him hadde slayn
ffor neuer  his deþ ne in his lyf
Ne wolde he þat sche were loue ne wyf
But euer lyue as a wydewe in cloþes blake
Soule as þe turtil doþ þat haþ lost hire make 
But at þe laste after a monþe or tweye
his sorwe gan to swage soþ to seye
ffor when he wiste it may non oþer be
he paciently took his aduersite
Saf out of doute may he nouȝt forgon
þat he nas Ielous euermore in oon
Which Ielousie it was so outrageous
þat neiþer in halle ne in non oþer hous
he nolde suffre hire for to ryde ne go
Ne in non oþer place neuer þe mo
But if þat he hadde hond on hire alway
ffor which ful ofte wepeþ freisshe may  
That loueþ Damyan so benignely
þat sche moot eyþer deye sodeinly
Or elles sche mote han him at hire leste
sche wayteþ whan hir herte wolde toberste
vpon þat oþer syde Damyan
Bycomen is þe sorwfulleste man
þat euere was for neiþer night nor day
Ne might he speke a word to freisshe may
  
As to his purpos of no such matiere 
But if þat Ianuarie most it here 
þat hadde oon hond on hir euer mo
And naþeles by wrytyng to and fro
And pryue signes wist he what sche ment
And sche knew of þe signe of his entent
O Ianuarie what mighte þe affayle 
þou mightest see as fer as schippes sayle
ffor a good is a blynd disceyued be
As to be deceyued whan a man may se
Lo argus which þat hadde an C eyen
ffor al þat euer he couþe poure or prien
ȝit was he blent and god wot so ben mo
þat wenyn wisly þat it nys nat so
Passe ouer is an ese and say nomore
This freissche may of which I spak of yore
In warm wax haþ emprynted þis cliket
þat Ianuarye bar of þis smale wyket
By which vnto his gardyn ofte he wente
And Damyan þat knew hire entente
þe clyket countrefeted priuily
Ther nys no more to say but hastyly
Som wonder by his cliket schal betyde 
Which ȝe schullen heere if ȝe woln abyde
O noble Ovyde soþ saist þou god wot
What sleight is it þough it be long and hoot
That he nyl fynde it out in som manere
By Pyramus and Thysbe may men leere  
þough þey were kepte ful longe streiȝt ouer al
þey ben acorded rownynge þurgh a wal
þer is no wight couþe han founde out such a sleiȝte
But now to purpos er þat dayes eyȝte
Were passed or þe monþe of Iuyl byfille
þat Ianuarye haþ caught so gret a wille
þurgh eggyng of his wijf him for to pleye
In his gardyn and no wight but þey tweye
  
That in a morwe vnto his may sayde he
Rise vp my wijf my loue my lady fre

The wynter is gon with alle his reynes weete
Com forþ now wiþ þin eyen columbyne
how fairer ben þy brestes þan is wyne

Come forþ my white spouse out of doute
þou hast me wounded in myn herte O wyf
No spotte in þe nas in al þy lyf
Com forþ and let vs taken oure disport
I chees þe for my wyff and my confort
Suche olde lowde wordes vsed he
On damyan a signe made sche
That he schulde go biforn wiþ his clyket
þis damyan haþ opened þe wyket
And in he sterte and þat in such manere
þat no wight might it se ne heere
And stille he sitt vnder a bussch anon
This Ianuare so blynd as is a stoon
Wiþ mayus in his hond and no wight mo
In to his freisshe gardyn is he go
And clapte to þe wyket sodeynly
Now wiff quod he her nys but þou and I
þat art þe creature þat I best loue
ffor by þat lord þat sitt vs alle aboue
I hadde leuer deyen on a knyf
Then þe offenden deere trewe wyf  
ffor goddes sake þenk how I þe chees
Nouȝt for no coueytise dowteles 
But oonly for þe loue I hadde to þe
And þough þat I be olde and may nouȝt se
Be to me trewe and I wol telle ȝou why
Certes þre þinges scholden ȝe wynne þerby
ffirst loue of crist and to ȝour self honour
And al myn heritage toun and tour
  
I ȝiue it ȝow makeþ Chartres as ȝou leste
This schal be do to morwe er sonnes reste
So wisly god my soule bringe in blisse
And preye ȝou on couenaunt þat ȝe me kisse
And þough þat I be Ielous wyte me nouȝt

And þer wiþ al þe vnlikly elde of me

fforbere to ben out of ȝour companye
ffor verray loue þis is wiþouten doute
Now kisse me wijf and let vs rome aboute
 This freissche may whan sche þis wordes herde
Benignely to Ianuarye answerde
But first and forward sche bygan to weepe
I haue quod sche a soule for to keepe
As wel as ȝe and also myn honour
And of my wifhede þilke tendre flour
Which þat I haue asseured in ȝour hand
Whan þat þe prest to yow my body band
Wherfore I wol answere in þis manere
Wiþ þe leue of ȝou my lord so deere
I pray god þat neuer dawe þat day
þat I ne sterue as foule as womman may
If euer I do vnto my kynne þat schame 
Oþer elles I empeyre so my name 
þat y be fals and if I do þat lak
To strype me and putte me in a sakk  
And in þe nexte ryuer do me drenche
I am a gentil womman and no wenche
Why speke ȝe þus but men ben euer vntrewe
And wommen han reproef of ȝou ay newe
ȝe can non oþer contynaunce I leeue
But speke to vs as vntriste and in repreue
And wiþ þat word sche saugh wher damyan
Sat in þe bussh and knelen he bigan
  
And wiþ hire fynger signes made sche
þat Damyan schulde clymbe vpon a tree
þat charged was wiþ fruyt and vp he wente
ffor verrayly he knew al hire entente
And euery signe þat sche couþe make
Wel bet þan Ianuarye hir owne make
ffor in a lettre sche hadde told him al
Of þis matiere how he worche schal
And þus I lete him sitte in þe Pyry
And Ianuarye and mayus rownynge myry
 Bright was þe day and blew þe firmament
Phebus of gold doun haþ his stremes sent
To gladen euery flour wiþ his warmnesse
he was þat tyme in Gemynys as I gesse
But litel fro his declynacion
Of Cancer Iouys exaltacion
And so bifelle þat in a bright morwetyde
þat in þe gardyn on þat ferþer syde 
Pluto þat is þe king of fayerye
And many a lady in his companye
ffolwyng his wyf þe queene proserpyna
Which þat he rauyssched out of Proserpyna
Whiles þat sche gaderede floures in a mede
In Claudian ȝe may þe storyes rede
how in his grysly carte he hire fette
This kyng of fayerie a doun him sette
vpon a benche of toruys freissch and grene
And right anon seyde he þus to his queene  
My wijf quod he þat may no wight seye nay
þe experiens proueþ it euery day
þe tresoun which þat womman doþ to man
Ten hundred þousand tellen I can 
Notable of ȝour vntrouþe and brytilnes
O Salamon richest of alle richesse
ffulfild of sapience and of worldly glorie
fful worþy ben þyne wordes to memorie
  
To euery wight þat witt and reson can
þus preiseþ he ȝit þe bounte of man
Among a þousand men ȝit fond I on
But of alle wommen fond he neuer noon
þus seiþ þe king þat knoweþ ȝoure wickednes 
And Ihesus filius Cyrak as I ges 
Ne spekeþ of ȝou but seeldyn reuerens
A wilde fuyre a corumpte pestilens
So falle vpon ȝour bodyes ȝit to nyght
Ne se ȝe nought þis honurable knight
By cause allas þat he is blynd and old
his owne man schal make him kokewold
Lo wher he sitte þe lecchour in þe tree
Now wol I graunte of myn mageste
vnto þis olde blynde worþy knight
þat he schal han aȝein his eyȝen sight
Whan þat his wijf wolde don him vylenye
þan schal he knowe al hire harlottrie
Boþe in repreef of hire and oþer mo
ȝe schal quod Proserpyn and wol ȝe so
Now by mo moodres syres soule I swere
þat I schal ȝeuyn hire suffisaunt answere
And alle wommen after for ȝour sake 
þat þough þey ben in eny gilt ytake
Wiþ face bold þei scholden hemself excuse
And bere hem doun þat wolden hem accuse 
ffor lakke of answere non of hem scholde deyen
Al hadde ȝe seye a þing wiþ boþe ȝour eyȝen  
ȝit schullen we so visagen it hardyly
And weepe and swere and chide subtyly
þat ȝe schuln ben as lewed as here gees
What rekkeþ me of ȝour auctoritees
I wot wel þis Iewe þis Salamon
ffand of vs wommen fooles many oon
But þough þat he ne fond no good womman
þer haþ Ifounde many anoþer man
  
Wommen ful trewe ful good ful vertuous
Witnesse on hem þat dwellen in cristes hous
Wiþ martirdom þey prouyd hir constance
þe Romayne Iestes maken remembrance
Of many a verray trewe wijf also
but sire ne beþ nouȝt wroþ as be it so
þouȝ þat he seyde he fond no good womman
I pray ȝou take þe sentence of þe man
he mente þus þat in souerayne bounte
Nis non but god but neyþer he ne sche
Ey for verray god þat nys but oon
What make ȝe so moche of Salamon
What þough he made a temple goddes hous
What þough he were riche and glorious
So made he a temple of false godis
Who mighte do a þing þat more forbode is
Parde as fayr as he his name inplastre
he was a lecchour and an ydolastre
And in his eelde he verry god forsook
And if þat god ne hadde as seiþ þe book
yspared him for his fadres sake he scholde
haue lost his regne sonner þan he wolde
I sette nouȝt of alle þe vylenye
þat ȝe of wommen wite a bottirflye
I am a womman needes moot I speke
Oþer elles swelle til myn herte breke
ffor siþenes he seyde þat we ben Iangeleresses
As euer mote I brouke boþe my tresses  
I schal not spare for no curtesye
To speke him harm þat wolde vs vilanye
Dame quod þis pluto be no lengere wroþ
I ȝiue it vp but seþens I swor myn oþ
þat I wolde graunten him his sight aȝein
My word schal stonde þat warne I þe certayn
I am a king it sitt me nouȝt to lye
And I quod sche a queen of fayerye
  
hire answere sche schal haue I vndertake
let vs no more wordes make
Thise olde gentile britouns in here dayes
Of diuerse auentures maden layes
Rymeden in here firste britoun tonge
Whiche layes with here instrumentz þey songe
Oþer elles radden hem for here plesaunce
And on of hem haue I in remembraunce
Which I schal seye wiþ as good wille as I can
But sires by cause þat I am a burel man
At my begynnyng first I ȝou beseche
haueþ me excused of my rude speche
I lerned neuer rethorik certayn
þing þat I speke it mot be bare and playn
I slepte neuer on þe mount of pernaso
Ne neuer lered Marcus Thullius ne Cithero
Colours of Rethorik ne knowe I non wiþouten drede
But suche coloures as growen in þe mede
Oþir elles suche as men dye or peynte
Colours of Rethorik ben me to queynte
Myn spyrit feleþ nought of such matere
But if ȝe luste my tale schul ȝe not here
Ther was a knight þat loued and did his peyne
In amoryke þat cleped is Briteyne
To seruen a lady in his beste wise
And many a labour and many a gret emprise
  
he for his lady wrouȝt er sche were wonne
ffor sche was on þe fairest vnder sonne  
And eek þerto come of so heih kynrede
That wel vnneþes durst þis knight for drede
Telle hire his wo his peyne and his distresse
But atte laste sche for his worþinesse
And namely for his meke obeissance
haþ such a pite caught of his penaunce
That priuely sche felle of his acord
To take him for hir housbonde and hire lord
Of such lordschipe as men han ouer here wyues
And for to lede þe more in blisse here lyues
Of his fre wille he swor hire as a knight
þat neuer in his wille by day ne by night
Ne schulde he vpon him take no maystrie
Aȝeins hire wille ne kuyþe hire Ialousye
But hire obeye and folwe hire wille in al
As ony louere to his lady schal
Saue þat þe name of souereynete
That wolde he han for schame of his degre
Sche þankeþ him and wiþ ful gret humblesse
Sche sayde sire seþþen of your gentilnesse
ȝe profre me to han a large reyne
Ne wolde neuer god betwixe vs tweyne
As in my gilt were eyþer werre or stryf
Sire I wil be ȝour owne humble trewe wijf
haue here my trouþe til þat myn herte breste
Thus be þey boþe in quiete and in reste
ffor o þing syres saufly dar I seye
That frendes euerich oþer mote obeye
If þay wole longe holde companye
loue wol nought ben constreigned by maystrie
Whan maystrie comeþ þe god of loue anon
Beteþ on his wynges and fare wel he is gon
loue is a þing as any spiryt fre
Wommen of kynde desiren liberte
  
And nouȝt to be constreigned as a þral
And so do men if I þe soþe seye schal  
loke who þat is most pacient in loue 
he is at his auauntage aboue
Pacience is an heih vertu certeyn
ffor it venquissheþ as þese clerkes seyn
Thynges þat Rigor schulde neuer atteigne
ffor euery word men may nouȝt chyde ne pleyne 
lerneþ to suffre or elles so mote I gon
ȝe schullen it lerne wheþer ȝe wole or non
ffor in þis worlde certeyn no wight nys 
þat he ne doþ or saiþ sumtyme amys 
Or oþir siknesse oþer constillacion
Wyn wo or chaungyng of complexion
Causeþ ful often to don amys oþer speken
On euery wrong men may nouȝt ben awreken
After þe tyme moste be temperaunce
To euery wight þat can no gouernance 
And þerfore haþ þis worþy wise knight
To lyue in ese suffraunce hire behight
And sche to him ful wisly gan to swere
That neuer schulde þer be defaute in here 
here may men sen an humble wyse acord
Thus haþ sche take hir seruant and hire lord
Seruaunt in loue and lord in mariage
Then was he boþe in lordschipe and seruage
Seruage nay but in lordschipe aboue
Seþyns þat he haþ boþe his lady and his loue
his lady certes and his wyf also
The whiche þat lawe of loue acordeþ þer to
And whan he was in þis prosperite
home wiþ his wyf he goþ to his cuntre
Nouȝt fer fro pedmark þer as his dwellyng was
Wher as he lyueþ in blisse and in solas
Who couþe telle but he hadde wedded be
þe ioye þe ese and þe prosperite 
  
That is bitwixe an housebond and his wyf
A ȝeer and more lasted þis blisful lijf  
Til þat þis knight of which I spak of þus
þat of kynrede was cleped arneragus
Schope him to gon and dwelle a ȝeer or tweyne
In engelond þat cleped eek was bretayne
To seche in armes worschipe and eek honour
ffor alle his lust he sette in such labour
And dwelleþ þere þe book saiþ þus
Now wol I stynte of þis arneragus
And speken I wole of dorygen his wijf
þat loueþ hir housbonde as hire hertes lyf
And for his absens wepeþ sche and sikeþ 
As don þese noble wyues when hem likeþ
Sche mourneþ wakeþ wayleþ fasteþ and pleyneþ
Desire of his presence hire so destreyneþ
That alle þis wyde world sche sette at nouȝt
hire freendes which þat knewe hire heuy þouȝt
Conforted hire in al þat euer þey mighte or may
They prechen hire þay tellen hire night and day
þat causeles sche sleeþ hire self allas 
And euery confort possible in þis cas
þey don to hire wiþ alle here busynes 
And alle to make hire lete hir heuynes
By processe as ȝe knowe wel euerychon
Men may so longe grauen in þe ston
Til som figure þerinne enprentyd be
So longe han þey conforted hire þat sche
Receyued haþ by hope and by reson
The empryntyng of hir constillacion
Thurgh which hire grete sorwe gan aswage 
Sche may nought alway endure in such a rage 
And eek arneragus in al þis care
haþ sent his lettres home in al þis fare
And þat he wolde come hastly aȝayn
Oþer hadde þis sorwe hire herte slayn
  
hire frendes sawe hire herte gan to slake 
And preyed hire on knees for goddes sake  
To come and rome hire in companye
Away to dryue hire derke fantasye
And fynally sche graunted þat requeste
ffor wel sche sawe it was for þe beste
Now stood hire castel faste by þe see
And often wiþ hire freendes walked sche
hire to disporte on þe banke on heih
Wher as sche many schippe and barge seih
Seylinge here cours where hem luste to go
But ȝit was þere a parcelle of hir wo
ffor to hir self ful often seyde sche
Is þer no schippe of so many as I se
Wole brynge home my lord þen wolde myn herte
Al waryssche of þis bitter peynes smerte
Anoþer tyme þer wole sche sitte and þinke
And caste hire eyen dounward fro þe brynke
But whan sche saugh þe grisly rokkes blake
ffor verray fere so wolde hire herte quake
þat on hire feet sche mighte nought hire sustene
Thenne wolde sche sitte a doun vpon þe grene
And pitously in to þe see byholde
And sayn right þus wiþ sorowful hertes colde
Eterne god þat þurgh þy puruyaunce
ledest þe world by certein gouernaunce
In ydelnesse as men sayn ȝe no þing make
But lord þese grisely feendly rokkes blake
That semen raþer a foul confusion
Of werk þen any fayr creacion
Of whiche a parfyt god and a stable
Why han ȝe wrouȝt þis werk vnresonable
ffor by þis werke south north est and west
Ther nys yfostred man ne bryd ne best
hit doþ no good to my witt but annoyeþ
Se ȝe nouȝt lorde how mankynde it destroyeþ
  
An hundred þousand bodyes of mankynde 
han rokkes slayn al be þey nouȝt in mynde  
Which mankynde is a fair part of þy werk
That þou it madest ylike to þin hond werk
Thenne semed it ȝe hadde a gret chierte
Toward mankynde but how þan may it be
That ȝe suche menys make it to distroyen
Whiche menys doþ no good but euer annoyen
I wot wel clerkes woln sayn as hem leste
By argumentz þat al þing is for þe beste
Though I ne can þe causes for soþe knowe
but þilke god þat made wynd to blowe
As kepe my lord þis is my conclusion
To clerkes lete I al disputacion
But wolde god þat alle þe rokkes blake
Were sonken in to helle for his sake 
These rokkes sleen myn herte for feere
Thus wolde sche sayn with many a pitous teere
hire freendes sawe þat nas no disport
To romen by þe see but discomfort
And schopen for to pleyen som where elles 
þey leden hire by Ryueres and by welles
And eek in oþer places delitables
þey daunce and pleye at Chesse and at tables
So on a day right on þe morne tyde
vnto a gardyne þat was right þere besyde
In which þat þey hadde made here ordynance
Of vitaile and of oþer puruyaunce
They gon and pleyen hem al þe longe day
And þis was on þe sixte morwe of may
Which may hadde peynted wiþ his softe schoures 
This gardyn ful of leues and of floures
And wiþ crafte of mannes hande so curiously
Arayed haþ þis gardyn trayelly
That neuer nas þer gardyn of such prys
But if it were þe verrey paradys
  
The odure of floures and þe freisshe sight 
Wolde han made ony pensyf herte light  
That euer was born  but if to gret siknesse 
Oþer to gret sorwe hyld it in distresse 
And after dynere gan þey to daunce
So ful it was of beaute with plesaunce 
And synge also but dorigen allone
Sche made alwey hire compleynt and hire mone
ffor sche ne saugh him on þe daunce go
þat was hire housbond and hir loue also
But naþeles sche moste a tyme abyde 
And with good hope sche let hir sorwe glyde
vpon þis daunce amonges oþer men
Daunced a squier biforen Dorigen
That freisscher was and iolyer of array
As to my dome þan is þe monþe of May
he syngeþ and daunceþ passyng any man
That is or was siþenes þis world bygan
Ther wiþ he was if men schulde him discryue 
On þe beste farynge man on lyue 
ȝong strong right vertuous riche and wys
And wel biloued and holden in gret prys
And schortliche if þe soþe telle I schal
vnwytyng of þis Dorigen at al
This lusty squyer seruaunt to venus
Which þat ycleped was Aurelius
had loued hire best of eny creature
Tuo ȝeer and more as was his aduenture 
But neuer durste he telle hire of his greuance
Wiþoute cuppe he drank al his penaunce
he was dispeyred no þing durst he seye
Saue in his sawe somwhat wolde he wreye
his woo as in general compleynyng
he sayde he louede and was biloued noþing
Of such matiere made he many layes
Songes compleigntes roundeletis virrelayes
  
how þat he durste nouȝt his sorwe telle 
That langusshiþ as fuyre doþ in helle  
And deye seyde he moste as did Ekko
ffor narsisus þat durste nouȝt telle hir wo
In oþer manere þenne ȝe here me seye
Ne durst he nouȝt to hire his wo bewreye
Saue peraduenture som tyme at daunces
There ȝong folk kepen here obseruaunces
hit may wel be he loked on hire face
In such a wise as man þat askeþ grace
But no þing wiste sche of his entent
Naþeles it happed or þey þennes went
By cause þat he was hire neyȝebourre 
And was a man of worschipe and honour
And hadde knowen him ofte tymes ȝore 
þey felle in speche ofte more and more 
vnto his purpos drowe aurelius
And whan he saw his tyme he sayde þus
Ma dame quod he by god þat þis world made
So þat I wiste it mighte ȝour herte glade
I wolde þat day þat ȝoure arneragus 
Wente on þe see þat I aurelius
had went þat I schulde neuer haue come aȝain
ffor wel I woot my seruise is in vayn
My guerdon nys but berstyng of myn herte 
Ma dame reweþ vpon my peynes smerte
ffor as wiþ a swerd ȝe may me sle or saue
her at ȝoure foot god wolde þat I were graue 
I haue as now no more leysir for to seye 
haue mercy on me swete or ȝe wolen do me deye
Sche gan to loke vpon aurelius
Is þis ȝoure wille quod sche and say ȝe þus
Neuer erst quod sche ne wist I what ȝe mente
But now Aurely I knowe ȝoure entente
By þilke god þat ȝaf me soule and lyf
Ne schal I neuer be vntrewe wyf
  
In word ne in werk as fer as I haue wit 
I wole ben his to whom þat I am knyt  
But after þat in pleyn þus seyde sche 
Tak þis for fynal answer as for me 
Aurely quod sche by hihe god aboue
ȝit wol I graunte ȝou to be ȝoure loue
Seþyns I ȝou se so pitously compleyne 
loke what day þat engelond is Bryteyne 
ȝe remewe alle þe rokkes ston by stoon
þat þay ne lette schip no boot to goon
I say whan ȝe han made þese costes so clene
Of Rokkes þat þer nys no ston ysene 
þan wol I loue ȝou best of any man
haue here my trouþe in al þat euer I can
Is þere non oþer grace quod he 
No by þat lord quod sche þat made me
ffor wel I wot þat þat schal neuer betyde
let such folye out of ȝour herte glyde
What deynte schulde man haue by his lijf
ffor to loue anoþer mannes wyf
That haþ hir body whan so þat him likeþ
Aurelius ful ofte sore sikeþ 
Wo was aurely whan þat he þis herde 
And wiþ a sorwful herte þus answerde 
ma dame quod he þis were impossible 
Thenne mot I deye on sodeyn deþ orrible 
And wiþ þat word he torned him anon
þo came hire oþer frendes many oon
And in þe aleyes romed vp and don
And no þing wiste of þis conclusion
But sodeinly bygan to reuel newe 
Til þat þe brighte sonne loste his hewe 
ffor thorisowte haþ raft þe sonne his light
þis is as moche to say as it was night
And home þey gon in Ioye and in solas 
Saue oonly wrecched aurelius allas 
  
he to his hous is gon wiþ sorwful herte
he seiþ he may not fro his deþ asterte  
him semeþ he feliþ his herte colde
vp to þe heuene his handes gan he holde
And on his knees bare he sette him don
And in his rauynge sayde his orison
ffor verray wo out of his witte he breyde 
he nyste nouȝt what he spak but þus he seyde
Wiþ pitous herte haþ he his compleint bygonne
vnto þe goddesse and first vnto þe sonne
he sayde appollo god and gouernour
And euery plaunte herbe tre and flour
þat ȝeuest after þi declinacion
To ilk of hem his tyme and his sesoun
And þin herborwe chaungeþ lowe and heiȝe
lord Phebus cast þin merciable eyȝe
On wrecched Aurely þat am but lorn
lo lord my lady haþ my deþ ysworn
Wiþouten gilt but þin benignite

But wel I wot lord Phebus if ȝou leste
ȝe may me helpe saue my lady beste
Now voucheþ sauf þat I may ȝou deuyse
how þat I may be holpe and in what wyse

Though Neptunus haue deyte in þe see

Is to be quyked and leteþ of ȝoure fire
ffor which sche folweþ ȝou ful besyly
Right so þe see desireþ naturelly
To folwen hire as sche þat is goddesse
Boþe in þe see and in Ryueres more and lesse
Wherfore lord Phebus þis is myn requeste
Do þis myracle or I do myn herte to breste

Which in þe signe schal be of þe leoun  
And preyed hire so gret a flood to brynge
That v fatheme at þe leste it ouer springe

And lete his flood endure ȝeres twayne
Thenne certes to my lady may I saye
holdeþ ȝoure hestes þe rokkes ben awaye
lord Phebus do þis myracle for me
Pray hire sche go no faster cours þan ȝe
I say ȝou þus pray ȝour suster þat sche go
None faster cours þan ȝe þis ȝeres tuo
Then schal sche be euer at þe fulle alway
And springe flood lasten boþe night and day
And but sche fouche sauf in such manere
To graunte me my lady souerein dere 
Preye hire to synken euery rokke a doun
In to hire owne darke Region
vnder þe grounde þer Pluto duelleþ Inne
Oþer neuer more schal I my lady wynne
Thy temple in Delphos wol I barfoot seeke
lord Phebus seeþ þe teeres on my cheeke 
And of my peyne haue compassion
And wiþ þat word in swowne he felle a doun
And long tyme he lay in a traunce
his broþer which þat knew of his penaunce
vp caught him and to bedde him broughte
Dispeyred in his torment and in his þought
Lo y þis woful creature lete lye
Chese he for me wheþer he wol lyue or dye
Arneragus wiþ hele and gret honour
As he was of Chyualry þe flour
Is comen home and oþere worþy men
O blisful art þou Dorigen
þat hast þin lusty housbonde in þin armes
þe freissche knight þe worþy man of armes
  
That loueþ þe as his owen hertes lyf
No þing luste he to be ymaginatyff  
Of any wight hadde spoke while he was oute
To hire of loue he made þerof no doute
he nouȝt entendeþ to no such matere
But daunceþ Iustiþ and makeþ good cheere
As þus in Ioye and blisse I lete hem dwelle
And of þe swete Aurelyus wol I telle
In langure and in furious tormentz þus
Tuo ȝer and more lay wrecche aurelius
Or ony foot on erþe he mighte gon
No confort in þis tyme nade he non
Saue of his broþer which þat was a clerk
he knew of al þis wo and of al þis werk
ffor to non oþer creature certeyn
Of þis matiere ne durste he no word seyn
vnder his brest he bar it more secre
Then euer did Pamphilius for Galathe
his brest was hole wiþouten for to sene
But in his herte was ay þe arwe kene
And wel ȝe knowen þat a sore sauure
In surgerie ful perilous is þe cure
But man might touche þe arwe or come þerby
his broþer wepeþ and wayleþ priuyly
Til atte laste him felle in remembraunce
That whiles he was at Orlyaunce in ffraunce
As ȝonge clerkes þat ben likerous
To reden artes þat ben curious
Seken in euery halk and euery herne
Particuler sciences for to lerne
he him remembreþ vpon a day
At Orlyaunce in studye a book he say
Of magique naturell which his felawe
That was þat tyme a bachiler of lawe
Al were he þere to lerne anoþer craft
And priuely vpon his deske ylaft
  
This book spak mochil of þis operacions
Touchynge þe xviij mancions  
That longen to þe mone and suche folye
As in oure dayes nys nought worþ a flye
ffor holy chirche saiþ in oure byleeue
Ne suffreþ non illusion vs to greeue
And whan þis book was in remembraunce
Anon for ioye he gan for to daunce
And to himselue sayde pryuely
My broþer schal be warisshed hastily
ffor I am siker þat þer ben sciences
By whiche men maken dyuerse apparences 
Whiche as þe subtile tregetoures pleyen
ffor ofte at festes herde I seyen
That tregettours wiþinne an halle large
han made in come water and a barge 
And in þe halle rowen vp and doun
Som tyme haþ semed a grym leoun

somtyme a vyne and grapes  white and rede
Som tyme a castel al of lym and ston
And whan hem liked voyded it anon
þus semed it to euery mannes sight
Now þenne conclude I þus if þat I might
At Orliaunce som olde felawe Ifynde
That hadde þe moones manciouns in mynde
Oþer magike naturel aboue
he scholde wel make my broþer han his loue 
ffor wiþ apparens a man may make
To mannes sight þat alle þe Rokkes blake
Of Britaigne were ywent euerychon
And schippes by þe brinke mighte comen and goon
And in such forme endure a ȝeer or tuo
þen were my broþer warissched of his wo
þen most sche needes knowen hire byheste
Or elles he schal schamen hire at þe leste
  
What schulde I make a lenger tale of þis
Vnto his broþer bedde come he is
And such confort he ȝaff him for to gon
To Orlyaunce þat he vpstarte anon  
And on his way forþward is he fare
In hope to ben ylissed of his care 
When þay were come almost to þat Cite
But if it were a tuo forlong oþir þre
A ȝong clerk romyng by himself þey mette
Which þat in latyn thriftily hem grette
And after þat he sayde a wonder þing
I knowe quod he þe cause of ȝoure comyng
And er þey forþer any foote went
he tolde hem alle þat was in here entent
This brytoun clerk him asked of felawes
The which þat he had knowen in olde dawes
And he answerde him þat þey dede were 
ffor which he wepe ful ofte many a tere
Doun of his hors Aurelius light anon
And forþ wiþ þis magicien forþ is he gon
home to his hous and made hem wel at ese 
hem lacked no vitayle þat hem might plese 
So wel arrayed hous as þer was oon
Aurelius in his lyf saugh noon
He schewed him er he wente to sopere
fforestes parkes ful of wilde deere

pasturynge right faire  and merilie
he saw of hem an hundred  sleyn with houndes
and somme with arwis blede  and bitter woundes
he saw when voided were  the wilde dere
these ffaukeners  vppon a faire Rivere
And how ffaukons han þe heron slayne
Then sawe he knightes iusten in a playne
And after þis he dide him such plesaunce
That he him schewed his lady in a daunce
  
On which himself he daunced as him þought
And whan þis mayster þat þis magique wrought
Sawh it was tyme to clappe his hondes tuo
And fare wel al oure reuel is ydo
And ȝit remewe þey neuer out of þis hous 
Whiles þey sawe al þis sight merueylous
But in his study þer as his bookes be
þey saten stille and no wight but þey þre
To him his mayster called þanne a squiere
And seyde him þus is redy oure sopere  
Almost an hour it is I vndertake
Seþyns I ȝou bad oure souper to make
When þat þis worþy men wenten with me
vnto my study þer as my bokes be
Sire quod this squyer when it likeþ ȝou
It is al redy þey ȝe wolen right now 
Go we þen soupe quod he and for þe beste 
These auerous folk som tyme mote haue reste
And after souper felle þey in trete
What somme schulde þis maystres guerdon be 
Te remewe alle þe rokkes of Brytaigne
And eek fro Geroun to þe mouþ of Sayne
he made it straunge  and swore so god him saue
lasse þan a þousand pound he nolde nouȝt haue
Ne gladly for þat somme ne wolde he gon
Aurelius wiþ blisful herte anon
Answerde þus fy on a þousand pound
þis wyde worlde þat men seyn is round
þat wolde I ȝiue if I were lord of it
This bargayn is ful dryue for we be knyt 
Ȝe schulle be payed trewely by my trouþe
But lokeþ now for no necligence or slouþe
ȝe tary vs heere no lenger þan to morwe
Nay quod þis clerk haue heer my trouþe to borwe
To bedde is gon aurelius whan him liste
And wel neigh al þat night he hadde his reste
  
That for his labour and for his hope of blisse
his woful herte of penaunce hadde a lisse
vpon þis morwe when þat it was day
To Britaigne toke þay þe righte way
Aurelius and þis magicien besyde
And ben descendid þer þey woln abyde
And þis was as þe bokes me remembre
þe colde frosty sesoun of Decembre
Phebus wax olde and hewed lik latoun
That in his hoote declinacion  
Schon as þe burnyd gold wiþ stremes bright
But now in Scorpion a doun he light
Wher as he schon ful pale I dar wel sayn
The bitter frostes wiþ þe slete and rayn
Destroyed haþ þe grene in euery ȝerde 
Ianus sit by þe furye wiþ double berde
And drynkeþ of his bugle horn þe wyn
Biforn him stant þe braun of tuxed swyn
And a nowel cryeþ euery lusty man
Aurelius in al þat euer he can
Doþ to his maister cheere and reuerence
And preyeþ him to don his diligence
To bryngen him out of his peynes smerte
Or wiþ a swerd þat he wolde slitte his herte
þat subtil clerk which þat rouþe hadde of þis man
þat night and day he him spedde þat he ne lan
To wayte a tyme of his conclusion
This is to say to make illusioun
I ne can no termes of astrologie 
By which an apparence of Iogellerie 
That sche and euery wight scholde wene and seye
þat of Britaigne þe rokkes were aweye
Oþer elles þey were sonken vnder grounde
So atte laste whan þat he his tyme fonde
To make his Iapes and his wrecchednes
Of which a supersticious cursednesse
  
his tables colletanes forþ he brought
fful wel corrected ne þer lakked nouȝt
Ne his collectes ne his expans ȝeres
Ne his rotes ne his oþer geres 
As ben his centrys and his argumentz
And his proporcions conuenientz
ffor his equacions in euery þing
And by his viij spere in his werkynge
he knew how fer Alnaþe was yschoue
ffro þe hede of þilke fixe aries aboue  
That in þe ixe spere considered is
fful subtilly he calkeþ al þis 
And whan he hadde founde his firste mansion
he knewe þe remenaunt by proporcion
And knewe þe arisyng of þe mone wel
And in whos face and terme euery del
And knew ful wel þe moones mansion
acordant to his operacion
And knew also his oþer obseruaunces 
ffor suche illusions and suche meschaunces 
As heþin folk vsed þilke dayes
ffor whiche no lenger maked he delayes
But þough his magik for a wike or tweye 
It semed as alle þe rokkes were aweye
Aurelyus which þat dispeyred is
Wheþer he schal han his loue or fare amys
Awayteþ night and day of þis myracle 
And whan he knewe þat þer was non obstacle
þat voyded were þise rokkes euerychon
Doun to þis maistres feet he felle anon
And seyde I woful wrecche aurelius
þanke ȝou lord and lady myn venus
That me han holpe fro my cares colde 
And to þe temple forþ his way haþ holde
Where he knewe he scholde his lady se
And whan he saugh his tyme anon right he
  
Wiþ dredful herte and humble cheere 
Salued haþ his souerayn lady deere 
My rightful lady quod þis woful man
Whom I most drede and loue as I best kan
And loþest were of alle þis world displese 
Nere it þat I for ȝou haue suche disese
That I moste dye her at ȝour foot anon
But not wolde I telle how me is wo bygon
But certes eyþer most I deye or pleyne 
ȝe sleen me gilteles for verrey peyne   
But of my deþ þough ȝe haue no rouþe
Auyseþ ȝou er þat ȝe lese ȝour trouþe
Repentiþ ȝou for þilke god aboue 
Or ȝe me sleen by cause þat I ȝou loue 
ffor ma dame wel ȝe wot þat ȝe han hight
Nought þat I chalenge eny þing of right
Of ȝou souereyne lady but ȝoure grace
But in a gardyn ȝonde at such a place
ȝe wot right wel þat ȝe behighte me
And in myn hande my trouþe plighte me
To loue me best god wot ȝe sayde so
Al be þat I vnworþy am þerto
Madame I speke it for þe honour of ȝow
More þen to saue myn hertes lyf right now 
I haue don so as ȝe haue commannded me
And if ȝe vouche sauf ȝe may go se 
And as ȝou luste haueþ ȝoure byheste in mynde
ffor quyk or deed right þus ȝe schulle me fynde
In ȝow liþ al to do me lyue or deye
But wel I wot þe rokkes ben aweye 
he took his leeue and sche astoned stood
In alle hir face þer nas a drop of blood
Sche wende neuer han comyn in such a trappe
Allas quod sche þat þis euer schulde happe
ffor wende I neuer by possibilite
þat such a muster or such a meruaile schulde be
  
It is aȝein þe processe of nature
And home sche goþ a sorwsul creature
ffor verray feere vnneþes may sche go
Sche wepeþ and wayleþ a day or tuo
And swowneþ þat it rouþe was to se
But why it was to no wight tolde sche
ffor out of toune was gon arneragus
But to hir self sche sayde and spak þus
In hire compleynt as ȝe schullen after heere
Wiþ face pale and wiþ sorweful cheere  
Allas quod sche on þe fortune I pleyne
That vnwar hast wrapped me in þi cheyne
ffor which þe eschape wot I no socour
Saue oonly deþ oþer elles dishonour
On of þese tuo bihoueþ me to chese
But naþeles ȝit hadde I leuer to lese 
My lif þan of my body to han a schame
Oþer knowe my self fals oþer lese my name 
And wiþ my deþ I may be quyte ywys
haþ þer nouȝt many a wyf er þis
And many a mayden yslayn hem self allas
Raþir þan wiþ here bodyes don trespas
And certes lo þise stories beren witnesse
Whan xxx tyrauntz ful of cursednesse
hadde slayn Phydon in athenes atte leste
þey comaunded his douȝtres to areste 
And bryngen hem byforn hem in dispyt
Al naked to fulfille here foule delyt
And in here fadres blod þey made hem daunce
vpon þe pament god ȝeue hem meschaunce
ffor whiche þese woful maydens ful of drede 
Raþer þan þey wolde lese here maydenhede

And dreynt hemselue as þe bookes tell

Of lacedemye L maydens eeke
  
On which þey wolden don here leccherie
But was þer non of al þat companye 
þat sche nas slayn and wiþ a glad entent
Chese raþir for to dye þan for to assent
To ben oppressed of here maydenhede
Why schulde I þanne to deye ben in drede
lo eke þe tyraunt Anstoclydes

Whan þat hir fader slayn was on a night
vnto þe Dyanes temple goþ sche anon right

ffro which ymage wolde sche neuere go
No wight might of hit hir armes race
Til sche was slayn in þe selue place 
Now seþyns þat maydens hadde such despit
To ben defouled wiþ mannes foul delyt
Wel aught a wyf raþer hirself to sle

þat schal I sayn of hasdrubaldes wyf
That at kartage byraft hir self hir lyf
ffor whan sche sawh þat Romayns wan þe toun
Sche took hir children alle and swept a doun
In to þe fuyr and ches raþer to dye

At Rome þere sche oppressed was
Of Tarquyn for hir þought it was a schame 
To lyue whan þat sche had lost hire name 
The viij maydens of Milesye also 
han slayn hem self for drede and for wo
Raþir þan folke of gaule scholde hem oppresse 
Mo þen a þousend stories as I gesse 
Couþe I now telle as touchinge þis matere
Whan habradas was slayn his wyf so dere
hire self slough and let hir blood to glyde
In habradas woundes brode and wyde 
  
And seyde my body at þe leste way
þer schal no wight defoule it if þat I may
What schulde I mo ensamples her of sayn
Siþþen þat so many han hemselue slayn
Wel raþer þan þey wolde defouled be 
I wol conclude what is best for me

I wol be trewe  to Arueragus
Oþir raþer sle my self in som manere
As Demonicious doughter dere
By cause þat sche nolde not defouled be 
O Cedasus it is ful gret pite  
To reden how þi doughtren deyeden allas

As gret appetyt was it or more
The Theban mayden þat for Nichasore

another Theban maiden dide right so

ffor on of Macedoigne hadde hire oppressed
þat schal I sayn of Nicharatiffs wijf
þat for such cas byrafte hir self hir lyf

lo which a wyf was Alcestem quod sche
What Emore of good Penolope 
Al Grece knoweþ of hir chastite
Pardee of leodomia is write þus
That when at Troye was slayn protheselayus
No lenger nolde sche lyue after his day
The same of noble Porcia I telle may
Wiþoute Brutus couþe sche not lyue
To whom he hadde al hol his herte ȝiue
The parfyt wyfhod of archemesy

O teuta queen in þy wyfly chastite
To alle wyfes may a myrour be
   
    
þus playned Dorigen a day or tweye
Purposed euere þat sche wolde deye
But naþeles vpon þe þridde night
hom cam arneragus þe worþy knight
And asked hire why þat sche weep so sore
And sche gan weepen euer lenger þe more
Allas quod sche þat euer was I born
þus haue I seyd quod he þus haue I sworn
I told him alle as ȝe han herde bifore
It needeþ nouȝt to rehersen it nomore
This housbond wiþ glad cheere in sondry wise 
Answerd and sayde as I schal ȝou deuyse   
Is þer ought elles Dorigen but þis
Nay nay quod sche god help me so as wis
This is to meche and it were goddes wille
ȝe wyf quod he let slepe þat is stille
It may be wel ȝit peraduenture to say
ȝe schullen ȝour trouþe holden by my fay
ffor god so wisly helpe me
I hadde wel leuere ystiked for to be 
ffor verray loue which þat I to ȝou haue
But if ȝe schulde ȝoure trouþe saue
Trouþe is ȝe heihest þing þat man may kepe
But wiþ þat word he brast anon to weepe 
And sayde I ȝou forbede vp payne of deþ
That neuer whiles þe lasteþ lyf and breþ
To no wight telle how þat þis matere 
As I may kepe I wole my woo endere
Ne make no contynaunce of heuynesse
That folk of ȝou may deme harme or gesse
And forþ he cleped a squyer and a mayde
Goþ forþ anon wiþ Dorigen he sayde 
  
And bringeþ hire to such a place anon
þey tooke her leue and on þair way þey gon
But þey ne wiste why sche þider wente
he nolde no wight telle hire entente
    
    
    
    
    
    
This squyer which þat hight Aurelyus
On Dorigen which þat was so amerous
Of aduenture happed hire to mete
Amyd þe toun right in þe quyke strete
As sche was boun to gon þe wey forþ right
Toward þe gardyn þer as sche hadde hight
And he was to þe gardynward also
ffor wel he spyed whan sche wolde go
Out of hir hous to eny maner place
But þus þey mette of auenture or of grace
And he saluyþ hire wiþ glad entent
And axed of hire whider þat sche wente   
And sche answerde half as sche were mad
vnto þe gardyn as myn housbonde bad
My trouþe for to holde allas allas
Aurelius gan wonder of þis caas
And in his herte had gret compassion
Of hire and of hire lamentacion
And of Arneragus þe worþy knight
And bad hire holde al þat sche hight
So loþ he was his wijf schulde breke hir trouþe
And in his herte he caste of þis gret rouþe
Considerynge þe beste on euery syde 
That fro his luste were him better abyde
Than don so heigh a cherles wrecchednes
Aȝeins fraunchise and aȝein al gentilnes
  
ffor which in fewe wordes sayde he þus
Ma dame seiþ to ȝoure lord Arneragus
þat seþyns I se þis grete gentilnes 
To ȝou and ek I se wel ȝoure distres
þen ȝe to me þus schulde breke ȝoure trouþe
Certes me þinkeþ it were right gret rouþe
I haue wel leuer euer to suffre wo
þen I departe þe loue betwixe ȝou tuo
I ȝou relesse ma dame in to ȝoure hand
Quyte euery surement and euery band
That ȝe han made to me as here byforn
Siþens þilke tyme that ȝe were born
My trouþe I plight I schal ȝou neuer repreue
Of no biheste and here I take my leue 
As of þe trewest and þe beste wyf
þat euer ȝit I knew in al my lyf
But euery wight be war of hire byheste
On Dorigen remembreþ atte leste 
Thus can a squier don a gentil dede
As wel as can a knight wiþouten drede
Sche þanked him vppon hir knees al bare
And home vnto hire housbonde is sche fare  
And tolde hem alle as ȝe han herde me sayde
And be ȝe siker he was so wel apayde 
þat it were inpossible to write 
What schulde I lengere of þis cas endite 
Arneragus and dorigen his wijff
In souerayn blisse leden forþ here lyff
Neuer eft ne was þer anger hem betwene
he cherisscheþ hire as þough sche were a quene
And sche was to him trewe for euermore
Aurelius þat his cost haþ al forlore
Curseþ þe tyme þat euer he was yborn
ffor certes he seiþ I am forlorn
Allas quod he allas þat I behight
Of pured gold a þousand pound of wight
  
vnto þis philosofre how schal I do
I se no more but þat I am fordo 
Myn heritage moot I needes selle
And ben a beggere here may I no lenger dwelle
And schamen al my kynrede in þis place
But I of him may gete bettre grace 

at certeyne dayes  yere bi yere to paye
I wole þonke him of his grete curtesye
My trouþe wol I kepe I wol nouȝt lye
Wiþ herte sore he goþ vnto his coffre
And broughte gold vnto his philosophre
The value of v hundred pound I gesse
And him besecheþ of his gentilnesse
To graunte him dayes of þe remenant
And maister I dar wel make auaunt
I fayled neuer my trouþe as ȝit
ffor sikerly my dettes schal be quyt
Towardes ȝou how euer þat I fare
To gon abegged in my kirtel bare
But wolde ȝe fouche sauf vpon suerte
Two ȝere or þre to respiten me
þenne were I wel for elles moste I selle 

this Philosophre soburly answerde
and seide thus  whan he these wordes herde
haue I nat holden couenaunt  vnto the
yis certes  wel and trewely  quod he

no no quod he  and sorowfully he siketh
what was the cause  telle me if thou can
Aurelius his tale  anoon bigan
and tolde him al  as ye han herde bifore
hit nedith nat  to rehersen it no more
he seide Arueragus  of gentilnesse
had leuer dien  in sorow and distresse
  
than his wiff  were of hir trouthe fals
the sorow of Dorigen  he told him als
how loth hir was  to ben a wikked wiff
and that she leuere had that day lost hir liff
and that hir trouthe she swore  thorugh innocence
she neuere erst herde speke  of apparence
that made me han of hir  so grete pite
and right as frely  as he sente hir to me
as frely sente I hir  to him ageyne
this is al and som  ther is no more to seyne
this Philosophre answerde  leue brother  
eueryche of yow dide gentilly  to other
thow art a squyer  and he is a knyght
but god forbede  for his blisful myght
but if a Clerke  couthe do a gentil dede

sir I relece the  thi thousand pounde
as thow right now  were crope out of the grounde

and toke his hors  and forth he goth his way
lordinges this question  than wold I axe now
whiche was the most fre  as thenketh yow

The ministre and norice  vnto vices

til that a man be hente  right bi the lappe

And though men dradden neuere  for to die

 And for to putten vs  from suche Idelnesse
that cause is  of so grete confusion
I haue here don  my feithful besynesse

right after thi glorious liff  and passion

Of hem þat atte seyntes reuerence

And pray I ȝou þat ȝe woln my werk amende
fferst wolde I ȝou þe name of seint Cecile
Expoune as men may in here stories se
It is to say on englissh heuene lylye
ffor pure chastnesse of virginite 
Oþer for sche witnesse hadde of honeste
Of greue of conscience and of good fame
The soote sauour lilye was hire name
Ouþer Cecile is to say þe way to blynde
ffor sche ensample was by good techynge
Or elles Cecile is as I writen fynde
Is ioyned by a maner conioygnynge
Of heuen and lya and heiher in figuringe
The heuen is set for þought of holynesse
And lya for hire lastyng busynesse 
Cecile may eek be sayd in þis manere
Wantynge of blyndnesse for hire grete light
Of sapiens and for hir þewes clere
Oþer elles þis maydenes name bright
Of heuen and leos comeþ for which by right

Ensample of goode and wise werkes alle
  
ffor leos poeple in englissch is to say
And right as men may in þis heuene se
þe sonne and moone and þe sterres euery way
Right so gostly in þis mayden fre
Seyen þe feiþ of magnificence
And ekyng of helþe and of sapience  
And sondry werkes bright of excellence 
And right as þis philosophres wryte
That heuen is swyft round and brynnyng
Right so was faire Cecile þe whyte
fful swift and besy euer in good werkyng
And round and hool in good perseueryng
And brenne euere in charite lighte 
Now haue I declared ȝou what sche highte
This mayden bright Cecile as hire lyf saiþ
Was comen of Romayns and of noble kynde
And so forþ fostred vp in þe faiþ
Of crist and bar his gospel in hire mynde
Sche neuer cessede as I writen fynde
Of hire prayere and god to loue and drede
Besechinge him to kepe hire maydenhede 
And what þis mayden schulde vnto a man
ywedded be þat was ful ȝong of age
Which þat ycleped was valerian
And þe day was comen of hire mariage
Sche fil deuoute and humble in hire corage
Vnder hire robe of gold þat sat ful faire
And next hire fleissh sche clad hire in an haire
  
And whiles þe Orgles maden melodye
To god allone þus in herte sang sche
O lord my soule and eek my body gye
Vnwemmed lest þat I confoundid be
And for his loue þat deyde vpon a tre
Euery secounde or þridde day sche faste
Ay byddyng in hire orisons ful faste
The night com and to bedde sche moste gon
Wiþ hire housbonde as often is þe manere
And pryuely sche sayde to him anon
O swete and wel biloued spouse dere
Ther is a counseil and ȝe wolde it here 
Which þat right fayn I wol vnto ȝou sayn
So þat ȝe me assure it nought to bewrayn  
Valerian gan faste  vnto hire swere
That for no cas ne þing þat mighte be

And þanne at erst þus to him sayde sche
I haue an aungel which þat loueþ me
That wiþ gret loue wheþer so I wake or slepe
Is redy ay my body for to kepe
And if þat he may felen out of drede

and if that ye  in clene loue me guye
he wolde ȝou loue as me for ȝour clennesse
And schewe ȝou of his ioye and his brightnesse
  
valerian corrected as god wolde
Answerde aȝein if I schal truste to þe 
let me þat aungel see and him biholde
And if þat it a verray aungel be
Thanne wol I don as þou hast preyed me
And if þou loue anoþer man for soþe 
Right wiþ þis swerd I wol sle ȝou boþe
Cecily answerde anon in þis wise
If þat ȝou luste þat aungel schul ȝe se
So þat ȝe trowe on crist and ȝou baptise
Goþ forþ to via apia quod sche
þat from þis toun ne stant by myles þre 
And to þe pouere folkes þat þere dwelle 
Sey hem right þus as þat I schal ȝou telle 
Telle hem þat I Cecile ȝou to hem sent
To schewen ȝou þe goode vrban þe olde
ffor secre needes and fro good entent
And whan þat ȝe seint vrban han byholde 
Telle him þe wordes whiche þat I ȝou tolde 
And whan þat he haþ purged ȝou from synne
þanne schal ȝe see þat aungel er ȝe twynne
Valerian is to þat place ygon
And right as him was taught by his lernyng
he fond þis holy Vrban þer anon
Among þese seyntes buriels lotying
And he anon wiþoute tarying  
Dide his message and whan he hadde tolde
Vrban for ioye gan his handes vpholde
  
The teeres from his eyhen leet he falle 
Almighty god O Ihesu crist quod he
Sowere of chaste counseille and herde of vs alle
þe fruyt of þilke seed of chastite 
þat þou hast sowe in Cecile tak to þe
Lo ylike a busy bee wiþoute gyle
The serueþ ay þin oughne þralle Cecile
 ffor þilke spouse þat sche tok but now 
fful like a fiers leon sche sendeþ heere 
As meke as eny lambe was to ȝow 
And wiþ þat word anon þer gan apeere 
An olde man clad wiþ white cloþes cleere
And hadde a book wiþ lettres of gold in honde
And gan biforn Valerian to stonde
Valerian as deed fel doun for drede
Whan he him saugh and him vp hente þo
And on his book right þus he gan to rede 
O lord o feiþ o god wiþoute mo
Of cristendom and fader of al also
Abouen alle and ouer alle euery where
This wordes alle with golde writen were 
Whan þis was rad þan sayde þis olde man
leeuest þou þis þing or no sey ȝe or nay
I leeue alle þis þing þan þis 
for sother thing than this 
Vnder þe heuene no wight ne þenke may
þo vanyssched þe olde man he nyste where
And pope vrban him cristned right þere
  
Valerian goþ hom and seint Cecile
Wiþinne his chambre an aungel stande
þis aungel hadde of Rose and of lylie
Corounes tuo þe which he bar in hande
And ferst to Cecile as I vnderstande 
he ȝaf þat oon and after gan he take  
þat oþer to Valerian hire make
With body clene and wiþ vnwemmyd þouȝt 
kepeþ ay wel þis corounes quod he
ffrom paradys to ȝou haue I hem brouȝt
Ne neuer more schulle þey roten be
 Ne leese here swete sauour trusteþ me
Ne neuere wight schal seen hem wiþ his yhe
But he be chaste and hate vilonye 
And þou valerian for þou so sone
Assentedest to good counseil also
Sey what þe luste and þou schalt haue þy bone 
I haue a broþer quod valerian þo
þat in þis world I loue no man so
I pray ȝou þat my broþer may han grace
To knowe þe trouþe as I do in þis 
The aungel answerde god likeþ ȝoure requeste
And boþe with þe palme of martirdome
ȝe schulle come vnto þe blisful feste
And wiþ þat word Tiburce his broþer come
And whan þat he þe sauour vndernome
Which þat þe roses and þe lylies caste 
Wiþinne his herte he gan to wondre faste 
  
And seyde in þis tyme I wondre of þe ȝeere
Whenne þis swote sauour comeþ so 
And Rosis and lilyes þat I smelle heere
ffor þough I hadde hem in myn hondes tuo
The sauour might in me no deppere go
þe swete smelle þat in myn herte I fynde
haþ chaunged me al in anoþer kinde
valerian sayde tuo corounes han we
Snow whit and Rose Reed þat schyneþ cleere
Which þat þin yhe haþ no might to see
And as þou smellest hem þorugh my preyere
So schalt þou seen hem leeue broþer deere
If it so be þat þou wolt wiþouten slouþe
Bileeue aright and knowe verray trouþe  
Tiburce answerde saist þou þis to me
In soþnesse or in drem herkne ȝe þis
In dremes quod valerian han we be
vnto þis tyme broþer myn ywys
But now at erste oure trouþe dwellyng is
how wost þou quod Tiburce and in what wyse 
Quod valerian þat I schal þe deuyse 
þe aungel of god haþ me þe trouþe ytaught
Which thou schalt seen if þat þou wolt reneye
þe ydolis and be clene and elles naught
And of þe miracles of þise corounes tweye
Seint ambrose in his preface lust to seye
Solempnely þis noble doctor deere
Comendiþ it and saiþ in þis maneere
  
The palme of martirdom for to receyue
Seint Cecile fulfilde of goddes ȝifte
þe worlde and eek hire chambre gan sche weyue
Witnesse Tiburce and Cecyles schrifte
To which god of his bounte wolde schifte
Corounes two of floures wel smellynge 
And made þe aungel hem þo corounes brynge
 þe mayde haþ brought þise men to blisse aboue
The world haþ wist what it is worþ certeyn
Deuocion of chastite to loue
þo schewed him Cecile open and pleyn
That alle ydolis nys but þing in veyn
ffor þey ben dombe and þerto þey ben deue
And charged him his ydolis for to leue
 Who þat þis troweþ not a beste he is 
Quod þo Tiburce if þat I schal not lye
Sche gan þanne kisse his breste and þat herde þis
And was ful glad he couþe trouþe aspye
This day take þe for myn allye
Seyde þis blisful mayde fair and deere
ffor after þat sche sayde as ȝe may heere
Lo right so þe loue of crist quod sche  
made me þin broþeres wyf right in þat wyse
Anoon for myn allye here take I þe
Siþenes þat þou wolt þine ydolis despise
Go with þy broþer now and þe baptise 
And make þe clene so þat þou mayst beholde
þe aungels face of which þy broþer tolde
  
Tiburce answerde and seyde broþer deere
fferst telle me whider I schal and to what man
To whom quod he com forþ with right good cheere
I wol þe lede vnto þe pope vrban
To Vrban broþer myn Valerian
Quoþ þo Tiburce wilt þou me þider lede
Me þinkeþ þat it were a wonder dede
 Remenest þou nouȝt vrban quod he þo
That is so ofte dampned to be deed
And woneþ in halkes to and fro 
And dar nouȝt ones putte forþ his heed
Men schulle him brenne in a fir so reed
If þat he were founde if þat men might him spye
And we also þat bere him companye
And whiles we seken þilke diuinyte
þat is yhyd in heuene priuely
Algate ybrent in þis world schul we be
To whom Cecile answerde bodyly
Men mighte drede wel and skilfully
þis lyf to lese myn owne deere broþer
yif þis were lyuynge oonly and non oþer
But þer is bettere lyf in oþer place
þat neuer schal be lost ne drede þe nought
Which goddes sone vs tolde þorugh his grace

and al that wrought is  with a skilful thought
the goost that from the fader  gan procede
hath souled hem  withouten eny drede
  
 By worde and bi myracle  godis sone
whan he was in this world  declared here
that ther was other liff  there men may wone
to whom answerde Tyburce  O suster dere
ne seidist thow right now  in this manere
ther nas but O god  lord in sothfastnesse
and now of thre  how maist thow bere witnesse
 That shal I telle quod she or that I go
Right as a man haþ sapiences þre 
Memorie Ingenie and Intellecte also
So in o beynge of diuynite 
Thre persones right wel þer may be
Tho gan sche him besyliche preche 
Of cristes come and of his peynes teche  
And many poyntes of his passion
how goddes sone in þis world was wiþholde
To do mankynde pleyn remission
That was ybounde in synne and cares colde
Al þis þing sche vnto Tiburce tolde
And after þis Tiburce in good entent
To pope vrban wiþ Valerian he went
which þanked god and wiþ glad herte and light
he cristned him and made him in þat place
Parfyt in his lyuynge goddes knight
And after þis Tiburce gat such grace
þat euery day he seyh in tyme and space
þe aungel of god and euery maner bone
þat he god asked it was sped ful sone
  
 It were ful hard by ordre for to seyn
how many wondres ihesu for him wrouȝt
But atte laste to telle schort and pleyn
þe sergeaunt of þe toun of Rome hem sought
And hem byforn Almache þe prouost brought
Which hem opposede and knew al here entent
And to þe ymage of Iubiter he hem sent 
And sayde who so wol not Sacrifise
Swap of his heed þis is my sentence heere 
Anon þise martires þat I ȝou deuyse 
On Maximius þat was an officere 
Of þe Prefectis and of Corniculere
hem hente and when he forþ þe seintes ledde
himself he weep for pite þat he hadde
 Whan maximine hadde herde þe seintes lore 
he gat hem of þe tormentoures leue 
And hadde hem in his hous wiþoute more
And wiþ here prechyng er þat it were eue
þey gonne from þe tormentours to reue 
And from Maximius and from his folk ilkon
þe false feiþ to trowe in god allon
Cecile cam whan it was woxen night  
Wiþ prestes þat hem cristned alle in feere
And aftirward whan day was waxen light
Cecile hem sayde wiþ a sobre chere
Now cristes owne knightes leeue and deere
Casteþ alle a wey þe werkes of derknesse 
And armeþ ȝou in armure of lightnesse
  
ȝe han forsoþe ydon grete bataille
ȝoure is doon ȝoure feiþ han ȝe conserued
Goþ to þe coroune of lyf þat may nouȝt faille
þe rightful Iuge which þat ȝe han 
shal yeue hit yow  as ye han it
And whan þis þing was sayd as I deuyse
men ladde hem forth to don þe sacrifise 
But whan þey were vnto þe place ybrouȝt 
To telle schortly þe conclusion
þey nolde encense no sacrifice right nouȝt
But on here knees þey setten hem adoun
Wiþ humble herte and sad deuocion
And losten boþe here hedes in þe place
here soules wenten to þe kyng of grace
This maximius þat say þis þing betyde 
Wiþ pitous tales tolde it anon right
þat he here soules saugh to heuen glyde
With aungels ful of clernes and of light
And wiþ his word conuerted many a wight
ffor which Almachus dede him so to bete
Wiþ whippe of leed til he his lyf gan lete 
Cecile him took and buried him anon
By Tyburce and Valerian softely
Wiþinne hire heryinge place vnder þe ston
And after þis Almachius hastily
Bad his mynistres fecchen openly
Cecile so sche mighte in his presence
Do sacrifice and Iubiter encense
  
But þey conuertid þorugh hire wise lore
Wepten sore and ȝauen credence 
Vnto hire word and cryden more and more  
Crist goddes sone wiþouten difference
his verray god þis is alle oure sentence

þus wiþ oo vois we trowe þeyȝ we sterue
Almachius þat herde al þis speking
Bad fecche Cecile þat he might hir se
And alþer first lo þis was his askyng
What maner womman artow þo quod he 
I am a gentil womman born quod sche 
I aske quod he þouȝ it þe greue
Of þin religion and of þin byleeue
Whi þanne bygan ȝoure question folily
Quod sche þat woldest tuo answers conclude 
In oo demaunde ȝe askide lewedly
Almachie answerde to þat similitude 

Of whennes quod sche whan þat sche was refreyned
Of conscience and of good feiþ vnfeyned
Almachius sayde takest þou non heede 
Of þin answere and sche him answerde þus

ffor euery mortel mannes power nys
But ylike a bladdre ful of wynd ywys

And ȝit in wrong is þin perseuerance
Wost þou nouȝt how oure mighty princes fre
Ben þus comaundid and maken ordinannce
That euery cristne wight schal han penannce
But if þat he his cristendom wiþseye
And gon al quyt if he wol it receyue
 Ȝoure princes erren as ȝoure noblen doth
Quod þo Cecile  and a wood sentence

To crist and for we bere a cristene name
ȝe putte on vs a cryme and eek a blame
But we þat knowen þilke name so
ffor vertuous we may it not say
Almachie answerde chese on of þise tuo
Do sacrifice or cristendom reneyne

At which þe holy blisful mayde
gan for to laughe and to þe Iuge sche sayde
O Iuge confuse in þy nycete
Wolt þou þat I reneye Innocence 
To make me a wicked wight quod sche

To whom almachius O Vnseely wrecche 
Ne wost þou nought how fer my might may strecche
  
haþ nought oure mighty prince to me yȝouen
ȝe boþe power and auctorite 
To make folk to deyen and to lyuen
Why spekest þou so proudly þenne to me
I ne speke it nouȝt but stedefastly quod sche 
Nought proudly for I say as for my syde
I hate dedly þilke vice of pryde
 And if þou drede nouȝt a soþ to heere
þan wol I schewen al openly by right
That þou hast maad a ful gret lesyng heere
þou sayst þy princes han ȝeue þe might
Boþe to sleen and eek for to quike a wight

But þou mayst see þin princes han þe maked
Ministre of deþ for if þou speke of mo

Do wey þy boldenesse seyde almachius þo
And sacrifice to oure goddes or two  
I ne recche nouȝt what wrang þat þou me profre
ffor I can suffre it as a philosophre
But þilke wronges may I nought endure
þat þou spekest of oure goddes here quod he 
Cecile answerde O nyce creature
þou saydest no word syns þou speeke to me

And þat þou were in euery maner wyse 
A lewed officer and a vein Iustise
  
þer lackeþ noþing to þin vtter yhen

That is a ston yt men wel may aspyen
That ilke ston a god þou wilt it calle
I rede þe let þin hond vpon it falle
And taste it wel and stoon þou schalt it fynde 
Syns þat þou sixt it nought wiþ þin yȝen blynde 
It is a schame þat þe poeple schall
So skorne þe and lawhe at þy folye 
ffor comunely wommen woot it wel ouer al

And þese ymages wel þanne mayst þou aspye
To þe ne to hemself may þey not profyte
ffor in here effecte þey be not worþ a myte
þis and such oþer wordes seyde sche 
and he wax wroþ and bad þey schulde hire lede 
home to hire hous and in hire hous quod he
Brenne hire in a fire wiþ flammes reede
And as he bad right so was don in dede
And in a bathe þey gan hire faste scheten
And night and day gret fuyr vnder þey beetyn
Al þe longe night and eek þe day also 
ffor alle þe fuyr and eek þe baþes hete 
Sche satte al colde and felt of it no wo
Ne made hire a drop nouȝt for to swete 
But in þat baþe hire lyf sche moste lete 
ffor he Almachie wiþ ful wikked entent  
To slen hure in þe bath his sonde sent
  
þre strokes in þe necke he smot hire þo
The tormentour but for no maner chaunce
he might not smyten al hire necke a tuo
And for þer was þat tyme an ordynaunce
That no man scholde do man such penance
þe ferþe strook to smyten softe or sore
þis tormentour ne durste nomore
But half ded wiþ hire necke koruen þere 
he laft hir lye and in his wey he went
þe cristne folke whiche abouten hire were 
Wiþ scheetes home ful faire hire hent
þre dayes lyued sche in þis torment
And neuer cessed hem þe feiþ to teche
þat sche hadde fostred hem sche gan to preche
And hem sche ȝaff hire moebles and hire þing
And to þe pope vrban bitok hem þo 
And sayde þus I askede þis of heuen king
To haue respyt þre dayes and no mo 
To recomande to ȝou er þat I go
þise soules lo and þat I mighte do wirche
here of myn hous perpetuelliche a chirche
Seint vrban wiþ his deaknes priuely
The body fette and buried it by nighte
Among his oþere seintes honestely
hire hous þe chirche of seint Cecile highte
Seynt vrban halwed it as he wel mighte
In þe which in to þis day in noble wyse 
Men don to cryst and to his seintz seruise
Whan ended was þe lyf of seint Cecile
Er we fully hadde ryden fyue myle
At Boghton vnder þe blee vs gan atake 
A man þat cloþed was in cloþes blake
And vnder þat he hadde a whit surplys
his hakeney þat was al pomel grys  
So swette þat it wonder was to see
It semed he hadde priked myles þre
þe hors eek þat his ȝoman rood vpon
So swette þat vnneþe mighte he gon
Aboute þe peytrel stood þe foom ful hiȝe
he was of fome al flekked as a pye
A male twyfold on his croper lay
It semed þat he caryed lytel aray
Al light for somer rood þis worþy man
And in myn herte wondren I bygan
What þat he was til þat I vnderstood
how þat his cloke was sewed to his hood
ffor which whan I longe hadde avised me 
I demed him som chanon for to be 
his hat hyng at his bak doun by a las 
ffor he hadde ryde more þan trot or pas 
he hadde ay priked lyk as he were wood
A clote leef he hadde vnder his hood
ffor swot and for to kepe his heed from hete
But it was ioye for to seen him swete 
his forhed dropped as a stillatorie
Were ful of plaunteyne and of peritorie
  
And whan þat he cam he bigan to crye
God saue quod he þis Ioly companye
ffaste haue I priked quod he for ȝoure sake
By cause þat I wolde ȝou ouertake 
To ryden in þis merye companye
His ȝoman eek was ful of curtesye
And sires now in þe morwe tyde 
Out of ȝoure ostellerye I sayȝ ȝou ryde
And warned heer my lord and my souerayn
Which þat to ryde wiþ ȝou is ful fayn
ffor his disport he loueþ daliaunce
ffrend for þy warnyng god ȝiue þe good chaunce
Sayde oure oost certes it wolde seeme 
Thy lord were wys and so I may wel deme   
he is ful iocunde also dar I lay
Kan he ought telle a merye tale or tway
Wiþ which he glade may þis companye
Who sire my lord ȝe ȝe wiþoute lye
he can of merþe and eek of Iolite
Nought but ynough also sire trusteþ to me
And ȝe him knewe als wel as do I
ȝe wolde wondre how wel and þriftyly
he couþe werke and þat in sondry wyse
he haþ take on him many sondry aprise
Which were ful hard for eny þat is heere 
To bringe aboute but þey of him it lere 
As homely as he ryt amonges ȝou
If ȝe him knewe it wolde be ȝoure prow 
ȝe nolde not forgon his aqueintance
ffor mochil good I dar leye in balance
Al þat I haue my possession
he is a man of heigh discrecion
I warne ȝou wel he is a passynge man
Wel quoþ oure host I pray þe telle me þan
Is he a Clerk or noon telle what he is
Nay he is gretter þan a clerk ywys
  
Seyde ȝe ȝoman and in wordes fewe
Ost and of his craft somwhat I wol ȝou schewe
I say my lord can such a sotilte
But alle his crafte ȝe may not wite at me
And somwhat helpe I ȝit to his worchinge
That al þis ground which þat we ben on rydynge
Til þat we come to Caunturbury toun
he couþe al clene turne it vp se doun
And paue it al of siluer and of gold
And whan þis ȝoman hadde þus ytold
vnto oure hoost  he seyde benedicite
þis þing is wonder merueylous to me
Siþens þat þi lord is of so heigh prudence 
By cause of which men scholde him reuerence   
That of his worschipe rekkeþ he so lyte
his ouer sloppe  nys nouȝt worþ a myte 
As in effecte to him so mote I go
It is al baudy and totore also
Whi is þi lord so sluttissche I þe prey
And is of power better cloþes to bey
If þat his dede acorde wiþ þy speche
Telle me þat and þat I þe byseche 
Why quod þis ȝeman wherto aske ȝe me 
God help me so for he schal neuer ythe
But I wol not avowe þat I say
And þerfore kepe it secre I ȝou pray
he is to wys in faiþ as I bileeue
And þat is ouer doon it nyl not preue
And right as clerkes sein it is a vice 
Wherfore in þat I holde him lewed and nyce
ffor whan a ma haþ ouer gret a witt
fful often it happeþ to mysvsen it
So doþ my lord and þat me greueþ sore
God it amende I can seye now no more
Therof no fors goode ȝoman quod oure hoost
Siþens of þe connyng of þy lord þou woost
  
Telle how he doþ I pray þe hertely
Siþens þat he is so crafty and so sly
Wher dwellen ȝe if to telle be
In Subarbes of a toun quod he
lurkyng in hernes and in lanes blynde
Where þise Robbers and þeeues be kynde
holden here preuy ferful resydence
As þay þat dur nat schewe here presence
So fare we if I schal saye þe soþe
ȝit quod oure hoste lat me talke toþe
Why art þou discoloured on þy face
Peter quod he god ȝiue hit harde grace
I am so vsed in þe fyre to blowe
That it haþ chaunged my colour as I trowe  
I nam nat wont in myrour to prye
But swynke sore and lerne to multiplye
We bloundren euer and pouren in þe fyr
And for al þat we faillen of oure desir
ffor euer we lacken oure conclusion
To moche folk we ben but Illusion
And borwe gold be it a pound or tuo
Or ten or twelue or manye sommes mo
And make hem wenen atte leste weye
þat of a pound we couþe make tweye
ȝit is it fals and ay we han good hope
It for to don and after it we grope
But þat science is so fer vs biforn
We mowe not al þough we hadde it sworn
It ouertake it slyt awey so faste
It wole us make beggeres atte laste
Whil þis ȝoman was þus in þis talking
þis chanon drough him ner and herde alle þing
Which þat þis ȝoman spak for suspecion
Of mennes speche euere hadde þis Chanon
ffor Caton seith he þat gulty is
Demeþ alle þing be spoke of him ywys
  
By cause of þat he gan so neigh to drawe 
his ȝoman þat he herde alle his sawe 
And þus he sayde vnto his ȝoman þo
holde now þy pees and speke wordes no mo 
ffor if þou dost þou schalt it dere abye
Thou sclaundrest me here in þis compaignye
And eek discouerest þat þou scholdest hyde
ȝee quod oure hoost telle on what so betyde
Of alle þis þretyng recche I nat a myte
I faiþ quod he no more do I but a lite
And whan þis Chanon say it wolde nat be
But his ȝoman wolde telle his priuyte
he fledde away for verray sorwe and schame 
A quod þe ȝoman here schal aryse a game  
Al þat I can anon right wol I telle
Siþens he is gon þe foule feend him quelle 
ffor neuer her after wol I wiþ him mete
ffor peny ne for pound I ȝou biheete 
he þat me broughte ferst vnto þat game 
Er þat he deye sorwe haue he and schame
ffor it is ernest to me by my fayþ
That feele I wel what so eny man saiþ 
And ȝit for al my smert and al my greef
ffor al my sorwe labour and mescheef
I couþe neuer leue it in no wyse
Now wolde god my witt mighte suffise
To tellen al þat longeþ to þat art
But naþeles ȝit wol I telle a part
Syþens þat my lord is gon I wol not spare
Such þing as I knowe I wol declare 
With þis chanon dwelled haue I seuen ȝeer
And of his science am I neuer þe neer
Al þat I hadde I haue ylost þerby
And god wot so haue many mo þan I
þer I was wont to be right freissch and gay
Of cloþing and of good array
Now may I were an hose vpon myn heed
And wher my colour was boþe freissh and reed
Now is it wan and of a ledene hewe
Who so it vseth sore schal he rewe
And of my swynk ȝit blered is myn yȝe
lo which auauntage it is to multiplye
That slydynge science haþ me maad so bare
That I haue no good where þat euer I fare
And ȝit I am endetted so þer by
Of gold þat I haue borwed trewely
þat whil I lyue I schal it quite neuere 
lat euery man be war by me for euere
What maner man þat casteþ him þerto
If he continue I holde his þrifte ydo  
So help me god þerby schal he not wynne
But empte his purs and make his wittes þinne
And whan he þorugh his madnesse and folye
haþ lost his owne good þorugh Iepardye
þanne he exciteþ oþer men þerto
To lese here good as himself haþ do
ffor vnto schrewes Ioye it is and ese
To haue here felawes in peyne and disese
  
Thus was I ones lerned of a clerk
Of þat no charge I wol speke of oure werk
Whan we ben þere as we schulle exercise
Oure eluysshe craft we semen wonder wise
Oure termes ben so clergeal and so queynte
I blowe þe fuyr til þat myn herte feynte
What scholde I telle eche proporcion
Of þinges whiche þat we worchen vppon
As on fyue or sixe vnces may wel be
Of siluer or of som oþer quantite
And besye me to telle ȝou þe names
Of Opyment brent bones yren squames
That in to poudre grounden ben ful smal
And in an erþen pot how þat put is al
And salt yput in and also paupere
Bifore þise poudres þat I speke of here
And wel ycouered wiþ a laumpe of glas
And of muche oþer þing what þat þer was
And of þe pot and glas englutyng
That of þe aier mighte passe no þing
And of þe esy fyr and smert also
Which þat was mad and of þe care and wo

And amalgamynge and Calcenynge
Of quyk syluer ycleped mercurie crude
ffor alle oure sleightes we can nouȝt conclude
Oure orpymed and sublimed mercurie
Oure grounde litarge eek on þe porphirie  
Of ech of þise of vnces a certayn
Nouȝt helpeþ vs oure labour is in vain
Ne eek oure spirites ascencioun
Ne eek oure matieres þat lyn al fixe a doun
Mowen in oure werkynge no þing vs auayle
ffor lost is alle oure labour and trauaile
And al þe cost on twenty deuele wey
Is lost also which we vpon it ley
  
þer is also many anoþer þing

þough I by ordre hem here ne reherse can
By cause þat I am a lewed man
ȝit wol I telle hem as þey come to mynde
Though I ne kan nat sette hem in here kynde
As boole armonyak verdegres Boras
And sondry vesseles made of erþe and glas

By ordre ofte as I herde my lord neuene
The fyfte spirit quyk siluer called is

Mars yren mercurie quyk syluer we clepe

This cursede craft who so wol exercise
he schal no good han þat may him suffise
ffor alle þe good he spendeþ þer aboute
he lese schal þerof haue I no doute
Who so þat list to outen his folye
let him come forþ and lerne to multiplie
And euery man þat haþ aught in his cofre
lat him appere and wexe a philosophre
Asscaunce þat craft is so light for to lere
Nay nay god woot al be he monk or frere 
Preste or Chanon or eny oþer wight
þough he sitte at his book boþe day and night
In lernyng of þis eluyssh nyce lore 
Al is in veyn and par de moche more
Is to lerne a lewed man þis sotilte

Al cowde he letterure or couþe he non

Of watres corosif and of lymaille

Oyles ablucion and metalle fusible
To tellen alle wolde passen ony bible

Of alle þise names now wole I me reste

To reysen a feende loke he neuer so rough
A nay let be þy philosophres ston
Elixir cleped we sechen faste echoon
ffor hadde we him þan were we syker ynough
But vnto god of heuene I make avow
ffor alle oure craft whan we han al ydo
And al oure sleighte  he wol not come vs to
He haþ vs maad spende moche good
ffor sorwe of which almost we wexen wood
But þat good hope crepeþ in oure herte
Supposyng euere þough we sore smerte
To be releuyd by him aftirward
Supposyng and hope is scharp and hard
I warne ȝou wel it is to seken euere

In trust þerof fram al þat euer þey hadde
ȝit of þat art þey couþe not wexe sadde
ffor vnto hem it is a bitterswete
So semeþ it for ne hadde þey but a scheete
Which þat þey mighte wrappe hem In a night
And a bak to walken in by day light
þey wolde hem sellen and spenden on þis craft
They can nouȝt stynte til no þing be laft  
And euermore wher þat euer þey gon
men may hem knowe by smel of Bremston
ffor al þe world þey stynken as a goot
here sauour is so Rammissh and so hoot
That þough a man from hem a myle be
That sauour wol enfecte him trusteþ me
lo þus by smellyng and by þred bare array
If þat men list þis folk þey knowe may
  
And if a man wol aske him priuely
Why þey ben cloþed so vnþriftily
Right anon þey wole rownen in his eere
And seye if þay aspyed were
Men wolde hem sle by cause of here science
lo þus þis folk bytrayen Innocence
Passe ouer þis I go my tale vnto
Er þen þe pot be on þe fyr ydo
Of metals wiþ a certein quantite
My lord hem tempreþ and no man but he
Now he is gon I dar say boldely
ffor as men sein he can do craftily
Algate I wot wel he haþ such a name
And ȝit ful ofte he renneþ in þe blame
And wite ȝe how ful ofte it happeþ so
The pot tobrekeþ and far wel alle is go
þise metals ben of so gret violence 
Oure walles may not make hem resistence
But if þey were wrouȝt of lym and ston
þey percen so and þoruȝ þe wal þey gon
And some of hem synken in to þe ground
þus haue we lost by tymes many a pound
And somme are scatered al þe floor aboute
Somme lepen in to þe roof wiþouten doute
þough þat þe fende nought in oure sighte him schewe
I trowe þat he wiþ vs be þat schrewe
In helle wher þat he is lord and sire 
Ne is þer no more woo ne angur nor Ire  
Whan þat oure pot is broke as I haue sayd
Euery man chit and halt him yuel payd
Som seyde it was long on þe fyr makyng
Somme sayde nay it was on þe blowyng
þan was I fered for þat was myn office
Straw quod þe þridde ȝe ben lewed and nyce
It was not tempred as it oughte be 
Nay quod þe ferþe stynt and herkne me
  
By cause oure fyr was nat made of bech
þat is þe cause non oþer so peech
I can not telle wheron it is a long
But wel I wot gret stryf is vs among
What quod my lord þer is nomore to done 
Of þise periles I wil be war eft sone 
I am right syker þat þe pot was crased
Be as be may be ȝe no þing amased
As vsage is let swope þe floor as swyþe
Pluk vp ȝour herte and be ȝe glad and bliþe
The mullok on an heep yswoped was
And on þe floor cast a kaneuas
And al þis mullok in a Syue yþrowe
And ysifted and yplucked many a þrowe
Parde quod oon som what of oure metal
ȝet is þer heere þough we haue not all
And þough þis þing myshapped haþ as now
Anoþer tyme it may be wel ynow
vs moste putte oure good in aduenture 
A marchant parde may not ay endure 
Trustneþ me wel in his prosperite
Som tyme his good is drowned in þe see 
And som tyme comeþ it sauf vnto þe londe
Pees quod my lord þe nexte tyme I wol fonde
To bringe oure crafte alle in anoþer plyt
And but I do sires lat me haue þe wyte
Ther was defaute in somwhat wel I woot
Anoþer seyde þe fyr was ouer hoot  
But be it hoot or cold I dar seye þis
þat we concluden eueremore amys 
We faille of þat which þat we wolde haue 
And in oure madnesse eueremore we raue
And whan we ben togidere euerich on
Euery man semeþ as wys as Salomon
But alle þing which þat semeþ as þe goolde 
Is nat golde as I haue herd it tolde 
  
Ne euery appul þat is fair at ye
Ne is not good what so men clappe or crye 
Right so lo fareþ it amonges vs
he þat semeþ þe wysest by Ihesus
Is most fool whan it comeþ to þe preef
And he þat semeþ trewest is a þeef
That schul ȝe knowe er þat I fro ȝou wende 
By þat I of my tale haue maad an ende
Ther is a chanoun of Religioun
Amonges vs wolde enfecte al a toun
þough it as gret were as was Nynyue 
Rome Alisandre  Troye and oþre þre
his sleightes and his infinite falsnesse 
þer couþe noman writen as I gesse 
þough þat he mighte lyuen a þousend ȝeer
In alle þis world of falnesse nys his peer
ffor in his termes he wole him so wynde
And speke his wordes in so sleigh a kynde
Whan he commune schal wiþ ony wight
What he wol make him dote anon right
But it þe feend be as his seluen is 
fful many a man haþ he begyled er þis
And wile if þat he may lyue a while 
And ȝit men ryden and gon ful many a myle
him for to seeke and haue his aqueyntance
Nouȝt knowyng of his false gouernance 
And if ye lust to ȝiue me audience
I wol it tellen here in ȝoure presence  
But worschipful Chanon religious
Ne demeþ nouȝt þat I sclaundre ȝour hous
Al þough my tale of a Chanon be
Of euery ordre som schrewe is parde
And god forbede þat alle a compaignie
Scholde rewe a synguler mannes folye
To sclaundre ȝou it is not myn entent
But to correcten þat mys Iment
  
This tale nas nat oonly told for ȝou
But eek for oþer mo ȝe wot wel how
That amonges cristes apostles twelue
Ther was no traytour but Iudas himselue
þanne why scholde þe remenant alle haue blame
That gulteles were by ȝou sey I þe same
Sauf oonly þis if ȝe wiln herkne me
If ony Iudas in ȝoure couent be
Remeueþ him by tyme I ȝou rede
If schame or losse may causen ony drede
And beþ no þing displesed I ȝou pray
But in þis caas herkneth what I say
IN london was a prest an annueler
That þerInne dwelled hadde many a ȝeer
Which was so plesant  and so seruisable 
Vnto þe wyf wher he was at þe table
That sche wolde suffre him no þing for to pay
ffor bord nor cloþing wente he non so gay
And spendyng siluer had he right ynough
þerof no force I wol procede as now 
And telle forþ my tale of þe Chanon
þat brouȝte þis prest to confusion
This false Chanon cam vpon a day
vnto þe prestes chambre þer he lay
Byseching him to lene him a certeyn
Of golde and he wold quite it him ageyn
leneþ me a mark quod he but dayes þre
And at my day I wol it quite þe  
And if so be þat þou fynde me fals
Anoþer day hang me vp by þe hals
This prest him tok a mark and þat as swiþe
And þis Chanoun him þanked often siþe
And took his leue and wente forth his wey
And atte þridde day brouȝt his money
And to þis prest he took þis gold aȝein
Therof þis prest was glad and fayn
  
Certes quod he no þing anoyeth me
To lene a man a noble or tuo or þre
Or what þing were in my possession
Whan he so trewe is of condicion
þat in no wise he breke wole his day
To swich a man I can neuer say nay
What quod þis Chanon scholde I be vntrewe
Nay þat were þing fallen al of þe newe
Trouþe is a þing þat I wol euer kepe 
Vnto þe day in which þat I schal crepe
in to my graue and elles god forbede
Bileeueþ þis as siker as is ȝoure Crede
God þanke I and in good tyme be it sayd
þat þer was neuer man ȝit euel payd
ffor gold ne siluer þat he to me lente
Ne neuere falshede in myn herte I mente
And sire quod he now of my priuyte
Siþens ȝe so goodlich haue ben to me
And kiþed to me so gret gentilnesse
Somwhat to quite with ȝoure kyndenesse
I wol ȝou schewe and if ȝou lest to leere 
I schal it schewe to ȝou anon right heere
how I kan worchen in philosophie
Takeþ good heed ȝe schuln seen wel at ye
That I wol don a maystry ar I go
ȝe quoþ þe prest  ȝe sire and wil ȝe so
Marie þer of I pray ȝou hertily
At ȝoure comaundement sire trewely  
Quoþ þe Chanon and elles god forbede
lo how þis þeef couþe his seruise beede
fful soþ it is þat such profred seruise
Stynkeþ as witnessen þise olde wise
And þat ful sone I wol it verefye
In þis Chanon is roote of alle treccherie
þat eueremore delyt haþ and gladnesse
Suche feendly þoughtes in his herte impresse 
  
how cristes poeple he may to meschief bringe
God kepe vs from his fals dissimilynge
What wiste þis prest wiþ whom þat he delte
Ne of his harm comynge no þing he felte
O sely prest o sely Innocent
Wiþ coueytise anon þou schalt be blent
O graceles ful blynd is þy conceyt
No þing artow war of þe deceyt
Which þat þis fox yschapen haþ to þe
his wyly wrenches þou mayst nouȝt fle
Wherfore to go to þe conclusion
þat referreþ to þi confusion
vnhappy man anon I wol me hiȝe
To telle þin vnwitte and þy folye
And eek þe falsnesse of þat oþer wrecche
As ferforþ as my connynge wol strecche
This Chanon was my lord ȝe wolde weene
Sire oste in faith and by þe heuen quene
It was anoþer chanoun and nat he
That can an hundred fold more sotyltee
he haþ bytrayed folkes many tyme
Of his falsnesse it dulleþ me to Ryme
Euer whan I speke of his falshede
ffor schame of him my chekes wexen reede
Algates þey bygynne for to glowe
ffor reednesse haue I now right wel I knowe
In my visage for fumes diuerse
Of metals whiche ȝe haue herd me reherce  
Consumed and wasted han my reednesse 
Now take heede of þis Chanons cursednesse
Sire quod he to þe prest lat ȝoure man gon
ffor quyk siluer þat we it hadde anon
And lat him bringe vnces tuo or þre
And whan he comeþ as faste schul ȝe see
A wonder þing which ȝe say neuer ar þis
Sire quod þe prest it schal ben don ywys
  
he bad his seruant fechen him his þing
And he al redy was at his biddyng
And wente him forþ and cam anon agayn
Wiþ þis quyk siluer schortly for to sayn
And tok þis vnces þre to þe Chanon
And he it leyde faire and wel a doun
And bad þe seruant coles for to bringe
þat he anon mighte go to his worchinge
The coles right anon weren yfette
And þis chanon tok out a crosselette
Of his bosom and schewed it þe prest
This Instrument quod he which þat þou seest
Tak in þin hond and put þiself þer Inne
Of þis quyk siluer an vnce and here bygynne
In þe name of crist to wexe a Philosophre
Ther ben ful fewe which þat I wolde profre
To schewen hem þus mochel of my science
ffor ȝe schuln seen heere by experience
þat þis quyk siluer I wol mortefye
Right in ȝoure sight anon wiþoute lye
And make it as good siluer and as fyn
As þer is ony in ȝoure purs or myn
Or elles where and make it malliable
And elles holde me fals and vnable
Amonges folk euere to appere
I haue a poudre here þat coste me deere
schal make al good for it is cause of all
My connynge which þat I ȝou schewe schall  
Voydeth ȝoure man and lat him be þeroute 
And schitte þe dore whiles we ben aboute 
Oure pryuyte þat noman vs espie
Whiles we werken in þis philosophie 
Al as he bad fulfilled was in dede 
This ilke seruant anon right out ȝede
And his maistrer schitte þe dore anon
And to here labour speedily þey gon
  
This prest at þis cursed chanōns byddyng
Vpon þe fire anon sette þis þing
And blew þe fyr and busyed him ful faste
And þis chanon in to þis Crosselet caste
A poudre not I wherof þat it was
Imaad oþer of chalk oþer of glas
Or som what elles was not worþ a flye
To blynde wiþ þis prest and bad him hye
þise coles for to couchen al aboue
þe cresselet for in tokne þat I þe loue
Quoþ þis Chanon þine hondes tuo
Schulle worche alle þing which as schal be do
Graunt mercy quod þe prest and was ful glad
And couchede coles as þe Chanon bad
And whils he besy was þis feendly wrecche
þis false Chanon þe foule feend him fecche
Out of his bosom took a bechene cole 
In which ful sotilly was maad an hole
And þer Inne put was of siluer lymaille
An vnce and stopped was wiþoute faille
This hole wiþ wex to kepe þe lymaille In
And vnderstondeþ þat þis false gyn
Was not made þere but it was maad bifore
And oþere þinges I schal telle more 
here aftirward which þat he wiþ him broughte
Er he cam þer to begyle him he þoughte
And so he dide er þey wente a twynne 
Til he hadde torned him couþe he not blynne  
It dulleþ me whan þat I of him speke
On his falshede fayn wolde I me wreke 
If I wiste how  but he is heer and þere 
he is so variaunt þat he abyt no where 
But takeþ heed now sires for goddes loue
He took his cole of which I spak aboue
And in his hond he bar it priuely
And whiles þe prest couchide busily
  
The coles as I tolde ȝou er þis 
This Chanon sayde freend ȝe don amys
This is nought couched as it oughte be
But sone I schal amenden it quod he
Now lat me medle þerwiþ but a while
ffor of ȝou haue I pite by seint Gyle
ȝe ben right hoot I se wel how ȝe swete
haue heer a cloþ and wype awey þe wete
And while þat þe prest him wyped has
This Chanon took his cole I schrewe his fas
And leyde it vppon abouen þe myddeward
Of þe Crosselet and blew wel aftirward
Til þat þe coles gonne faste brenne
Now ȝif vs drinke quod þe Chanon þenne
as swiþe it schal be wel I vndertake
Sitte we doun and let vs merie make
And whan þe Chanons bechene cole
Was brent alle þe lymail out of þe hole
In to þe Crosselet anon fel doun
And so it moste neede by reson
Syns it so euene aboue couched was
But þerof wiste no þing þe prest allas
he demed alle þe coles liche goode
ffor of þe sleight no þing he vnderstoode
And whan þis alkamistre say his tyme
Riseþ vp sire prest and stondeþ byme
And for I wot wel Ingot haue ȝe non
Goþ walkeþ forþ and bring a chalk ston  
ffor I wol make it of þe same schappe
þat is an Ingot if I may haue happe
And bring wiþ ȝou a bolle oþer a panne
fful of water and ȝe schul see þanne
How þat oure busynesse schal happe and preeue
And ȝit for ȝe schul haue no mysbyleeue
Ne wrong conceyt of me in ȝoure absence
I wol not ben out of ȝoure presence
  
But go with ȝou and come with ȝou agayn
The chambre dore schortly for to sayn
þey opeynd and schette and wente forþ here weye
And forþ wiþ hem þey caryed þe keye
And comen agayn wiþouten eny delay
What scholde I tarie al þe longe day
he took þe chalk and schoop it in þe wyse
Of an yngot as I schal ȝou deuyse
I say he took out of his owne sleeue
A teyne of Siluer euele mote he cheeue
Which þat was but an vnce of weight
And takeþ heede now of his cursed sleight
he schop his Ingot in lengþe and in brede
Of þe theyne wiþouten eny drede
So slyly þat þe prest it not aspyde
And in his sleeue again he gan it hyde
And from þe fyre took vp his matiere 
And in to þe Ingot it putte wiþ merye cheere
And in to þe watir vessel he it caste
Whan þat him liste and bad þe prest as faste
loke what þer is  put in þin hond and grope
Thou schalt fynde þere siluer as I hope
What deuyl of helle schuld it elles be
Schafyng of siluer siluer is parde
he putte in his hond and took vp a teyne
Of siluer fyn and glad in euery veyne
Was þis prest whan he saugh þat it was so
Goddes blessyng and his modres also  
And alle halwes haue ȝe sire Chanon
Seyde þe prest and I here malison
But and ȝe vouche sauf to teche me
þis noble crafte and þis sotilte
I wol be ȝoure in alle þat euer I may
Quoþ þe Chanon ȝit wol I make assay
The seconde tyme þat ȝe mowe take heede
And ben expert of þis and in ȝoure neede
  
Anoþer day in myn absence 
þis discipline and þis crafty science
 let take anoþer vnce quod he þo
Of quyk siluer wiþoute wordes mo
And do þerwiþ as ȝe han don ar þis
Wiþ þat oþer which þat now siluer is
þis prest him busieþ in al þat he can
To don as þis Chanōn þis cursede man
Comaundeþ him and faste blew þe fire
ffor to come to þeffecte of his desire
And þis Chanōn right in þe mene while
Al redy was þis prest eft to begyle
And for a contynaunce in his hond bar
An holough stikke tak heede and be war
In þe ende of which an vnce and no more
Of siluer lymaile put was al bifore
Was in his coole and stopped wiþ wex wel
ffor to kepe in his lymayl euery del
And whiles þis prest was in his businesse
This Chanon wiþ his stikke gan him dresse
To him anon and his poudre caste In
As he dede er þe deuel out of his skyn
him torne I pray to god for his falshede
ffor he was euer fals in oþe and dede
And wiþ his stikke aboue þe crosselette
þat was ordeigned wiþ þat false gette
he stereþ þe coles til it relente gan
The wax agayn þe fyr as euery man  
But it a fool be woot wel and moot neede
And al þat in þe hole was out ȝede
And in to þe Crosselet hastily it fel
The prest supposede noþing but wel
But busyed him faste and was wonder fayn
Supposyng nouȝt but trouþe soþ to sayn
he was so glad I can nouȝt expresse
In no maner his merþe and his gladnesse
  
And þe chanon he profred eft sone
Body and good ȝe quod þe Chanōn soone
þough pore I be crafty þou schalt me fynde
I warne þe ȝit is þer more behynde
Is þer eny coper here Inne seyde he
ȝe sire quod þe prest I trowe þer bee
Elles go bey som and þat as swithe
Now sire go forþ þy way and hy the
And went his way and wiþ þis coper he cam
And þis Chanōn in his hond it nam
And of þat coper weyde out but an vnce
Al to symple is my tonge to pronounce
his moustre and his wit þe doublenesse
Of þis Chanon roote of Cursednesse
he semyd freendly to hem þat knewe him nought
But he was feendly boþe in werk and þouȝt
It wyrieþ me to telle of his falsnesse
And naþeles ȝet wol I it expresse
To þat entent þat men may be war þerby
And for non oþer cause trewely
he putte þis vnce of coper in to þe Crosselette
And of þe fyur as swiþe he haþ it sette
And kast in poudre and made þe prest to blowe
And in his worching for to stoupe lowe
As he dide erst and al nas but a Iape
Right as him liste þe prest he made his ape
And afterward in to þe Ingot he it caste
And in þe panne putte it atte laste   
Of water and in he put his owne hand
And in his sleeue as ȝe byforn hand
herde me telle he hadde a siluer teyne
he slyly took it out þis cursed heyne
vnwetyng þis prest of his false craft
And in þe pannes botme he haþ it laft
And in þe water rombleþ to and fro
And wonder pryuyly tok it vp also
  
þe coper teyne nought knowyng þis prest
And hidde it and hente him by þe breest
And to him spak and þus sayde in his game
Stowpeþ a doun by god ȝe ben to blame
helpeþ me now as I dide ȝou whiler
Put in ȝoure hand and lokeþ what is þer
þis prest tok vp þis siluer teyne anon
And þanne seyde þe chanōn let vs gon
Wiþ þise þre teynes whiche þat we haue wrought
To som goldsmith and wite if it be ought
ffor by my faiþ I nolde for myn hond
But if þei were siluer fyn and good
And þat as swiþe proued schal it be
Vnto þe goldsmith wiþ þise teynes þre
þey wente and putte þise teynes in assay
To fyr and hamer might no man say nay
But þey were as hem ouȝte for to be
þis sottide prest who was gladder þan he
Was neuer bryd gladder aȝeins þe day
Ne nightyngale in þe seson of May
Was neuere non þat liste better to synge
Ne lady lustiere in Carolynge 
And for to speke of loue and wommanhede
Ne knight in armes don an hardy dede
To stonden in grace of his lady deere
þan hadde þis prest þis craft to lere
And to þe chanon þus he spak and sayde
ffor þe loue of god þat for vs alle deyde   
And as I may deserue it vnto ȝow
What schal þis receyt coste telleþ now 
By oure lady quod þe chanon it is deere
I warne ȝou for saue I and a frere 
In Engelond þer can no man it make
No fors quod he now sire for goddes sake
What schal I paye tel me I ȝou pray
Iwys quod he it is ful deere I say
  
Sire at oo word if þat þe list it haue
ȝe schulle paye fourty pound so god me saue
And ne were þe frendschipe þat ȝe dide er þis
To me ȝe scholde paye more ywys
This prest þe somme of xl pound anon
Of nobles fette and took hem euerychon
To þis chanon for þis ilke receyt
Al his worchinge was fraude and deceyt
Sire prest he seyde I kepe for to haue no loos
Of my craft for I wolde it were kept cloos
And as ȝe loueþ me kepeþ it secre
ffor and men knewen al my subtilte
By god men wolde haue so gret envye
To me by cause of my philosophie
I scholde be deed þer were non oþer weye
God it forbede quod þe preest what seye
ȝet hadde I leuer spenden al þe good
Which þat I haue and elles waxe I wood
þan þat ȝe schulde falle in such mescheef
ffor ȝoure good wil sire haue ȝe right good preef
Quoþ þe chanon and sire wol graunt mercy
he wente his way and neuer þe prest he sey
After þat day and whan þat þis prest scholde
maken assay at swich tyme as he wolde
Of þis receyt far wel it wolde not be
lo þus byiaped and bygyled was he
þus makeþ he his introduccion
To bringe folk to here destruccion  
Considereþ sires how þat in eche astate
Bitwixe men and gold þer is debate
So ferforþ þat vnneþes þer is non
This multiplyȝing blendeþ so many oon
þat in good faiþ I trowe þat it be
þe cause grettest of þis skarsete
This philosophres speken so mystily
In þis craft þat men can not come þerby
  
ffor ony witte þat men han now a dayes
þey may wel chitre and Iangle as don þis Iayes
And in here termes sette lust and peyne
But to here purpos schul þey neuer atteyne
A man may lightliche lerne if he haþ ought
To multiplye and brynge his good to nouȝt
lo such a lucre is in þis lusty game
A mannes merþe it wol torne alle to grame
And empte also grete and heuye purses
And make folk to purchacen curses
Of hem þat han þerto here good ylent
O fy for schame þey þat haue be brent
Allas can þey nat fle þe fyres hete
ȝe þat it vsen I rede ȝe it lete
lest ȝe lese al for bet þan neuer is late
Neuer to þriue were to longe a date
þough ȝe prolle ay ȝe schulle it neuer fynde
ȝe ben as bolde as is bayard þe blynde
þat blundreth forþ and peril casteþ he non
he is as bold to renne agayn a stoon
As for to go bysydes in þe weye
So fare ȝe þat multiplie I seye
If þat ȝoure yȝen may not seen aright
lokeþ þat ȝoure mynd lakke nought his sight
ffor þough ȝe loke neuer so brode and stare 
ȝe schulle nat wynne a myte in þat chaffare
But wasten al þat ȝe may Rappe and renne
Wiþdrawe þe fir lest it so faste brenne  
Medleþ nomore wiþ þat art I mene
ffor if ȝe doon ȝour þrift is gon ful clene 
And right as swithe I wol ȝou telle heere
What þat þe philosophres sein in þis matere
lo þus seiþ arnold of þe newe toun
As his Rosarie makeþ mencioun
he seiþ right þus wiþouten eny lye
þer may no man mercurie mortifie
  
But if it be wiþ his broþeres knowleching
how þat he which þat first seyde þis þing
Of Philosophres fader was hermes 
he saiþ how þat þe dragon douteles
Ne dyeþ not but if he be slayn
Wiþ his broþer and þat is for to sayn
By þe dragon mercurie and non oþer
he vnderstood þat bremston were his broþer
þat on of Sol and luna were ydrawe
And þerfore sayde he tak heed to my sawe
lat no man busye him þis art for to seche
But he þat þe entencion and þe speche
Of philosophres vnderstonde can
And if he do he is a lewed man
ffor þis science and þis connyng quod he 
Is of þe secre of Secrees parde
Also þer was a disciple of Plato
That on a tyme sayde his mayster to
As his book Somer wil bere witnesse
And þis was his demaunde in soþfastnesse
Telle me þe name of þe pryuy stoon
And plato answerde vnto him anon
Tak þe stoon þat titanos men name
Which is þat quod he magnasia þe same 
Seyde Plato ȝee Sire and is it þus
This is ignotum per ignocius
What is magnasia goode sire I pray
It is a water þat is maad I say  
Of elementes foure quod Plato
Tel me þe roche goode sire quod he þo
Of þat water if it be ȝour wille
Nay nay quod Plato certeyn þat I nylle
þe Philosophres were sworn echon
þat þey scholde discouere it to no mon
Ne in no book it write in no manere
ffor vnto crist it is so leef and deere
  
þat he wil nat þat it discouered be
But where it likeþ to his deite
Man to enspire and eek for to defende
Whom þat him likeþ lo þis is þe ende 
Thanne conclude I þus siþens þat god of heuene
Ne wole nat þat þe Philosophres neuene
how þat a man schal come vnto þis stoon
I rede as for þe beste lat it goon
ffor who so maketh god his aduersarie
As for to worche eny þing in contrarie 
vnto his wille certes neuer schal he þriue
þough þat he multiplie terme of his lyue
And þere a poynt for ended is my tale
God sende euery trewe man boote of his bale amen

THer was as telleþ vs Titus lyueus
A knight þat cleped was virgineus
ffulfilled of honoures and worþinesse
And strong of frendes and of gret richesse
A doughter he hadde by his wyf
And neuere hadde he mo in alle his lyf
ffair was þis mayde in excellent beaute
Abouen euery wight þat man may se
ffor nature haþ with souerein diligence
fformed hire in so gret excellence
As þough sche wolde say lo I nature
Thus can I forme and peinte a creature
Whan þat me list who can me countrefete  
Pigmalion nouȝt þough he alwey forge and bete
Or graue or peynte for I dar wel sayn
Apollus ȝephirus schulde worche in vayn
To graue or paynte or forge or bete
ȝif þey presumede me for to countirfete
ffor he þat is þe formour principal
haþ maad me his viker general
To forme and peynte ech erþely creature
Right as me lyst for al þing is in my cure
vnder þe moone þat may wane and waxe
And for my werke no þing wol I axe
  
My lord and I ben fully at acord
I made hire to þe worschip of my lord
So do I alle myn oþre creatures
Of what colour þey be or what figures
Thus semeþ me þat nature wolde say
This mayde was of age xij ȝeer and tway
In which þat nature haþ such delyt
ffor right as sche can paynte as lily whit
And rody as rose right wiþ such peynture
Sche peynted haþ þis noble creature 
Er sche was born vppon hire lymes fre
Were also bright as such colours scholde be 
And Phebus dyed haþ his tresses grete
like to þe stremes of his boornyd hete
And if þat excellent was hire beaute
A þousend fold more vertuous was sche
In hire ne lakkeþ no condicion
þat is to preise as by discrecion
As wel in body as gost chaste was sche
ffor which sche floured in virginite
Wiþ alle humilite and abstinence
Wiþ alle attemperance and pacience
Wiþ mesure eek and beryng of array
Discret sche was in answering alway
þough sche were wys as Pallas dar I seyn  
hire faucond eek ful wommanly and pleyn
None counterfeted termes hadde sche
To seme wys but after hire degre
Sche spak and alle hire wordes more and lesse
Sownyng in vertue and in gentillesse
Schamefast sche was in maydens schamefastnesse
Constant in herte and euere in busynesse
To dryue hire oute of hire slogardye
Bachus hadde of hir mouþ no maystrie
ffor will and þought doon venus encrece
As men in fyr wol casten oyle or grece 
  
And of hire owne vertue constreyned
Sche haþ ful ofte tyme hire seek feyned
ffor þat sche wolde flee þe companye 
Wher likly was to treten of folye
As is at festes  Reueles  and at Daunces
That ben occasions of dalyaunces
Suche þinges maken children for to be
To sone rype and bolde as men may se
Which is ful perilous and haþ ben ȝore
ffor al to sone may sche lerne lore 
Of boldenesse whan sche is a wijf
And ȝe maystresses in ȝoure olde lyf
þat lordes doughtres han in gouernance 
Ne takeþ of my word no displesance
þinges þat ben sette in gouernynges
Of lordes doughtres only for tuo þinges
Ouþer for ȝe han kept ȝour honeste 
Oþer ȝe han falle in frelete
And knowen wel ynough þe olde daunce
And konne forsake fully meschaunce
ffor euermo þerfore for cristes sake 
kepeþ wel þo þat ȝe vndertake
A þeef of venyson þat haþ forlaft
his likorousnesse and alle his theues craft
Kan kepe a forest best of ony man  
Now kepeþ hem wel for and ȝe wil ȝe can
lokeþ wel to no vice þat ȝe assente
lest ȝe be dampned for ȝoure yuel entente
ffor who so doþ a tretour is certayn
And takeþ heed of þat þat I schal sayn
Of alle tresoun suffreyn pestilence
Is whan a wight betrayeþ Innocence
ȝe fadres and ȝe modres eek also
þough ȝe haue children be it oon or mo
ȝoure is þe charge of alle here sufferance
Whil þey ben vnder ȝoure gouernance
  
Beþ war þat by ensample of ȝoure lyuynge
Owþer by necligence in chastysynge

If þat þey don ȝe schulle ful sore abeye
vnder a schepperde softe and necligent

Sufficeth oon ensample now as heere
ffor I moot torne aȝen to my mateere 
This mayde of which I telle my tale expresse 
Sche kepte hir self hir needed no maistresse
ffor in hire lyuyng maydens mighte rede 
As in a book euery good word and dede
þat longeþ to a mayde vertuous
Sche was so prudent and so bountyuous
ffor which out sprong þe fame on euery syde
Boþe of hire beaute and of hire bounte wyde
þat þurgh þe lond þey preised hire echone
That louede vertu saue envye alone
þat sory is of oþer mennes wele
And glad is of his sorwe and vnhele
The doctour makeþ þis discripcion
þis mayde wente on a day into þe toun
Toward þe temple wiþ hire mooder deere
As is of ȝonge maydens þe maneere
Now was þer a Iustice in þe toun  
That gouernour was of þat region
And so bifelle þis Iuge his yhen caste
vppon þis mayde hire ful faste
As sche cam forthby þer þe Iuge stood
Anon his herte chaungeþ and his mood
So was he caught wiþ beaute of þis mayde 
And to himself ful priuely he sayde 
This mayde schal be myn for ony man
Anon þe feend into his herte ran
And taught him sodeynly by what sleighte
þe mayde to his purpos wynne he mighte
  
ffor certes by no force ne by no meede
him þought he was not able for to speede 
ffor he was strong of freendes and eek sche
Confermed was in such souereyn beaute
þat wel he wiste he might hire neuer wynne
As for to make hire wiþ hire body synne
ffor which wiþ gret deliberacion
he sente after a clerk into þe toun
The which he knew for subtil and for bold
This Iuge vnto þis clerk his tale haþ told
In secre wise and made him to assure 
he scholde telle it to no creature
And if he dide he scholde leese his heed
Whan assented was þis cursed reed
Glad was þe Iuge and made glad chere 
And ȝaf him ȝiftes precious and deere 
Whan schapen was al þis conspiracie
ffrom poynt to poynt how þat his leccherie
Parformed schulde be ful subtilly
as ȝe schal here aftirward openly
hom goþ þis clerk þat highte Claudius
þis false Iuge þat highte Apius
So was his name for it is no fable 
But knowen for an historial þing notable
The sentence of it soþ is out of doute  
þis false Iuge goþ now faste aboute
To hasten his delyt al þat he may
And so bifelle sone after on a day
þis false Iuge as telleþ vs þe story
As he was woned sat in his consistory
And ȝaf his domes vpon sondry cas
This false clerk cam forþ a wel good paas
And seyde lord if þat it be ȝour wille 
As doþ me right vpon þis pitous bille
In which I pleyne vppon virginius
And if þat he wol seyn it is not þus
  
I wol proue it and fynde good witnesse
That soþ is þat my bille wol expresse
þe Iuge answerde of þis in his absence
I may not ȝiue diffinityf sentence
let don him calle and I wol gladly heere
Thou schalt haue right and no wrong heere
Virginius cam to wite þe Iuges wille
And right anon was rad þis cursed bille 
The sentence of it was as ȝe schul heere
To ȝou my lord sire Apius so deere
Scheweþ ȝoure pouere seruant Claudius
how þat a knight called virginius
Aȝens þe lawe aȝeins alle equite
holdeþ expres aȝeins þe will of me
my seruaunt which þat is my þral by right
Which from myn hous was stolen on a night
Whils sche was ful ȝong I wol it preue
By witnesse lord so þat ȝe ȝou not greue
Sche is nought his doughter what so he say
Wherfore my lord þe Iuge to ȝou I pray
ȝelde me my þralle if þat it be ȝour wille
lo þis was al þe sentence of þe bille
Virgineus gan vpon þe clerk biholde
But hastily er he his tale tolde 
he wolde haue defended it as scholde a knight  
And by witnesse of many a trewe wight
That al was fals þat seyde his aduersarie
This cursed Iuge wolde no lenger tarie 
Ne here a word more of virgineus
But ȝaf his Iuggement and seyde þus
I deme anon þis clerk his seruaunt haue
þou schalt no lenger in þin hous hire saue
Go bring hire forth and put hire in oure warde
þis clerk schal haue his þral þus I awarde 
And whan þis worþi knight virgineus 
þurgh þe assent of þe Iuge apius
  
Moste by force his deere doughter ȝyuen
vnto þe Iuge in lecchorie to lyuen
he goþ him hom and sette him in his halle
And leet anon his deere douȝter calle 
And with a face deed as ayssches colde
vppon hire humble face he gan biholde
Wiþ fadres pite stiking þorugh his herte
Al wolde he not from his purpos conuerte
Doughter quod he virginea by þy name
þer ben tuo weyes oþer deþ or schame
That þou most suffre allas þat I was bore
ffor neuer þou deseruedest wherfore
To deyen with a swerd or wiþ a knyf
O deere doughter endere of my lijf
Which I haue fostred vp wiþ such plesaunce
þat þou ne were out of my remembrance 
O doughter which þat art my laste wo 
And in my lijf my laste ioye also
O gemme of chastite in pacience
Tak þou þi deþ for þis is my sentence 
ffor loue and nat for hate þou most be deed
My pitous hond moot smyten of þin heed
Allas þat euer Apius þe say
þus haþ he falsly iugged þe to day
And tolde hire al þe cas as ȝe bifore  
han herd it nedeþ not to telle it more
Mercy deere fader quod þis mayde
And wiþ þat word sche boþe hire armes layde
Aboute his necke as sche was woned to do
þe teeres barsten out of hire eyen tuo
And sayde goode fader schal I dye
Is þer no grace is þer no remedye
No certes deere douȝter myn quod he
þanne ȝif me leue fader myn quod sche
My deþ to compleigne a litel space
ffor parde Ieffa ȝaf his douȝter grace
  
ffor to compleyne ar he hir slough allas
And god it wot noþing was hire trespas
But þat sche ran hire fader first to see
To welcome him wiþ gret solempnite
And wiþ þat word sche felle on swown anon
And after whan hir swownyng was agon
Sche riseþ vp and to hire fader sayde 
Blessed be god þat I schal deye a mayde
ȝif me my deth er þat I haue a schame
Doþ wiþ ȝour child ȝour wil a goddes name
And wiþ þat word sche prayeþ him ful ofte
þat wiþ his swerd he schulde hir smyte softe
And wiþ þat word on swoune doun sche fel
hir fader wiþ ful sorweful herte and fel
hire heed of smoot and by þe top it hente
And to þe Iuge he ȝaf it to presente
As he sat in his doom in consistory
Whan þe Iuge it say as saiþ þe story
He bad take him and honge him also faste
But right anon al þe poeple in þraste
To saue þe knight for rouþe and for pite
ffor knowen was þe fooles Iniquite
The poeple anon hadde suspecte in þis þing
By maner of þis clerkes chalangyng
That it was by þassent of Apius  
They wisten wel þat he was lecchorous
ffor which vnto þis Apius þey gon
And casten him in prison right anon
Wher as he slough himself and Claudius
þat seruant was vnto þis Apius
Was demed for to honge vpon a tre
But virgineus of his grete pite
Prayde for him þat he was exiled
And elles certes he hadde be bygyled
The remenant were honged more and lesse
þat consented were to his cursednesse
  
Here may men se how synne haþ his meryt 
Be war for noman wot how god wol smyt
In no degre ne in which maner wise
The worm of conscience wol arise
Of wicked lyf þough it so preuy be
þat noman woot of it but god and he
Wheþer he be lewed man or lered
he not how soone þat he may ben afeered
þerfore I rede ȝou þis counseil take
fforsakeþ synne er synne ȝou forsake

Owre oost gan for to swere as he were wood
harrow quod he by nayles and by blood
This was a cursed þeef a fals Iustise
As schamful deþ as herte can deuyse
So falle vpon his body and his bones
þe deuyl I bekenne him al at ones
Allas to deere boughte sche hire beaute
Wherfore I say þat alle men may se
That ȝiftes of fortune or of nature
Beþ cause of deþ of many a creature
hire beaute was hire deþ I dar wel sayn
Allas so pitously as sche was slayn
But her of wil I not procede as now
Men haue ful often more harm þan prow
But trewely myn owne mayster deere  
This is a pitous tale for to heere
But naþeles passe ouer is no fors
I pray to god so saue þin gentil cors
And þin vrynals and þin Iurdanes
Thyn ypocras and þin Galianes
And euery box ful of þin letuarie
God blesse hem and oure lady seinte marie
So mote I þe þou art a propre man
And ylike a prelat by seint Runyan
Sayde I nouȝt wel can I nouȝt speke in terme
But wel I woot þou dost myn herte to erme
That I almost haue caught a Cardyacle 
By Corpus bones but if I haue triacle
Oþer elles a draught of moyste and corny ale 
Or but I heere anoon a merye tale

A þenne my bulles schewe I alle and some  
Oure liege lordes seal is my patent

That no man be so bolde ne prest ne clerk

And after þat telle I forþ my tales
Bulles of Popes and of Cardinales
Of Patriarkes and bisschoppes I schewe
And in latyn I speke wordes a fewe
To saffran wiþ my predicacion
And for to stere men to deuoicon
þanne schewe I forþ my lange cristal stones
Icrammed ful of cloutes and of bones
Relikes þey ben as wenen þey echone

Which þat was of an holy iewes scheep

If þat þis bon be waisshe in any welle
If kow or calf scheep or oxe swelle
That eny worme haþ ybite or stronge
Touche he þis boon anon he schal be sounde
  
And ȝit also I seye forþermore
Of pokkes of scabbes and of euery sore
Schal euery scheep be hool þat of þis welle
Drinkeþ a draught and take keep what I telle
Wole euery wight er þat þe cok him croweþ
And do þing þat him oweþ

As þilke holy iewe oure eldre ous taught
his bestes and his store schal multiplye
And sires also it heleþ Ielousie
And þey a man be falle in gelouse rage
Let make wiþ þis water his potage
And neuer schal he more his wijf mystreste

Al had sche taken prestes tuo or þre

And men and wommen o þing warne I ȝou
If any wight be in þis chirche now
That haþ don synne orrible þat he
Dar nought for schame schriuen be
Or eny womman be sche ȝong or old

Such folk schuln haue no power ne grace
To offre to my relikes in þis place
And who so fyndeþ him out of such blame
þey wole come vp and offre in goddes name
And I assoile him by þe auctorite
Which þat by bulle was ygraunted me
By þis gande haue I wonne euery ȝere
An hundred mark seþenes I was pardonere
I stande lik a clerk in many a pulpette
And schewe lewed poeple and doun þey sette
  
I preche so as ȝe haue herd byfore
And telle an hundred Iapes more 
þenne peyne I me to strecche forþ my nekke
And Est and west vpon þe poeple I bekke
As doþ a dowfe sittyng vpan a berne

Of auarice and such oþer cursednes
Is al my prechinge to make hem fre
To ȝiue here pans and namely vnto me
ffor myn entent is nouȝt but for to wynne
And noþing for correccion of synne
I rekke neuer whan þat þey ben beried
þough þat here soules gon a blake beryed
ffor certes many a predicacion
Sowneþ ofte tyme of yuel intencion  
Somme for plesaunce of folk and for flaterie
To ben auaunced by ypocresye
And somme for veynglorie and somme for hate 
ffor whan I dar nouȝt oþerwise debate
þanne wil I stynge hem with my tonge smerte
In preching so þat þei schal nouȝt asterte
To be diffamed falsly if þat he
haþ trespassed to my breþeren oþer to me
ffor þough I telle nouȝt his propre name
Men schal wel knowe þat it is þe same
By symony and by oþer circumstaunces
þus quyte I folk þat doþ vs displesaunces
þus spitte I out my venym vnder hewe
Of holynesse to seme holy and trewe
But schortly myn entent I wil deuyse
I preche of no þing but of coueytise
þerfore my teeme is ȝit and euer was
Radix malorum est cupiditas 
Thus gan I preche aȝeins þe same vice
Such þat I vse and þat is auarice
  
That þough I my self be gulty in þat synne
ȝit kan I make oþer folk for to wynne
ffrom auarice and sore to repente
But þat nys nought my principal entente
I preche no þing but for coueityse
Of þis matiere I ought ynough suffise
þenne telle I of ensamples many on
Of olde stories longe tyme agon
ffor lewed poeple louen tales olde
Whiche þinges can þey wel reporte and holde
What trowe ȝe whiles þat I may preche
And wynne gold and siluer for I teche
That I wol lyue in pouert wilfully
Nay nay I þought it neuer trewely
ffor I wol preche and begge in sondry landes
ffor I wole do no labour wiþ myn handes  
And make basketes and lyue þerby
By cause I wol not beggen ydelly
I wole none of þe aposteles countrefete
I wole haue money chese and whete
Al were it ȝeuen of þe porest page
Oþer of þe porest wydewe in a village
Al scholde here children sterue for famyne
Nay I wol drynke þe likour of þe vyne
And haue a Ioly wenche in euery toun
But herkneþ lordynges in conclusion
ȝoure liking is þat I schal telle a tale
Now I haue drunke a draught of corny ale
By god I hope I schal telle ȝou a þing
Þat schal by resoun ben at ȝour liking
ffor þough my selue be a vicious man
A moreille tale ȝit I ȝou telle can
Which I am wont to preche for to wynne
Now holde ȝoure pees my tale I wol begynne

IN fflaundres whilom was a companye 
Of ȝong folk þat haunteden folye
As Ryot hasard stewes and tauernes

1Where as whyþ harpes lutes and gyternes1
They daunce and pleye at dyse boþe day and night
And eeten also and drunken ouer al here might
þorugh which þey doon þe deueles sacrifise
Wiþinne þe deueles temple in cursed wyse

þat it is grisly for to here hem swere
Oure blessed lordes body they totere

And ilke of hem at oþer synnes lowh
And right anon þenne come tomblisteres

Syngers with harpes bawdes wafereres
Suche ben verray þe deueles officers  
To kyndle and blowe þe fyr of leccherie 
That is annexed to glotonye 
The holy writ take I to witnesse 
That leccherie is in wyn and drunkenesse
Lo how þat drunken loth vnkyndely
lay by his doughtres tuo vnwetyngly
So drunke he was he nyste what he wrought
And þerfore sore repente him oughte

Whan he of wyn was replet at his feste
Right at his owen table ȝaf his heste
To slen þe Baptist Iohan ful gulteles
Senek saiþ eek goode wordes douteles
he seiþ he can no difference fynde
Bitwix a man þat is out of his mynde
And a man þat is drunkelewe
But þat wodnesse is fallen in a schrewe
Perseuereþ lenger þan doþ drunkenes
O glotenye ful of cursednes
O cause ferst of oure confusion
O original of oure dampnacion
Til crist hadde brought out wiþ his blood agayn
lo how deere and schortly was to sayn
Aboute was þe cursed vilanye 
Corrupte was al þis world þurgh glotenye
Adam oure fader and his wyf also
ffro paradys to labour and to wo
Were dryuen for þat vice it nys no drede
ffor whiles þat adam fasted as I rede
He was in paradys and whan þat he 
Ete of þe fruyte defended on a tre
Anon he was out cast to woo and pleyne
O glotonye on þe wel oughte ous pleigne
O wiste a man how many maladyes
ffolweþ of excesse and of glotenyes  
he schulde be þe more mesurable
Of his diete sittyng at þe table
Allas þe schorte þrote þe tendre mouþ
Makeþ þat Est and West north and souþ
In erþe in aier in water men to swynke 
To gete a glotoun mete and drynke
Of þis matiere o poule wel canst þou entrete
Mete vnto wombe and wombe eek vnto mete
Schal god discryuen boþe as poule saiþ
Allas a foul þing is it by my faiþ 
  
To say þis word and fouler is þe dede
When men so drynkeþ of þe white and þe rede 
þat of his þrote he makeþ his pryue
þurgh þilke cursed superfluite
The apostel wepyng saiþ ful pitously
Ther walken many of which ȝou told haue I
I say it now wepyng wiþ pitous voys
Ther ben enemys of cristes croys
Of which þe ende is deþ þe wombe is here god
O wombe o holy o stynkynge kod
ffulfilde of dunge and of corupcion
At eyþer ende of þe foule is þe soun
How gret cost and labour is to fynde
þise cookes how þey scampe and streyne and grynde 
And turnen substaunce into accident
To fulfille al þy likerous talent
Out of þe harde bones knokken þay
þe mary for þay caste nought away
þat may go þurgh þe golet softe and swoote
Of spicerie of leues bark and roote
Schal ben his sause ymaad by delyte
To make him ȝit a newer appetite
But certes he þat haunteþ suche delices
Is deed whiles þat he lyueþ in þe vices
A leccherous þing is wyn and drunkenes 
Is ful of stryuyng and of wrecchednes  
O drunken man disfigured is þi face
ffoul is þi breþ foul art þou to embrace
And þurgh þin drunken nose semeþ þi soun
As þough þou seydest ay Sampson Sampson
And ȝit god woot Sampson drank neuer no wyn
Thow fallest as it were a stiked swyn
Thyn tunge is lost and alle þin honeste cures
ffor drunkenes is verray sepultures
Of mannes wit and his discrecion
In whom þat drynke haþ dominacion
  
He can no counseil kepe it is no drede
Now kepe ȝou fro þe white and fro þe rede
Namly fro þe white wyn of lepe
þat is to selle in ffischstret or in Chepe 
This wyn of Spayne crepeþ subtilly
In oþer wynes growyng faste by
Of which þer ryseþ such fumosite
þat whan a man haþ drunken draughtes þre 
And weneþ þat he be at home in chepe
he is in spayne right at þe toune of lepe
Nought at þe Rochel ne at Burdeux toun
And þenne wolen þey sayn Sampsoun Sampsoun
But herkneþ lordinges o word I ȝou prey
That all þe souerein actes dar I say
Of victories in þe olde testament
þat þurgh verray god þat is omnipotent
Were don in abstinence and in prayere
lokeþ þe bible and þere ȝe may it leere
lokeþ attyla þe grete conquerour
Deyed in his sleepe wiþ schame and dishonour
Bledyng ay at his nose in drunkenes
A Capitayne schulde lyue in sobernes 
And ouer al þis avise ȝou right wel
What was comaunded vnto lamuel
Nought Samuel but lamuel say I 
Redeþ þe bible and fyndeþ it expressely  
Of wyn ȝeuynge to hem þat han iustice
Nomore of þis for it may wel suffice
ANd now þat I haue spoke of glotonye
Now wole I defende ȝou hasardye
hasard is verray mooder of lesynges
And of disceipt cursed forswerynges
Blaspheme of crist and mansleynges also
Of batayle of tyme and of oþer mo
It is repreff and contrarie to honour
ffor to be holde a comune hasardour
  
And euer þe hyer he is of astate
þe more he is yhalden desolate
If þat a prince vse hasardrye
In alle gouernaunce and alle polesye
he is as by comun opynyon
yhalde þe lasse in reputacion

Was sent into Corynthy  with ful grete honour  
ffro Calydonye to maken him alleaunce
And whan he cam him happede þis chaunce
þat alle þe grettest þat were of þis lande
Pleying at þe hasard he hem fande
ffor which as sone as þat mighte be
he stal him home aȝein to his cuntre
And sayde þer I wol nought lese my name
I ne wol nought take on me so gret diffame
ȝou to alleye to none hasardoures
Sendeþ oþerwise embassetoures
ffor by my trouþe me were leuer deye 
þan I to ȝou schulde hasardoures alleye 
ffor ȝe þat ben so glorious in honoures
Schal nouȝt aleye ȝou wiþ hasardoures
As by my wille ne as by my trete
Þis wise Philosophre sayde to me
loke þou vse no pley of dees in þin hous
loke eek þat to þe king Demetrus
Sente him a payre of dees of gold in scorn
ffor he hadde vsed hasardye þer byforn  
ffor which he helde his glorie and his renoun
At no value of reputacioun
lordes mighten fynden oþer maner pley
honeste ynough to dryue þe day awey
NOw wol I speke of oþes false and grete
A word or tuo as oþer bookes entrete
Gret sweryng is a þing abhominable
And fals swerynge is more reprouable
  
þe hihe god forbad sweryng at al
Witnesse at Matthew but in special
Of sweryng saiþ þe holy Ieromie
þou schalt swere soþ þin oþes and nought lye 
And swere in doome and eek in rightwisnesse
But ydel sweryng is a cursednesse
Bihold and see þat in þe ferste table 
Of heyhe goddes hestes honurable 
how þat þe secounde heste of him is þis 
Take nought my name in ydelnesse amys 
lo raþer he forbedeþ such sweryng
Or Omycyde or eny oþer cursed þing
I say as by ordre þus it standeþ
This knoweþ þat his hestes vnderstandeþ
how þat þe secounde heste of god is þat
And forþermore I wol þe telle al plat
þat vengeaunte schal nouȝt parte fro his hous
þat of his othis is so outrageous
By goddes precious herte and his nayles
And by his blood þat is in hayles
Seuen is my chaunce and þin is fyue and þre 
By goddes armes if þou falsly pleye me
þis dagger schal þurgh þin herte go
þis fruyt comeþ of þe bicched bones tuo
fforsweryng Ire falsnes homicyde
Now for þe loue of crist þat for vs dyde
leueþ ȝoure oþes boþe grete and smale
ffor cristes sake and herkne to my tale  
þise ryetoures þre of which I telle
longe er pryme ronge eny belle
Were sette hem in a tauerne for to drynke 
And as þey sate þey herde a belle clynke 
Byforn a corps was caryed to his graue
þat oon of hem gan calle to his knaue 
Go bet quoþ he and axe redyly
What corps is þis þat passeþ faste by 
  
And loke þat þou reporte his name wel
Sire quod þis boye it nedeþ neuer a del
It was me told er ȝe came here to oures
He was parde an old felawe of ȝoures
Al sodeynly was he slayn to night 
ffordrunke as he sate vp his benche vpright
Ther came a pryue þeef men cleped deþ
þat in his cuntre al þe poeple sleþ
And with his spere he smot his herte a tuo
And went his way wiþouten wordes mo
And maister er ȝe come in his presence 
he haþ a þousend slain þis pestilence 
Me þinkeþ it were necessarie 
ffor to be war of such an aduersarie 
Beþ redy for to mete him euermore 
þus taughte me my dame I say no more 
By seinte mary seyde þis tauernere
þe child saiþ soþ for he haþ slayn to ȝere
Hens ouer a myle wiþinne a gret village
Boþe man and womman child and page
I trowe his habitacion be þere 
To ben auysed gret wisedom it were 
Er þat he dede a man dishonour
Ȝe goddes armes quod þis ryetour
Is it such peril wiþ him for to mete
I schal him seeke by wey and eek by strete
I make avow to goddes digne bones
Herkne felawes we þre ben alle ones  
let eche of vs halde vp his hand to oþer
And eche of vs bycome oþeres broþer
And we woln slee þis false traytour deþ
He schal be slayn he þat so many sleþ
By goddes dignite er it be night
Togidre haue þese þre here hertes hight
To lyue and deye ilk of hem to oþer
As þough he were his owen sworne broþer
  
And vp þey sterte al drunken in þis rage
And forþ þey gon toward þat village
Of which þe tauerner haþ spoke byforn
And many a grisly oþ þenne haue þey sworn
And cristes blessed body þey torent
Deth schal be deed if þat we may him hent
Whan þey han goon nought fully a myle 
Right as þey wolde haue treden ouer a style
And olde and a pore man with hem mette
þis olde man ful mekely hem grette
And seyde þus now lordes god ȝou se
þe proudest of þese ryettoures þre
Answered agayn what carle wiþ harde grace
Why art þou al forwrapped saue þy face 
Why lyuest þou so longe in so gret age 
þis olde man gan loke in his visage 
And sayde þus for I can nought fynde 
A man þough þat I walked into ynde 
Neyþer in Cite ne in village
That wol chaunge his ȝouþe for myn age
And þerfore moot I haue myn age stille
As lange tyme as it is goddes wille 
Ne deþ allas nel nought haue my lyf
þus walke I lyk a resteles kaytyf
And on þe ground which is my moodres gate 
I knokke wiþ my staff erly and late
And saye leeue mooder lete me Inne
Lo how I wanse fleissch and blood and skyn  
Allas whan schullen myne bones ben at reste
Moder with ȝou wolde I chaunge my cheste
That in my chambre lange tyme haue be
ȝe for an here clout to wrappe me
But ȝit to me sche wole nouȝt do þat grace
ffor which ful hale and welked is my face
But sires to ȝou it nys no curtesye
To speken vntil an olde man vilenye
  
But he trespace in word oþer elles in dede
In holy wryt ȝe may ȝoure self wel rede 
Aȝeins an olde man hoor vpon his heede 
ȝe schullen aryse wherfore I ȝiue ȝow rede
Ne doþ nouȝt to an olde man non harme now
No more þat men dede to ȝow
In age if þat ȝe so longe abyde
And god be wiþ ȝou wheþer ȝe go or ryde
I mot go þider þer as I haue to go
Nay olde cherl by god þou schalt nouȝt so
Sayde þis olde hasardour anon
þou þartest nought so lightly by seint Ion
þou spake right now of þilke traitour deþ

haue heer my trouþe as þou art his aspye 
Telle wher he is or þou schalt abye
By god and by þe holy sacrament
ffor soþly þou art on of his assent
To slen vs ȝonge folk þou false þeef
Now sires if þat it be to ȝou so leef
To fynde deþ turne vp þis croked wey
ffor in þat groue I lafte him by my fey
vnder a tre and þere he wole abyde
Ne for ȝoure bost he nyl him no þing hyde
Se ȝe þat Oke right þere ȝe schuln him fynde
God saue ȝou þat bouȝt aȝein mankynde
And ȝou amende þus sayde þis olde man
And euery of þise ryetoures ran  
Til þey came to þe tree and þer þey founde
Of floryns fyne of gold ycoyned rounde
Wel neih a seuen buscheles as hem þought
No lenger þenne after deþ þey sought
But eche of hem so glad was of þe sight
ffor þat þe floryns so faire ben and bright
That doun þey sette hem by þe precious horde
The worste of hem he spak þe firste worde
  
Breþeren quod he take keepe what I say
My witte is gret þough þat I bourde and play
þis tresour haþ fortune to vs ȝiuen
In merþe and Iolyte oure lijf to lyuen
And lightly as it comeþ so wole we spende
Ey goddes precious dignite who wende
To day þat we schulde haue so fair a grace
But mighte þis golde be caryed fro þis place
home to myn hous oþer elles vnto ȝoures
þanne mighte we seye þat it were al oures 
þenne were we in heih felicite
but trewely by day it may nought be 
Men wolde say þat we were þeues stronge
And for oure oughne tresour don vs honge
þis tresour moste ykaried be by night
As wysly and as sleighly as hit might
Wherfore I rede let loke among vs alle
Be drawe and let see wher þe cutte wol falle
he þat haþ þe cutte wiþ herte blythe
Schal renne to toune and þat ful swythe
To brynge vs breed and wyn ful pryuyly
And tuo of ous schuln kepe ful subtilly
þis tresour wel and if he wol nought tarien
Whan þat it is night we woln þy tresour carien
By on assent wher as vs luste best
þat oon of hem broughte in his feste
And bad hem drawe and loke on whom it wol falle
And it fille on þe ȝongeste of hem alle  
And forþ toward þe toun he wente anon
And also soone as he was ygon
þat on of hem spak þus vnto þat oþer
þou wost wel þat þou art myn owen sworne broþer
Thyn prophyte wol I telle þe anon
þou wost wel þat oure felawe is gon
And heere is gold and þat ful gret plente
That it schal departed be among vs þre
  
But naþeles if I can schape it so
þat it departed were among vs tuo
had I nought don a frendes turne to þe
þat oþer answerde I not how þat mighte be
I woot wel þat þe gold is oure tuo
What schulde we seye what schulde we do
Schal it be counseil sayde þe firste schrewe 
And I schal telle in wordes fewe
What we schuln doon and bringe it wel aboute
I graunte quod þat oþer out of doute
þat by my trewþe I wol þe nouȝt bewreye
Now quoþ þe firste þou wost wel we be tweye
And tweyne of vs schuln strenger ben þan oon
loke whenne he is sette and þanne anon
Aryse as þou woldest wiþ him pleye
And I schal renne him þurgh þe sydes tweye
Whiles þat þou struggelist wiþ him in game
And wiþ þy dagger loke þou do þe same
And þenne schal al þis gold departed be
My deere freend bitwixe þe and me
þenne may we boþe oure lustes fulfille
And pleye atte dys right at oure owen wille
And þus accorded ben þese schrewes tweye
To sleen þe þridde as ȝe herde me seye
þis ȝongest which þat wente to þe toun
fful ofte in herte he rolleþ vp and doun
þe beaute of þese floreynes newe and bright
O lord quoþ he if so were þat I might  
Al þis tresour wynne to my self allone
þer nys no man þat lyueþ vnder þe trone 
Of god þat scholde lyue as mery as I
And at þe laste þe feend oure enemy
Putte in his þouȝt þat he schulde poyson beye
With which he mighte sleen his felawes tweye
ffor why þe feend fand him in such lyuyng
That hadde leue him to sorwe brynge
  
ffor þis was vtterly his entent
To slen hem boþe and neuer to repent
And forþ he goþ no lenger nolde he tarye
Into þe toun vnto a potycarie 
And preyde him þat he him wolde selle
Som poysoun þat he might his rattes quelle
And eek þer was a polkat in his hawe
þat as he sayde his Capons had yslawe 
And sayde he wolde wreken him if he might
Of vermyn þat distroyed him by night
þe apotykaries answerde þou schalt haue
A þing þat als god my soule saue
In al þis world þer nys no creature
þat eten or drunken haþ of þis confecture
Nought but þe mountaunce of a corn of whete
þat he ne schal his lyf anon forlete
ȝe sterue he schal and þat in lasse while 
þenne þou wolt gon a pace nought but a myle
þis poysoun is so strong and so vyolent
þis cursed man haþ in his hand yhent
þis þoysoun in a box and seþenes he ran
Into þe nexte strete vnto a man
And borwed him large botelles þre
And in þe tweyne þis poyson poured he
þe þridde he keped clene for his drynke
ffor al þe night he schop him to swynke
In karying of þe golde out of þat place
And whan þis ryetour wiþ sory grace  
had felled wiþ him his grete botelles þre
To his felawes aȝayn repayreþ he
What nedeþ it to sermone þerof more
ffor right as þay hadde cast his deþ afore
Right so þey haue him slayn and þat anon
And whenne þat þis was don þen spak þat oon
Now let vs drynke and sytte and make vs mery
And afterward we wolen his body bery
  
And aftirward it happed hem per cas
To take þe botel þerin þe poyson was
And drank and ȝaf his felawe drynke also
ffor which anon þey storuen boþe tuo
But certes I suppose þat Auycenne
Wrot neuer in no Canoun ne in no fenne
Mo wonder sorwes of enpoysonyng
Thus hadde þise wrecches tuo here endynge
Thus ended ben þis Omycides tuo
And eek þe false enpoysonere also
O cursed synne ful of cursednes
O traytours Omycyderes o wikkednes
O glotenye o luxurie O hasardye
þou blasphemer of crist wiþ vilenye
And oþes grete of vsage and of pryde
Allas mankynde how may it betyde
þerto þin creatour  which þat þe wrought
And wiþ his precious blood þe bought
þou art so fals and so vnkynde allas
Now goode men god forȝiue ȝoure trespas
And ware ȝou fro þe synne of auarice 
Myn holy pardoun may ȝou alle warische
So þat ȝe offre nobles or sterlinges
Oþer elles seluer spones broches and rynges 
Boweþ ȝoure hed vnder þis holy bulles
Comeþ vp ȝe wyues offreþ ȝoure wulles
Ȝoure name I entre here in my rolle anon
Into þe blisse of heuen schul ȝe gon

As ȝe were born and sires lo þus I preche
And Ihesu crist þat is oure soules leche
So graunte ȝou his pardoun to resceyue
ffor þat is best I wol ȝou nouȝt disceyue
But sires o word forgat I in my tale
I haue reliqes and pardon in my male
  
As faire as eny man in Engelond
Whiche were me yȝoue by þe popes hond
If eny of ȝou wole of deuocion

Comeþ forþ anon and kneleþ doun heere
And ȝe schuln haue my pardon þat is deere
Oþer elles takeþ pardoun as ȝe wende
Al newe and freissche at euery tounes ende
So þat ȝe offren alway newe and newe 
Nobles and pens which þat ben good and trewe
It is an honour to euerich þat is heere

To assoille ȝou in cuntre as I ryde

Comeþ forþ sire Ost and offreþ first anon
And þou schalt kisse þe relikes euerychoon

And swere it were a relyk of a seint

But by þe Crosse which þat seint Eleyne fand

In stede of relikes oþer of seintuary

So wroþ he was he nolde no word say
Now quod oure Oost I wil no lenger play
Wiþ þe ne with non oþer angry man
But right anon þe worþy knight bygan

Sire pardoner be mery and glad of cheere
And ȝe sire Oste þat ben to me so deere
I pray ȝou þat ȝe kisse þe pardoneere
And pardoner I pray þe þat þou drawe þe neere
And as we dide let vs laughe and pleye
Anon þey kisse and ryden forþ here weye
A Marchaunt whilom dwelled at Seint Denys
That riche was for which men heelde him wys
A wyf he hadde of excellent beaute
And compynable and reuerent was sche
Which is a þing þat causeþ more dispence
þen worþ is alle þe cheere and reuerence
That men haue doon at festes and at daunces
Suche salutaciouns and contynances
Passeþ as doþ þe schadewe on a wal
But woo is him þat paye moot for al
þe sely housband algates he moste paye
he moot vs cloþe and vs arraye
As for his owen worschipe richely
In which aray we daunce Iolyly
And if þat he nouȝt may per aduenture  
Or elles luste no suche spenses endure 
But þenkeþ it is waste and yloste 
Thenne moot anoþer payen for oure coste
Or lene us golde and þat is perilous
þis noble marchand held a noble hous
ffor which he hadde alday gret repayre
ffor his largenesse and for his wyf was fayre
þat wonder is but herkeneþ to my tale
Amonges all his gestes grete and smale 
þer was a monk a fair man and a bolde
I trowe a þritty wynter he was olde 
That euer in oon was drawyng to þe place
þis ȝonge monk þat was so fair of face
  
Aqueynted was so wiþ þis goode man
Siþenes þat here firste knowleche bygan
That in his hous as ffamuler was he
As it is possible eny frend to be
And for as mekel as þe goode man
And eek þis monk of which þat I bygan
Were boþe tuo yborn in o village
The monk him claymeþ as for cosynage
And he aȝein he saiþ nought ones nay
But was as glad þer of as foul of day
ffor to his herte it was a gret plesaunce
þus ben þay knitte wiþ eterne alliaunce 
And ilke of hem gan oþer for to assure 
Of broþerhode whiles þat here lyf may dure
ffre was daun Iohn and namely of dispense
As in þat hous and ful of diligence
To do plesaunce and also gret costage 
he nought forgat to ȝiue þe leste page 
In al þat hous but after here degre
He ȝaf þe lord and seþins al his meyne 
Whan þat he came som maner honest þing
ffor which þey were al glad of his comyng
As foul is fayn whan sonne vp ariseþ  
Namore of þis as now for it suffiseþ
But so bifell þis marchaund vpon a day
Schop him to make redy his array
Toward þe toun of Bruges for to fare
To byen þere a porcioun of ware
ffor which he haþ to Parys sent anon
A messanger and preyed haþ doun Ion
That he schulde come to seint Denys and pleye
Wiþ him and with his wyf a day or tweye
Or he to Bruges wente in all wyse
This noble monk of which I ȝou deuyse
haþ of his abbot as him lust licence
By cause he was a man of heih prudence
  
And eek an officer out for to ryde
To see here graunges and here bernes wyde
And vnto seynt Denys he comeþ anon
Who was so welcome as my lord daun Iohn
Oure deere cosyn ful of curtesye
Wiþ him brought he a Iobbe of maluesye
And eek anoþer ful of good vernage
And volatille as ay was his vsage
And þus I lete hem ete and drynke and pleye
This marchand and þis monk a day or tweye 
The þridde day þis marchand vp ariseþ
And on his needes sadly him aviseþ
And vp in to his countourhous goþ he 
To rekne wiþ himselue wel may be
Of þilke ȝeer how þat it with him stood
And how þat he despended hadde his good
And if þat he encresed were or non
his bokes and his bagges many oon

fful riche was his tresour and his hoord
ffor which ful faste his counterhous dore he schette
And eek he nolde noman schulde him lette
Of his acountes for þe mene tyme  
And þus he sitte til it was passed prime
Daun Iohn was rysen in þe morne also 
And in þe gardyn walkeþ to and fro
And haþ his þinges sayde deuoutely
þis goode wyf cam walkynge pryuely
In to þe gardyn þer he walkeþ softe
And him salueth as sche haþ don ofte
A mayden childe came in hire companye
Which at hire luste may gouerne and gye
ffor ȝit vnder þe ȝerde was þe mayde
O deere Cosyn myn daun Iohn sche sayde 
What eyleþ ȝou so raþe to aryse
Nece quod he it aughte ynough suffise
  
ffyue houres for to slepen on a nyght
But it were for an olde palled knight
As ben þese wedded men þat lye and dare
As in a forme sitte alway an hare
Were al forstraught wiþ houndes grete and smale
But deere neece why be ȝe so pale 
I trowe certes þat oure goode man
haþ ȝou laboured seþenes þe night bygan
þat ȝou were neede to resten hastily
And wiþ þat word he lough ful meryly
And of his owne þought he wax al reed
This fayre wyf gan to schake hire heed
And sayde þus ȝe god wot al quod sche
Nay cosyn myn it stant nouȝt so wiþ me 
ffor by þat god þat ȝaff me soule and lyf
In all þe rewme of ffraunce is þer no wyf
That lasse lust haþ to þat sory pley
ffor I may synge allas and welawey
þat I was born but to no wight quod sche
Dar I nouȝt telle how it stant wiþ me
Wherfore I þenke out of þis lond to wende
Or elles of myself to make an ende 
So ful am I of drede and of care  
This monk bygan vpon þis wyf to stare
And sayde allas my neece god it forbede
That ȝe for eny sorwe or ony drede
ffordo ȝoure self but telleþ forþ ȝoure greef
Peraduenture I may in ȝour mescheef
Counseile or helpe and þerfore telleþ me
All ȝoure annoye for it schal be secre
ffor on my portos I make an oth
þat neuer in my lijf for leef ne loþ
Ne schal I of no counseil ȝou bewreye
The same aȝein to ȝou quod sche I seye
By god and by þis portos I swere
þey men wolde me al to peeces tere
  
Ne schal I neuer for to go in to helle
Bewreye a word of þing þat ȝe me telle 
Nought for no cosynage ne alliaunce
But verreily for loue and affiaunce
Thus ben þey swore and hervpon ykiste
And ilk of hem tolde oþer what hem liste
Cosyn quod sche if I hadde a space
As I haue non and namely in þis place
þanne wolde I telle a legende of my lyf
What I haue suffred sethens I was a wyf
Wiþ myn housband and þeigh he be ȝour cosyn
Nay quod þis monk by god and by seint Martyn
he nys no more cosyn vnto me
þan is þis leef þat hangeþ on þe tre
I clepe him so by seint Denys in ffraunce
To haue þe more cause of acqueyntaunce
Of ȝou which I haue loued specially
Abouen all wommen sikerly
This were ynough on my profession
Telleþ ȝoure greef lest þat he come adoun
And hasteþ ȝou and goþ ȝoure wey anon
My deere loue quod sche O daun Iohn

But out it mot it may no lenger abyde
myn housbond is to me þe worste man

But siþenes I am a wyf it sit nouȝt me
To telle no wight of oure pryuyte
Neyþer a bedde ne in non oþer place
God schilde I scholde telle it for his grace
A wyf ne schal nat seyn of hire housband
But all honour as I can vnderstande
Saue vnto ȝou þus moche telle I schal
As help me god he nys nouȝt worþ at al
In no degre þe value of a flye
But ȝit me greueþ most his nyggardye
  
And wel ȝe woot þat wommen naturelly
Desyren þinges seuen as wel as I

hardy and wys riche and þerto fre
And buxum to his wyf and freissch a bedde
But by þat ilke lord þat for vs bledde

A sonday next I moste paye
An hundred ffrankes or elles am I lorn
Ȝet were me leuer þat I were vnborn

And if myn housbande eeke might aspye

Daun Iohn I say lene me þese hundred frankes
Par de I wol not fayle þe my þankes
If þat ȝou luste to do þat I ȝou pray
ffor at a certein day I wole ȝou pay
And do to ȝou what plesaunce and seruise
That I may do right as ȝou lust deuyse
And but I do god take on me vengaunce
As foule as hadde genylon of ffraunce
This gentil monk answerde in þis manere  
Now trewely myn owen lady deere
I haue quod he on ȝou so gret a rouþe
That I ȝou swere and plighte ȝou my trouþe
That whan ȝoure housbonde is to fflaundres fare

ffor I wol bringen ȝou an hundred frankes
And wiþ þat he caught hir by þe schankes
And hire enbraced harde and kissed ofte
Goþ now ȝoure weye quod he al stille and softe
And let vs dyne as sone as euer ȝe may

Goþ now and beþ as trewe as I schal be 
Now elles god forbede sire quod sche
  
And forþ sche goþ as gelous as a pye
And bad þe cokes þat þey schulde hem hye
So þat men mighte dyne and þat anon

And dryue forþ þe world as it may be  
And kepen oure estate in priuite
Til we be deed or elles þat we pleye
A pylgrymage or gon out of þe weye
And þerfore haue I gret necessite

Of happe and fortune in oure chapmanhede
To fflaundres wol I go to morne at day
And come aȝein as sone as euer I may

And for to kepe oure good be curious
And honestly gouerne wel oure hous

Of Siluer in þi purs þou mayst nouȝt fayle
And wiþ þat word his countour dore he schette
And doun he goþ no lenger nolde he lette
And hastyly a masse was þer sayde
And speedly þe tables were layde

And richely þis monk þe Chapman fedde
And after dyner daun Iohn soburly
This Chapman took a part al pryuyly

God and seint austyn spede ȝou and gyde
I pray ȝou Cosyn wysly þat ȝe ryde
Gouerneþ ȝou also of ȝoure dyete
And temperally and namely in þis hete
Bytwixe vs tuo needeþ no straunge fare

If eny þing þer be by day or by night
If it ligge in my power and my might
That ȝe me wol comaunde in eny wyse  
It schal be doon right as ȝe wil deuyse
O þing er þat ȝe gon if þat it may be
I wolde preye ȝou for þe loue of me
An hundred frankes for a wyke or tweye
ffor certeyn bestes þat I moste beye
To store with a place þat is owres
God helpe me I wolde þat it were ȝowres
I schal nought fayle suerly of my day
Nought for a þousand frankes a myle way
But lete þis þing be secre I ȝou preye
Ȝe schulle be payed wher þat I lyue or deye
And fare now wel myn owen cosyn dere
Graunt mercy of ȝoure cost and of ȝoure chere
  
This noble marchaunt gentilly anon
Answerde and sayde O Cosyn daun Iohn
Now sikerly þis is a smal requeste
My gold is ȝoures whan þat euer ȝou leste
And nought oonly my gold but my chaffare
Tak what ȝou leste god schilde þat ȝe spare
But o þing is ȝe knowe it wel ynough
Of chapmen þat here monee is here plough
We may creaunce whiles we haue a name 
But goldles for to be it is no game
Pay it aȝein whan it liþ in ȝour ese
After my might ful fayn wolde l ȝou plese
þise hundred frankes he fette forþ anon
And pryuyly he took hit to daun Iohn
No wight in al þis world wist of þis lone
Sauyng þis marchaunt and daun Iohn allone
þey dranken and romed out to pleye
Til þat daun Iohn rydeþ to his abbeye
þe morne came and forþ þis marchaunt rydeþ
To fflaundres ward his prentys wel him gydeþ
Til he cam in to Bruges meryly
Now goþ þis marchaunt faste and bysyly
Aboute his neede and byeþ and creaunceþ  
he neyþer pleyeþ at þe dys ne daunceþ
But as a marchand schortly for to telle
he leet his wyf and þer I lete him dwelle
þe sonday next þe marchaunt was agon
To seint Denys Icomen is Daun Iohn
Wiþ croune and berde freissch and newe schaue
In al þe hous þer nas so lite a knaue
Ne no wight elles þat he nas fayn
ffor þat my lord doun Iohn was come agayn
And schortly to here poynt for to gon
þis fayre wyf acordeþ to daun Iohn
And for þis hundred ffrankes he schulde al night
haue hire in his armes bolt vpright
  
And þis acorde parfourmed was in dede
In myrþe al night  a busy lyf þey lede
Til it was day þat daun Iohn went his way
And bade þe meyne far wel haue good day
ffor non of hem ne no wight in þe toun
haþ of daun Iohn right non suspecioun
and forþ he rydeþ home to his abbay
Or wher him luste no more of him I say
This marchaunt whan þat ended was þe ffayre
To seint Denys he gan for to repayre
And wiþ his wyf he makeþ feste and chere
And telleþ hire þat chaffare is so deere
þat needes moste he make a Cheuesaunce
ffor he was bounden in a reconysaunce
To paye xx þousand scheldes anon
ffor which þis marchaunt is ywont to gon
To borwe of certein frendes þat he hadde
A certeyn frankes and some wiþ him he ladde
And whan þat he was come in to þe toun
ffor gret chierte and gret affeccioun
vnto daun Iohn he ferst him goþ to pleye
Nought for to borwe of him no moneye
But for to wite and se of his welfare  
And for to tellen him of his chaffare
As frendes don when þey ben mette in feere
Daun Iohn him makeþ feste and mery cheere
And he him tolde aȝein ful specially
how he hadde brought ful wel and graciously
þanked be god al hool his marchaundise
Saue þat he moste in all maner wyse
Maken a cheuysance as for his beste
And þenne he schulde be in ioye and reste
Daun Iohn answerde certes I am fayn
þat ȝe in hele be come home agayn
And if þat I were riche as haue I blisse
Of twenty þousand scheldes scholde ȝe nouȝt misse
  
ffor ȝe so kyndely þis oþer day
Lente me golde as I can and may
I þanke ȝou by god and by seint Iame
But naþeles I took vnto oure dame
Ȝoure wyf at home þe same gold aȝain
vpon ȝoure benche sche wot it wel certain
By certein toknes þat I can hire telle 
Now by ȝoure leue I may no lenger dwelle
Oure abbot wol out of þis toun anon
And in his companye mot I gon
Gret wel oure dame myn owen nece swete
And fare wel dere cosyn til we mete
This marchaunt wiþ þat was ful war and wys
Creaunsed haþ and eek payed in Parys
To certein lumbardes redy in here hand

And home he goþ mery as popyngay
ffor wel he knew he stood in such aray

A þousend frankes abouen al his costage
his wyf ful redy mette him atte gate
As sche was wont of old vsage algate
And al þat night in mirþe þey besette   
ffor he was riche and clerly out of dette
Whan it was day þis marchant gan enbrace 
his wyf al newe and kissed hire on hire face
And vp he goþ and makeþ it wonder tough
No more quod sche by god ȝe haue ynough
And wantounly aȝein wiþ him sche pleyde
Tille atte laste þat þis marchant seyde
By god quod he I am a litel wroþ
Wiþ ȝou my wyf þough it be me loth
And wote ȝe why by god as þat I gesse
ffor ye haue made a maner straungenesse
Bytwixen me and my cosyn daun Iohn
Ȝe schulde haue warned me er I hadde gon
  
þat he hadde ȝou an hundred frankes payed
By redy tokne and he him held yuel payed
ffor þat I to him spak of cheuysaunce
Me semed so as by his contynaunce
But naþeles by god and heuen king
I þoughte nought to axe of him no þing
I pray þe wyf ne do no more so
Telle me alway er þat I fro þe go
If eny dettour haþ in myn absence
Ipayed þe leste þurgh þin necligence
I might him axe a þing þat he haþ payed
þis was nas nough affered ne affrayed
But boldely sche seyde and þat anon
Mary I diffye þat false monk daun Iohn
I kepe nought of his tokenes neuer a deel
he tok me certein gold þis wot I wel
What euele þedam on his monkes snowte 
ffor god it wot I wende wiþouten doute 
þat he hadde ȝoue it me by cause of ȝou
To do þer wiþ myn honour and my prow
ffor cosynage and eek for bele chere

But seþins I see I stonde in such disioynt  
I wol answere ȝou schortly to þis poynt
Ȝe haue mo slakker dettours þen am I
ffor I wol paye ȝow wel and redily
ffro day to day and if so be I fayle
I am ȝour wyf score it vpon my tayle
And I schal paye as sone as euer I may
ffor by my trouþe I haue on myn array
And nought on waste bestowed euery del
And for I haue bestowed it so wel
To ȝoure honour for goddes sake I say
As be nought wroþ but lete vs laughe and play
Ȝe schuln my ioly body haue to wedde 
By god I nyl nought paye ȝou but a bedde
  
fforȝiue it me myn owen spouse deere 
Turne hiderward and makeþ bettre cheere
This marchaunt seyh þer was no remedye
And for to chyde it nere but folye 
Seþins þat þe þing may nought amended be

But by þin lyf ne be no more so large

Toylyng ynough vnto oure lyues ende
WEl seyde by corpus dominus
Now lange mote þou sayle by þe coste
Sire gentil mayster gentil marynere 
God ȝiue þe monk a þousand last quade ȝere 
A ha felawes beþ war of such a Iape 
þe monk putte in þe mannes hood an ape 
And in his wyues eek by seint austyn
Draweþ no monkes more in to ȝoure In
But now passe ouer and let vs seke aboute
Who schal now telle ferst of al þis route
Anoþer tale and wiþ þat word he sayde
As curteysly as it hadde ben a mayde  
My lady prioresse by ȝour leue
So þat I wiste I schulde ȝou nought greue 
I wolde deme þat ȝe telle schulde
A tale next if so were þat ȝe wolde
Now wole ȝe fouche sauf my lady deere 
Gladly quoþ sche and sayde in þis manere

O lord oure lord þin name how merueilous
Is in þis large word yspredde quod she
ffor nought only þyn laud precious
Parfourned is by men of dignite
But by þe mouth of children þin bounte
Parformed is for on oure brest soukynge
Som tyme schewen þey þin heryynge
 Wherfore in laude as I can best or may
Of þe and of þe white lyly flour
Which þat þe bar and is a mayde alwey
To telle a story I wol don my labour
Nought þat I may encrece hire honour
ffor sche hireself is honour and þerto roote 
Of bounte next hire sone of soules boote
 O mooder mayde O mayde moder fre
O busch vnbrent brennyng in moyses sight
That rauyscheþ doun fro þe deytele
þurgh þin humbles þe gost þat in þe alight
Of whos vertu whan he in þin herte alight
Conceyued was þe fadres sapience
Help me to telle it in þin reuerence
 Lady þin bounte and þin magnificence
þin vertu and þin gret humilite
Ther may no tonge expresse in no science
ffor som tyme lady er men preye to þe
þou gost biforn and þin benignite
And getest vs to light þurgh þin prayere
To gyden vs vnto þin sone so clere    
My connyng is to wayk o blisful queene
ffor to declare þin grete worþinesse
That I ne may þe weighte nought susteene 
But as a childe of xij monthe elde or lesse
That can vnneþes any word expresse 
Right so fare I and þerfore I ȝou preye
Gydeþ my song þat I schal of ȝou seye
Ther was in a cite in a gret cite
Amonges cristen folk and Iewerye
Susteyned by a lord of þat cuntre
ffor foule vsure and lucre of vilanye
hatful to crist and to his companye
And þurgh þe strete men mighte ryde or wende
ffor it was fre and open at euery ende
A lytel scole of cristen folk þer stood
Doun at þe furþer ende in which þer were
Children an heepe ycome of cristes blood
That lered in þat scole ȝere by ȝeere
Such maner doctrine as men vsed þere
This is to say to syngen and to rede
As smale children don in here childhede
Among þis children was a wydewes sone
A litel clergoun vij ȝer of age
That day by day to scole was his wone 
And eek also wher he saugh the ymage 
Of cristes mooder hadde he in vsage
As him was taught to knele a doun and seye
his aue marie as he goþ by þe weye
  
Thus haþ þis wydewe hire litel child ytauȝt
Oure blisful lady cristes mooder deere 
To worschipe ay and he forgat it nought
ffor sely child wol alday sone lere
But ay whan I remembre me on þis matere
Seynt Nicholas stant euer in my presence
ffor he so ȝonge to crist dede reuerence
 This child his litel book lernynge  
As he sat in þe scole at his primere
he alma redemptoris herde synge 
As children lerned here antiphoner
And as he durste he drough him ner and neer
And herkned ay þe wordes and þe noote 
Til he þe firste vers couþe al by roote 
Nouȝt wiste he what þe latyn was to say
ffor he so ȝong and tender was of age 
But on a day his felawe gan he preye
To expounen him þis song in his langage 
Or tellen him why þis song was in vsage 
This preyde he him to construe and declare 
fful ofte tyme vpon his knees bare 
his felawe which þat elder was þan he
Answerde him þus þis song I haue herd say
Was maked of oure blisful lady fre
hire to salue and eeke hire for to pray
To ben oure helpe and socour whan we deye
I can no more expounde in þis matiere
I lerne song I can but smale gramere 
 And is þis song ymade in reuerence
Of cristes mooder sayde þis Innocent
Now certes I wol don my diligence
To konne it er Cristemas be went
  
þough þat I for my prymer schal be schent
And schal  beten þries in an houre
I wol it konne oure lady to honoure
 his felawe taught him homward pryuyly
ffro day to day til he couþe it by roote
And þenne he sang it wel and boldely
ffro word to word acordyng to þe note 
þries on a day it passeþ þurgh his þrote 
To scoleward and homward whan he went
On cristes moder sette was his entent
As I haue sayde þurghout þe Iewerie
This litel childe as he came to and fro  
fful meryly þen wolde he synge and crye 
On alma redemptoris euermo
The swetnes haþ his herte perced so
Of cristes mooder þat to hure to preye
He can nought stynte of syngynge by þe weye 
 Oure firste foo þe serpent Sathanas
That haþ in Iewes his waspes neste
vp swalle and sayde O Ebrayke poeple allas 
Is þis a þing to ȝou þat is honeste 
þat suche a boy schal walken as him leste 
In ȝoure despite and syngen of such sentence
Which is aȝein oure lawes reuerence 
 ffro þennes forth þe Iewes han conspired
This Innocent out of þis world to chace
In homicidie þerto han þey hyred
þat in an aley had a pryue place
And as þe childe gan forby for to pace
þis cursed Iew him hente and heeld faste
And cutte his þrote and in a putte him caste 
  
 I say þat in a wardrobe þey him drewe 
Wher as þise Iewes purgen entraille
O cursed folk of heroudes al newe 
What may ȝoure euyl entent ȝou auayle 
Mordre wole out certain it wol nought fayle
And namely þere honour of god schulde sprede
þe blood out cryeþ on ȝour cursed dede
 O martyr sonded to virginite
Now maystow syngen folwyng euer in oon
The white lambe celestial quod he 
Of which þe grete euaungelist seint Iohn
In Pathmos wrot which seiþ þey þat gon
Byforn þis lambe and synge a song al newe
þat neuer fleisschly wommen þey knewe
 þis pore wydewe wayteþ al þat night
After þis litel childe but hom cam he nouȝt
ffor whom as sone as it was dayes light  
Wiþ face pale for drede and busy þought
Sche haþ at scole and elles wher him sought
Til fynally sche gan so fer aspye
þat he was seyn last in þe Iewerye
 With moodres pyte in hire brest enclosed
Sche goþ as þough sche were half out of mynde 
To euery place where sche haþ supposed
By lyklyhede hire childe for to fynde
And euer on cristes moder meke and kynde
Sche cryed and at þe laste þus sche wrought
Among þe cursed Iewes sche him sought
Sche freyneþ and sche preyeþ pitously
To euery Iewe þat dwelt in þilke place
To telle hire if hire child went hem by
They sayden nay but ihesus of his grace
  
Ȝaf in hire þought wiþin a litel space
þat in þat place after hire sone sche cryede
þer he was caste in a putte besyde
 O grete lord þat parformed þin laude
By mouþ of Innocence lo here þy might
This gemme of chastite þis Emeraude
And eek of martirdome þe ruby bright
þer he wiþ þrote ykorue lay vpright
he alma redemptoris gan to synge
So loude þat al þe place gan to rynge
 The cristen folk þat þurgh þe strete went
In comen for to wondren on þis þing
And hastely þey for þe prouost sent
he came anon wiþouten eny taryyng
And herieþ crist þat is of heuen king
And eek his mooder honour of mankynde
And after þat þe Iewes let he bynde
This childe wiþ pitous lamentacion
vp taken syngyng his song alway
And with honour and gret procession 
They carien him to þe next abbay  
his moder swownyng by þe bere lay
vnneþes mighte þe poeple þat was þere
This newe rachel bringe fro his bere
Wiþ torment and with schameful deþ ilkon
This prouost doþ þis Iewes for to sterue
That of þis moerdre wiste and þat anon
he nolde non such cursednesse obserue 
Euel schal haue þat euel wol deserue
þerfore with wilde hors he dede him drawe
And after þat he hynge him by þe lawe
  
 Vpon þis beere ay liþ þis Innocent
Biforn þe chief auter whiles masse last
And after þat þe abbot wiþ his couent
hadde spedde him for to burye him als fast
And whan þey halywater on him cast
Ȝit spak þe child when spreynt was þe holy water
And sang O alma redemptoris mater
 This abbot which þat was an holy man
As monkes ben or elles oughten to be
This ȝonge childe to coniure he bigan
And sayde O deere childe I hailse þe
By vertu of þe holy trinite
Telle me what is þy cause for to synge
Siþenes þat þy þrote is kutte at my semynge
 My þrote is cutte vnto my nekke bon
Sayde þis childe and as by way of kynde
I schulde haue deyed ȝe long tyme agon
But ihesu crist as ȝe in bookes fynde
Wol þat his glorie laste and be in mynde
And for þe worschipe of his moder deere 
Ȝet may I synge O alma lowde and cleere
 This welle of mercy crystes mooder swete
I loued alwey as after my konnyng
And whan þat I my lyff schulde lete
To me sche cam and bad me for to synge
This anteme verraily in my mynde deynge  
as ȝe haue herd and when þat I hadde songe
Me þought sche leyde a greyn vpon my tonge 
 Wherfore I synge and synge moot certein
In honour of þe blisful martir fre
Til of my tonge of taken is þe greyn
And after þat sayde sche þus to me
  
My litel childe now wol I fecche þe
Whan þat þy grein is fro þy tonge ytake
Be nought agast I wol þe nought forsake
 þis holy monk þis abbot him mene I
his tunge out caught  and took awey þe greyn
And he ȝaf up þe gost ful softely
And when þis abbot  hadde þis wonder seyn
his salte teeres stryked doun as reyn
And gruff he fell al plat vnto þe grounde
And stille he lay as he hadde ben ybounde 
 þe couent eek lay vppon þe pauyment

And after þat þay ryse and for ben went
And toke awey þis martir fro his bere 
And in a tombe of marbill stones clere
Enclosen þey his litel body swete
Ther he is now god leue vs for to mete
 O ȝonge hewe of lincolle slayn also
Wiþ cursed Iewes as it is notable

Preye eek for vs we synful folk vnstable

On vs his grete mercy multiplye

And sayde þus what man art þou quod he
Thou lokest as þou woldest fynde an hare   
ffor euer vpon þe ground I se þe stare
Approche ner and loke meryly
Now ware ȝou sires and let þis man han place

This were a popet in armes to embrace
ffor any womman smal and fair of face

ffor vnto no wight doþ he dalyaunce
Say now somwhat seþins oþer folk han sayd
Telle vs a tale of merþe and þat anon
Oste quod I ne be nought yuel apayde
ffor oþer tale certes can I non
But of a Ryme I lerned longe agon
Ȝe þat is good quod he schuln we here
Som deynte þing me þinkeþ by his cheere

LEsteneþ lordes in good entent
And I wol telle verrament
Of miracle and solace
Al of a knight was fayr and gent
In bataille and in tornament
His name was sire Thopace
Iborn he was in ferre cuntre
In fflaundres al beȝonde þe se
At poperyng in þe place
his fader was a man ful fre
And lord he was of þat contre
As it was goddes grace
Sire Thopas was a doughty swayn
Whyt was his face as Payndemayn
his lyppes reed as Rose
his robe is like Scarlet en grayn
And I ȝou telle in good certayn
he hadde a semely nose
his berd his heer was lik saffroun
That to his gurdel straught adoun  
his schoon of Cordewayne 
Of Bruges were his hosen broun
his robe was of Ciclatoun
That coste many a Iayne
  
he couþe hunte at wylde deer
And Ryde an haukynge by þe ryuer
Wiþ gray goshauk on honde
Ther to he was a good archer
Of wrastlyng was þer non his peer
Ther any man schulde stonde
fful many a mayde bright in bour
They mourne for him paramour
When þey were bet to slepe
But he was chaste and no lecchour
And swete as is þe bremble flour
þat bereþ þe rede hepe
 And so byfell vpon a day
ffor soþe as I ȝou telle may
Sire Thopas wolde out ryde
he worþe vpon his steede gray
And in his hande a launcegay
A long swerd by his syde
he prikeþ þurgh a fair forest
Ther Inne is many a wilde beest
Ȝe boþe bucke and hare
And as he prikeþ north and Est
I telle ȝou him hadde almest
Betydde a sory care
Ther springen herbes grete and smale
The lycoris and þe Setuale
And many a clowe Gylofre
And notemuges to put in ale
Wheþer it be moyst or stale
Or for to leye in Coffre
  
The briddes syngen it is nouȝt nay
The sperhauk and þe popyngay  
That Ioye it was to heere 
The þrostilkok made eek his lay
The woode dowfe vpon þe spray
Sche sang ful loude and cleere
Sire Thopas fell in loue longyng
And whan he herde þe þrustel syng
And priked as he were wood
his faire steede in his prikynge
So swette þat men might him wrynge
his sydes were al blood
Syre Thopas eek so wery was
ffor prykyng on þe softe gras
So fers was his corage
That doun he leyde him in þat place
To maken his steede som solace
ffor he was so sauage
O seynt mary benedicite
What eyleþ þis loue at me
To bynde me so sore
Me dremed al þis night parde
An elf queen schal my lemman be
And slepe vnder my gore
An Elf queene wol I loue ywys
ffor in þis worlde no man is
Worþy to be my make in toune
All oþre wommen I forsake
And to an elf queen I me bytake
By dale and eek by downe
  
In to his sadel he cam anon
And prikeþ ouer stile and ston
And elf queene for to aspie
Til he so longe haþ ryden and gon
That he fond in a priue woon
The cuntre of fayrye
 So wylde
ffor in þat cuntre nas þer non  
    
Neyþer wijf ne childe 
Til him þer cam a Ioly geaunt
his name was cleped sire Olyphaunt
A perilous man of dede
he seyde child by Termagaunt
But if þou prike out of myn haunt
Anon I slee þin steede
 Wiþ mace
here is þe queene of fayerye
Wiþ harpe and pype and Synphonye
dwellynge in þis place 
The childe seyde so mote I þe
To morne wol I meeten þe
When I haue myn armure
And ȝit I hope par ma fay
That þou schalt wiþ þis launcelay
Abeyen it ful sore
 þurgh þine mawe 
Schal I perce if I may
Or it be fully pryme day
ffor heere þou schalt be slawe 
  
Sire Thopas drow a bak ful faste
þis geaunt at him stones caste 
Out of a felle staf slynge
But faire askapeþ child Thopas
And al it was þurgh goddes gras
And þurgh his faire berynge
Ȝit lesteneþ lordes to my tale
Murier þen þe nightyngale
ffor now I wole ȝou roune 
how sire Thopas with sydes smale 
Prykyng ouer downe and dale 
Is come aȝain to toune
his mery men comaunded he 
To maken him boþe game and glee
ffor needes moste he fight
Wiþ o geaunt with hedes þre
ffor paramour and Iolyte
Of on þat schon ful bright
Do come he seyde myne menstrales
And gestours for to telle vs tales 
Anon in myn armyng
Of Romances þat ben realles 
Of popes and of Cardynalles 
And eek of loue lykyng
They fette him ferst þe swete wyn
    


And mede eek in a mas   
and ryal spicerye
Of gyngebreed þat was f  
    
    
And lycoryus and eek comyn
Wiþ sucre þat is trye
  
He dede next his white leere
Of cloþ of lake fyn and clere
A breche and eek a scherte
And next his scherte an aketoun
And ouer þat an habergoun
ffor persyng of his herte
And ouer þat a fyn hauberk
Was al ywrought of Iewes werk
fful strong it was of plate
And ouer þat his cote armure 
As whyt as is a lyly flour
In which he wole debate
his schelde was al of gold so red
And þer Inne was a boores heed
A charbokil him besyde
And þer he swore on ale and breed
That þe geaunt schulde be deed
betyde what betyde
his Iambes were of quyrboyly
his swerdes scheþe of yuory
his helme of latoun bright
his sadel was of ruel bon
his bridel as þe sonne schon
Or as þe mone so light
his spere was of fyn Cypres
That bedeþ werre and no þing pees
The heed ful scharpe ygrounde
his steede was al dappel gray
It goþ an ambel by þe way
fful softely and rounde
  
In londe
Lo lordes myne heere a fytte
If ȝe wole eny more of hitte
To telle it wol I fonde
Now halde ȝoure mouþe par charite
Boþe knight and lady fre
And herkneþ to my spelle
Of bataile and of chiualry
And of ladyes loue drery
Anon I wol ȝou telle
Men speke of Romance of prys
Of horn child and of ypotys
Of Beuys and sire Gy
Of sire libeus and pleyndamour
But sire Thopas he bereþ þe flour
Of real chiualry
his goode steed al he bestrod
And forþ upon his way he glod
As sparcles out of þe bronde
vpon his crest he bar a tour
And þer Inne styked a lily flour
God schilde his corps fro schonde
And for he was a knight aunterous
he nolde slepen in non hous
But liggen in his hood
his brighte helme was his wanger
And by him bayteþ his destrer
Of herbes fyne and goode
  
    

him self drank water of þe welle
as dede þe knyȝt sire Peroyuelle
so worþili vnder wede
    
    
   
NO more of þis for goddes dignite
Quoþ oure hoste for þou makest me
So wery of þy lewednes
That also wisly god me bles
Myn eres ake of þin darsty speche  
Now such a rymere þe deuel y beteche
This may be wel rym dogerell quod he
Why so quod I why wilt þou lette me
More of my tale þan anoþer man
Seþens it is þe beste Rym I can
By god quod he pleynly I þe say
þou schalt no lenger rymen heere to day
Thow dost nought elles but dispendest tyme
Sire at O word þou schalt no lengere ryme
Let se wheþer þou canst telle ought in geste
Or telle in prose somwhat at þe leste
In which þer be som merþe and som doctrine
Gladly quod I by goddes swete pyne
I wol ȝou telle a litel þing in prose
þat oughte like ȝou as I suppose 
Or elles certeyn ȝe ben to daungerous
It is a moral tale vertuous
Al be it tolde somtyme in sondry wyse
Of sondry folk as I schal ȝou deuyse
As þus ȝe wote euery euaungeliste
That telleþ vs of ihesu criste
Ne saiþ nouȝt al þing as his felawe doþ
But natheles here sentence is al soþ
And all acorden as in here sentence
Al be þer in here tellyng difference
  
ffor some of hem seyn more and some lesse
Whan þey his pytous passioun expresse
I mene of mark matheu luke and Iohn
But douteles here sentence is al on
Therfore lordinges all I ȝou beseche
If þat ȝe þinke I varie in my speche
As þus if þat I telle somwhat more
Of prouerbis þen ȝe haue herd byfore
Comprehendit in þis litel tretis heere
To enforce with þeffecte of my matiere
And þough I nadde þe same wordes saye  
As ȝe han herd ȝit to alle ȝou I praye
Blameþ me nought for as in my sentence
Ȝe schal nought fynde mochil difference 
ffro þe sentence of þe tretys lyyte
After þe which þis mery tale I wryte
And herkene what I schal seye
And let me telle my tale I ȝou preye 

Whan ended was þe tale of Mellibe
And of Prudence and hire benignite
Oure hoost sayde as I am feyþful man
And By þe precious corpus Madryan
I hadde leuer þan a barel ale
That goode leef my wyf had herd þis tale
ffor sche nys no þing of such pacience
As was þis Mellibeus wyf Prudence
By goddes bones whan I bete my knaues  
Sche bringeþ me þe grete clobbed stanes
And cryeþ sle þe dogges euerychon
And breke boþe bak and bon
And if þat any neyghebour of myne
Wol nouȝt in chirche to my wif enclyne
Or be so hardy to hire to trespace
Whan sche comeþ home sche rumpeth me þe face
and cryeþ false coward wreke þin wyf
By corpus bones I wol haue þy knyf
And þou schalt haue my distaf and go spynne
ffro day to night right þus sche wol begynne
Allas sche saiþ þat euer I was yschape
To wedde a melksop or a coward ape 
That wil ben ouerled wiþ euery wight
Thou darst nouȝt stonde by þy wyf aright
This is my lyf but if þat I wolde fight
And out at þe dore anon I mot me dight
Or elles I am lost but if þat I
Be like a wilde leon fool hardy
I wot wel sche wol do me slee som day
Som neihebore and þanne I go my way
ffor I am perilous wiþ knyf on honde 
Al be it þat I dar hire nouȝt wiþstonde 
  
ffor sche is bigge in armes by my feiþ
That schal he fynde þat hire mysdoþ or seiþ
But lat vs passe away fro þis matiere 
My lord sire monk he saiþ be mery of cheere 
ffor ye schul telle a tale trewely
Lo Rouchestre stant here faste by
Ryd forþ myn owne lord brek nouȝt our game
But by my trouþe I knowe nouȝt ȝoure name 
Wheþer I schal calle ȝou my lord daun Iohn
Or Daun Thomas or elles Daun Albon
Of what hous be ȝe by your fader kyn
I vowe to god þou hast a ful fayr skyn
It is a gentil pasture þer þou gost  
Thou art nouȝt like a penant or a gost
Vppon my feiþ þou art som officer
Som worþy Sexteyn or som Celerer
ffor by my fader soule as to my dome
Thou art a maister whan þou art at home
No pouer cloysterer ne no pouer novys
But gouernour wyly and wys
And þerwithal of brawnes and of bones
A wel faryng persone for þe nones
I pray to god ȝiue him confusion
That ferst þe brought in to religion
Thou woldest haue ben a tredefoul aright
Haddest þou as gret leue as þou hast might
To perfourme al þy lust in engendure 
Thou haddest bygeten many a creature
Allas why werest þou so wyd a Cope
God ȝif me sorwe and I were a Pope
Nouȝt oonly þou but euery mighty man
Though he were schore heyhe vpon his pan
Schulde haue a wyf for al þis world is lorn
Religion haþ take vp al þe corn
Of tredyng and we borelle men ben schrimpes
Of feeble trees þer comeþ wrecched ympes
  
This makeþ þat oure heires ben so sclendre
And feble þat þay may not wel engendre
This makeþ þat oure wyfes wol assay
Religious folk for þey may bettre pay
Of venus payement þen mowen we
God woot no lussheburghes paye ȝe
But beþ nought wroþ my lord þough þat I play
fful ofte in game a soþ I haue herd say
This worþy monk took al in pacience
And sayde I wil do al my diligence
As fer as sowneþ in to honeste
To telle ȝou a tale or tuo or þre
And if ȝou liste herkne hiderward  
I wol ȝou seyn þe lyf of seint Edward
Or elles tregedys first wol I telle
Of whiche I haue an hundred in my selle
Tregedye is for to telle a certein storye
As olde bookes maken memorie
Of hem þat stood in gret prosperite
And is yfalle out of heigh degre
Into miserie and endeþ wrecchedly
And þey ben vercefyed comenly
Of sixe foote whiche þat men clepen examytron
In proce eek ben endited many oon
And eek in metre in many a sondry wyse
Lo þis aughte ȝou ynough suffyse
Now herkneþ if ȝou liste for to heere
But first I ȝou beseche in þis mateere 
þough I by ordre telle nouȝt þese þinges
Be it of Popes Emperours or Kynges
And after here ages as men writen fynde
But telle hem some bifore some behinde
As it comeþ now to my remembrance
Haueþ me excused of myn ignorance
I Wol bewayle in maner of Tregedye
The harme of hem þat standeþ in heih degre
And fellen so þat þer nas no remedye
To bringen hem out of here aduersite
ffor certein when þat fortune lust to fle
Ther may no man of hire þe cours wiþholde 

Beþ war by þis ensamples ȝong and olde
At lucifer þough he an aungel were
And nought a man at him I wol begynne
ffor þeigh fortune may non aungel dere
ffrom heih degre ȝet felle he for his synne
Doun into helle wher as he ȝet is Inne
O lucifer brightest of aungeles alle
Now art þou Sathanas þat mayst not twynne  
Out of miserie which þou art yfalle

With goddis owne finger wroght was he
And not bi getyng of mannes sperme vnclene
And welte all Paradis sauyng oo tre
Had neuyr worldly man so hye degree
As Adam had till he for his gouernaunce
Was dryuen out of his hye prosperite
To labour an to helle and to myschaunce
 Lo Sampson which was annunciate
By þangel long er his natiuite 
And was to god almighty consecrate
And stood in nobles whiles he mighte se
Was neuer such anoþer as was he
To speke of strengþe and þerto hardynes
But to his wyues tolde he his secre
Thurgh which he slough himself þurgh wrecchednes
 Sampson þis noble and mighty champion
Wiþouten wepen sauf his handes tweye
he slough and al torente þe leoun
Toward his weddyng walkyng by þe weye
his false wyf couþe him so plese and preye 
Til sche his counseil knewe and sche vntrewe
Vnto his foos his counseil gan bewreye
And him forsok and took anoþer newe
 An hundred foxes tok Sampson for Ire
And alle here tayles he togyder bond
And sette þe foxes tayles alle on fuyre
ffor he in euery tail haþ putt a brond
And þey brent alle þe cornes in þat lond
And eek here Olyues and here vynes eeke
A þousend men eek he slough wiþ his hond
And hadde no wepne but an asse cheeke
 Whan þey were slayn so þursted him þat he
Was wel neigh lorn for which he gan to preye
That god wolde of his peyne haue som pite  
And sende him drinke or elles most he deye 
And of þis asse cheeke þat was so druye
Out of a wang tooþ sprang anon a welle
Of which he drank ynough schortly to seye
Thus hilpe him god as Iudicium can telle
  
 By verray force at Gasan on a night
Maugre philistiens of þat Cite
The gates of þe toun he haþ vp plight
And on his bakke ykaryed hem haþ he
heighe on an hille where as men mighte se
O noble almighty Sampson leef and deere
That strong and noble haþ be 
In alle þis world ne hadde þer ben þy peere
 This Sampson neuer cyder drank ne wyn
Ne on his heed came Rasour non ne scheere
By precepte of þe messanger deuyn
ffor alle his strengþe was in his here
And fully twenty ȝeer by ȝere
he hadde of Israel þe gouernance
But after soone schal he wepe many a teere
ffor wommen schuln bringe him to meschance
 Vnto his lemman Dalida he tolde
That in his heeres alle his strengþe lay
And falsly to his fomen sche him solde
And slepyng vpon hire barme vpan a day
Sche made to clippe or schere his here away
And made his foomen alle his crafte aspyen
And whan þat þay him fond in such aray
They bonde him faste and putte out his eyen
 But er his heer was yclipped or yschaue
Ther was no bond þat might him bynde
But now is he in prisoun putte in a Caue
Where as þey made him at þe querne grynde
O noble Sampson strengest of mankynde
O whilom Iugge in glorie and in richesse
Now maystow wepe with þin eyen blynde  
Seþenes þou art fro wele falle in to wrecchidnesse
  
 The ende of þis Caytiffe was as I schal seye
his foomen made a feste vpon a day
And made him as here fool biforn hem pleye
And þis was  a temple of gret aray
But at þe laste he made a foul affray
ffor he tuo postes schook and made hem falle 
And doun fel temple and al þer it lay
And slough himself and eek his foomen alle
 This is to say þe princes euerichon
And eek a þousand bodyes were þey slayn
Wiþ fallyng of þe grete temple of stoon
Of Sampson ne wol I no more sayn
Beþ war of þis ensample olde and playn
That noman telle here counseil to here wyues
Of such þing as þay wolde haue secre fayn
If þat it touche here lymes or here lyues
 Of Ercule þe soueraign conquerour
Syngen his werkes lewede and heih renoun
ffor in his tyme of strengþe he bar þe flour
he slough and rafte þe skyn fro þe leoun
he of sent arwes leyde þe boost a doun
he arpyes slough þe cruel briddes felle
he golden apples rafte þe dragoun
he drough out Serberois þe hound of helle
 He slough þe cruel tyraunt Buserus
And made his hors to frete him fleissh and boon
He slough þe verray serpent venymous
Of Achilles tuo hornes brark he oon
And he slough Cacus in a Cave of ston
He slough þe geaunt Anteus þe stronge 
He slough þe grisly boor and þat anoon
And bar þe heed vpon his necke longe
  
 Was neuer wight siþen þe world bygan
þat slough so many monstres as dede he
Thurgh out þis wilde world his name ran  
What for his strengþe and for his bounte
And euery Reeme went he for to see
He was so strong þat no man might him lette
And boþe þe worldes ende saith trophe 
In stede of boundes he a piler sette
 A lemman hadde þis noble Campion
That highte Deianyre freissh as may
And as þe clerkes maden mencion
Sche haþ him sent a scherte freisch and gay
Allas þis scherte and weylaway
Enuenymed was subtily wiþ alle
That or þat he had wered it half a day
It made his boones fro his fleissch to falle 
 But naþeles some clerkes hire exusen
By oon þat highte Nessus þat it maked
Be as be may I wol hire nought accusen
But on his bakke þe scherte he weres al naked
Tille þat his fleissh was fro þe venym blaked
And whan he saugh non oþer remedye
In hote coles he haþ himself yraked
ffor wiþ no venym deyned he to dye
 Thus starf þis worþy mighty hercules
Lo who may truste on fortune ony þrowe
ffor him þat folweþ alle þis world of prees
Er he be war is ofte yleyd ful lowe
fful wys is he þat himself can knowe
Beþ war for when þat fortune lust to glose 
Than wayteþ sche hire man doun to þrowe
By such a way as he wolde lest suppose 

 The mighty trone þe precious tresor
The glorious septir and realle mageste
That hadde þe king Nabugodonosor
Wiþ tunge vnneþe may discryued be
he twyes nam Iherusalem þe cite 
The vessel of þe temple he wiþ him ladde
 At Babiloyne was his souerain see   
In which his glorie and his delit he hadde 
The fayrest children of þe blood royalle
Of Ierusalem he dede do gylde anon
And maked eche of hem to ben his þralle
Among alle oþer Daniel was oon
That was þe wisest childe of euerychon
ffor he þe dremes of þe king expowned
Wher as in Caldey clerk was þer non
That wiste to what fyn his dremes sowned
 This proude king leet make a statue of golde
Sixty cubites longe and seuen in brede
To which Image boþe ȝonge and olde
Comaunded he to lowte and haue in drede 
Or in a fourneys ful of flammes rede
He schal be brent þat wolde nought obeye
But neuere wolde assente to þat dede
Danyel ne his ȝonge felawes tweye
 This king of kynges proude and elat
he wende god þat sitte in mageste
Ne might him nought byreue of his estate
But sodeinly he lost his dignite
And like a beeste him seemed for to be
And ete hey as an oxe and lay þer oute
In reyn wiþ wilde bestes walked he
Til a certein tyme was come aboute
  
 And ylike an Egles feþeres were his heres
And nayles like briddes clawes were 
God releeued him at certeyn ȝeeres
And ȝaf him witte and þanne wiþ many a tere
he þankede god and euer his lyf in feere
Was he to don amys or more trespas
And or þat yleyd was on his beere
he knew wel þat god was ful of might and grace
 his sone which þat highte Baltyzar
þat heeld þe regne after his fader day
he by his fader couþe nouȝt be war  
ffor prowd he was of herte and of array
And eek an ydolatre was he ay
his heihe astate asseured him in pryde
But fortune caste him doun and þer he lay
And sodeinly his regne gan deuyde 
 A feste he made vnto his lordes alle
vpon a tyme he made hem bliþe be 
And þenne his officeres gan he calle
Goode bringeth forth þe vesselles quod he
Which þat my fader in his prosperite
Out of þe temple of Ierusalem byrafte
And to oure heihe goddes þanke we
Of honour þat oure eldres wiþ vs lafte
 His wyf his lordes and his concubynes
Ay drunken whiles here appetyte laste 
Out of þis noble vesseles sondry wynes 
And on a wal þis king his eyhen caste
And saugh an hande armles þat wrot ful faste
ffor feer of which he quook and siked sore
This hande þat Baltazar made so sore agast
Wrot mane techel phares and no more
  
 In al þat lond magicien was þer non
That couþe expoune what þis lettre ment
But Daniel expouned it anon
And sayde king god to þi fader sent
Glory and honour Regne tresor and rent
And he was prowde and no þing god ne dradde 
And þerfore god gret wreche vpon him sent
And him byrafte þe regne þat he hadde
 He was out cast of mannes companye
Wiþ asses was his habitacion
And eete hey as a beeste in wete and drye
Til þat he knew by grace and by resoun
That god of heuen haþ domynacion
Ouer euery regne and euery creature
And þenne hadde god of him compassion  
And him restored his regne and his figure
 Eke þou þat art his sone art proud also
And knowest alle þis þinges pryuyly
and art rebell to god and art his foo
Thou drank eeke of his vessels boldely
Thy wyf eek and þy wenche synfully
Drank of þe same vessels sondry wynes
And heryed false goddes cursedly
Ther fore to þe schapen gret pyne is 
 This hand was sent fro god þat on þe wal
Wrot mane techel phares truste me
Thin regne is doon þou weyest not at al
Deuyded is þy regne and it schal be
To Medes and to Perses ȝeuen quod he
And þilke same night þe king was slawe
And Daryus occupieth his degre
They he þerto nad neyþer right ne lawe
  
 Lordynges herby ensample may ȝe take
How þat in lordschipe is no sikernesse
ffor whan fortune wole a man forsake
He bereþ awey his regne and his richesse 
And eek his freendes boþe more and lesse
And what man haþ freendes þurgh fortune
Mishap wole make hem enemys I gesse
This prouerbe is ful soþ and ful commune
 Cenobya of Palymere þe queene
As writen Persiens of hire noblesse
So worþy was in armes and so keene
That no wight passed hire in hardynesse 
Ne in lynage ne in oþer gentillesse 
Of kinges blood of Perce sche descended
I saye þat sche nad nouȝt most fairnesse
But of hire schap sche might nought ben amended
 ffro hire childhode I fynde þat sche fledde
Office of wommen and to woode sche wente
And many a wilde hertes blood sche schedde  
With arwes brode þat sche to hem sente 
Sche was so swyfte þat sche anon hem hente
And whan þat sche was elder sche wold kille
Leouns luperdes and beres altorent
And in hire armes welde hem at hire wille
 Sche dorste wilde bestes dennes seeke
And rennen in þe mounteinz al þe night
And slepe vnder a bussche and sche couþe eeke
Wrastlen by verray force and verray might
Wiþ any ȝong man were he neuer so wight
Ther mighte no þing in hir armes stonde
Sche kepte hir maydenhed fro euery wight
To no man deyned hire to be bonde 
  
 But atte laste hir freendes han hire maryed
To Odenake a Prince of þat Cite
Al were it so þat sche hem longe taryed
And ȝe schuln vnderstonde how þat he
Hadde suche fantasies as hadde sche
But naþeles whan þey were knette in feere
They lyueden in ioye and in felicite
ffor sche of hem hadde oþer leef and deere 

By no wey þat he schulde by hire lye
But ones for it was hire pleyne entent
To haue a childe þe world to multiplye
And al so sone as sche might aspye
That sche nas nouȝt wiþ childe wiþ þat dede
Thanne wolde sche suffre him don his fantasye
Eftsone and nouȝt but ones out of drede 
 And if sche were wiþ childe at þilke caste
No more schulde he pleye þilke game
Til fully fourty dayes were paste
Thenne wolde sche ones do suffre him þe same
Al were þis Odenak wilde or tame
he gat nomore of hire for þus sche sayde
It was to wyfes lecchery and schame 
In oþer caas if þat men with hem playde  
 Tuo sones by þis Odonak had sche
The whiche sche kepte in vertu and lettrure
But now vnto oure tale turne we 
I saye þat worschipful creature
And wys þerwith and large wiþ mesure
So penyble in þe werre and curteys eeke
No more laboure mighte in werre endure
Was non þey alle þis world men schulde seke
  
 Hire riche aray mighte nought be told
As wel in vessel as in hir cloþinge
Sche was al cladde in perrye and in goolde
And eek sche lefte nought for non huntynge
To haue of sondry tonges folk knowynge
Whan þat sche leyser hadde and for to entende
To lerne bookes was al hire likynge
How sche in vertu might hir lyf dispende

 So doughty was hire housebande as sche
That þey conquered many regnes grete
In þe orient wiþ many a fair Cite
Apportienant vnto þe mageste
Of Rome and with strong hand heeld hem faste
Ne neuer might here fomen don hem fle
Ay whiles þat Oedenak dayes laste
 Here batayles who so luste hem for to ride·
Agayn Sapor þe king and oþer mo·
And how þat al þis proces felle in ·dede·
Why sche conquered and what title had þerto
And after of hire meschief and hire woo
how þat sche was beseged and ytake
let him vnto my mayster Petrarke go
That writ of þis ynough I vndertake
 Whan Odenake was deed sche mightily
The regnes huld and wiþ hir propre hand
Agayn hire foos sche faught trewely
That þer nas king ne Prince in al þat land
That he nas gladde if þat he grace fand  
That sche ne wolde vpon his land werrey
With hire þey made alleyance by band
To ben in pees and lete hir ryde and pley
  
 The Emperour of Rome Claudius
Ne him byforn þe Romain Galien
Ne dorste neuer be so coragius
Ne non Ermyne ne non Egipcien
Ne Surrien ne non arabien
Wiþinne þe feeld þat dorste with hire fight
Lest þat sche wolde hem wiþ hir handes sleen
Or with hire meyne putten hem to flight

As Eyres of here regnes alle
And hermanno and Thymalao
Here names were as Perciens hem calle
But ay fortune haþ ay in hir hony galle
This mighty queene may no while endure
ffortune out of hire regne made hire falle
To wrecchednes and to mysauenture
 Aurelion whan þat þe gouernance
Of Rome cam into his handes tweye
he schoop vpon þis queen to do vengance
And wiþ his legiouns he took his weye
Toward Cenobye and schortly for to seye
He made hir flee and at þe last hir bent
And fetered hire and eek hir children tweye
And wan þe lond and home to Rome þey went
 Among þese oþer þinges þat he wan
hire char þat was wiþ gold wrought and perre
This grete Romayn þis aurelian
Haþ wiþ him ladde for þat men schulde se
Byforn his tryumphe walkeþ sche
Wiþ gilte cheynes on hire necke hangyng
Corouned sche was as after hire degre
And ful of perre charged hire cloþing
  
 Allas fortune sche þat whilom was
Dredful to kynges and to emperoures·  
Now gaureþ al þe poeple on hire allas·
And sche þat helmed was in starke stoures·
And wan by force townes strong and toures·
Schal on hire heede were a vytremyte
And sche þat bar þe septre ful of floures
Schal bere a distaff hir costes for to quyte


Whom fortune helde so heyh in mageste
Wel oughte men þin pitous deþ complayne
Thy bastard broþer made þe to fle
And after at a sege by subtilte
þow were betrayed and lad to his tent
Wher as he wiþ his owen hand slough þe
Succedyng in þy regne and in þin rent
 The feeld of snow wiþ þe egle blak þerInne
Caught wiþ þe lymrodde coloures as þe gledes
he brew þis cursednes and al þe synne
The wicked neste was werker of þis needes
Nought Charles Olyuer þat ay took god heede
Of trouþe and honour but of armorekke
Genyloun Olyuer corupte for meede
Broughtest þis worþi king in such a brekke
 Worþy Petre king of Cypre also
þat alisaundre wan by heigh maystrie
fful many an heþen wroughtest þou ful wo
Of which þin owen liege had enuye
And for no þing but for þin Chiualrie
They in þin bedde han slayn þe by þe morwe
Thus gan fortune gouerne and gye
And out of ioye bringe men into sorwe

 Of Melane gret barnabo viscounte
God of delite and scourge of lumbardye
Why schulde nouȝt I þin fortune acounte 
Seþþen in estaat þou clombe were so hihe
Thin broþer sone þat was þin double allye
ffor he þin neuew was and sone in lawe  
Wiþinne his prison made þe to deye
But why ne how wot I þat þou were slawe 
 Of þe erl hugelyne of Pyse þe langour
Ther may no tunge telle for pite
But lytel out of pyse stant a toure
In which toure in prison putte was he
And wiþ him ben his litel children þre
The eldest skarsly v ȝer was of age
allas fortune it was gret cruelte
Suche briddes for to putte in such a kage
 Dampned he was to deyen in þat prison
ffor Roger which þat bisschop was of pyse
Hadde on him maade a fals suggestion
Thurgh which þe poeple gan on him aryse
And putten him to pryson in swich wyse
As ȝe haue herde and mete and drynk he hadde
    
And þerwiþal it was ful pore and badde
 And on a day bifelle þat in þat oure
Whan þat his mete was wont to be brought
The Gailler schutte þe dores of þe toure
He herde it wel but he saugh it nought
And in his herte anon þer felle a þought
Þat þey for hunger wolde don him deyen
Allas quod he allas þat I was wrought
Þerwiþ þe teeres felle fro his eyen
  
 his ȝonge sone þat þre ȝeer was of age
vnto him sayde fader why do ȝe wepe
When wil þe Gaylere bringen oure potage
Is þer no morsel bred þat ȝe do kepe
I am so hungry þat I may nought slepe
Now wolde god þat I might slepen euer
Thanne schulde non hunger in my wombe crepe
þer nys no þing sauf bred þat me were leuer
 Thus day by day þis childe gan to crye
Til in his fadres barme a doun it lay
And sayde fare wel fader I mot deye  
And kissed his fader and deyde þe same day
And whan þe woful fader ded him say
ffor wo his armes tuo he gan to byte 
And sayde allas fortune and welaway
Thyn fals wheel my wo I may al wyte
 His children wende þat it for hunger was
þat he his armes gnowe and nought for wo
And sayde fader do nouȝt so allas
But raþer ete þe fleissch vpon ous tuo
Oure fleissch þou ȝaf vs take oure flessch vs fro
And ete ynough right þus to him þay sayde 
And after þat wiþinne a day or tuo
They leyde hem doun right in his lappe and deyde 
Himself dispeyred eek for hunger starf
Thus ended is þe mighty erl of Pyse
ffro heih estate fortune fro him karf
Of þis tregetrye it ought ynough suffise 
Who so wol heere it in a lenger wise
Redeþ þe grete poete of ytayle 
That highte daunte for he can it deuyse
ffro poynt to poynt nouȝt o word wol he fayle


 Al þough þat Nero was as vicious
As eny feend þat liþ ful lowe adoun
Ȝet he as telleþ vs Swetheneus
This wilde world haþ in Subieccioun
Boþe Est and west and Septemptrioun
Of Rubies Saphires and of perlis white
Were alle his cloþes brouded vp and doun
ffor he in gemmes grete gan delyte
 More delicate more pompous of array
More proud was neuer emperour þan he
Þat ilke cloþ þat he had wered a day
After þat tyme he nolde it neuer se
Nettes of golde þred hadde he gret plente
To fissche in Tybre when him leste to pleye
his lustes were as lawe in his degre  
ffor fortune as his freende wolde him obeye
 He Rome brente for his delicacye
The senatoures he slough vpon a day
To heere how þat men wolde weepe and crye
And slough his broþer and by his suster lay
His mooder made he in pitous aray
ffor he hire wombe slitte to byholde
Where he consceyued was so weylaway
Þat he so litel of his moder tolde
 No teere out of his eyhen for þat sight
Ne came but sayde a fair womman was sche
Gret wonder is þat he couþe or might
Be domesman of hire ded beute
The wyn to brynge þo comanded he
And drank anon non oþer wo he made 
Whan might is ioygned vnto cruelte
Allas to deepe wole þe venym wade
  
 In ȝouþe a mayster hadde þis emperour
To teche him lettrure and curtesye
ffor of moralite he was þe flour
As in his tyme but if bookes lye
And whiles his mayster hadde of him maystrye
He made him so konnyng and so souple 
That longe tyme it was or tyrannye
Or any vice dorste in him vncouple
 This Seneka of which I deuyse
By cause nero hadde of him such drede
ffor he for vices wolde him chastise
Discretly as by word and nought by drede
Sire wolde he sayn an Emperour moot neede
Be vertuous and hate tyrauntrye
ffor which he him in bathe made to blede
In boþe his armes til he moste dye
 This nero hadde eek of a costummance
In ȝouþe aȝeins his mayster for to ryse
Which aftirward him þought a gret greuaunce  
Therfore he made him deye in þis wise
But naþeles þis Seneke þe wise 
Chees in a bathe to deye in þis manere 
Raþer þan han anoþer tormentrye
And þus haþ Nero slayn his mayster deere
 Now felle it so þat fortune lust no lenger
þe heihe pryde of nero to cherissche
ffor þough he were strong ȝet was sche strenger
Sche þoughte þus by god I am to nyse
To setten a man þat is fulfilde of vice
In heigh degre and emperour him calle
By god out of his sete I wol him tryce
When he lest weneþ sonnest schal he falle
  
 The poeple ros vpon him on a night
ffor his defaute and whan he it aspyed
Out of his dores anon he haþ him dight
Allone and þer he wende han ben allyed
he knokked faste and ay þe more he cryed
þe faster schutten þey þe dores alle
Tho wiste he wel he hadde himself begyled
And went his way no lenger dorste he calle 
 The poeple cryed and rombled vp and doun
þat wiþ his eeres herde he how þey sayde
Wher is þis false tyraunt þis Neroun
ffor fere almost out of his witte a brayde
And to his goddes pitously he sayde
ffor socour but it mighte nought betyde
ffor drede of þis him þoughte þat he deyde
and ran in to a gardyn him to huyde
 And in þis gardyn fond he cherles tweye
And saten by a fuyre ful grete and rede
And to þe cherles twey he gan to preye
To slen him and to gurden of his hede
That to his body whan þat he were dede
Were no despite ydone for his deffame 
Himself he slough he couþe no better reed  
Of which fortune lough and hadde a game
 Was neuer Capitayn vnder a king
þat regnes mo putte in subieccioun
Ne strenger was in feeld of alle þing
As in his tyme ne gretter of Renoun
Ne more pompous in heigh presumpcioun
Then Olyferne which fortune ay keste 
So likerously and ladde him vp and doun
Til þat he hed was er þat he wiste 
  
 Nought oonly þat þis world had of him awe 
ffor lesyng of Richesse and liberte
But he made euery man reneye his lawe 
Nabugodonosor was lord sayde
Non oþer god schulde honoured be
Aȝeins his heste no wight dar trespace 
Saue in Bethulya a strang Cite
Where Elyachim a prest was of þat place
 But take keepe of þe deþ of Olypherne
Amydde his hoste he drunke lay a nyght
Wiþinne his tente large as is a berne 
And ȝet for alle his pompe and alle his might
Iudith a womman as he lay vpright
Slepyng his heed of smot and fro his tent 
fful pryuyly sche stal fro euery wight
    
 What needeþ it of king antiochus
To telle his heihe and real mageste
his heighe pruyde his werkes venymous
ffor such anoþer nas neuer non as he
Redeþ which þat he was in Machabe
And redeþ þe proude wordes þat he sayde
And why he felle fro his prosperite
And in an hulle how wrecchedly he deyde
 ffortune him hadde enhaunced so in pruyde
þat verrayly he wende he mighte atteyne
vnto þe sterres vpon euery syde
And in a balaunce to weye vche mountayne   
And alle þe floodes of þe see restreyne
And goddes poeple hadde he most in hate
Hem wolde he sle in torment and peyne 
Wenyng þat god ne might his pruyde abate
  
 And for þat Nichamour and Thymothee
Wiþ Iewes were venquyscht mightily
Vnto þe Iewes swich an hate hadde he
That he hadde greythed his chaar ful hastily
And swor and sayde ful dispitously
vnto Ierusalem he wolde eft sone 
To wreke his Ire on hit ful cruelly
But of his purpos he was lette ful sone 
 God for his manace him so sore smot
Wiþ inuisible wounde ay vncurable
That in his guttes karf so and bote
That his peynes were importable
And certeynly þe wreche was resonable
ffor many mannes guttes dede he payne
But fro his pourpos cursed and dampnable
ffor alle his smerte he nolde him nought restreyne
 But bad anon apparaylen his Oste
And sodeinly er he was of hit ware
God daunted alle his pruyde and alle his boste
ffor he so sore felle out of his chare
That hurt his lymes and his skyn totare
So þat he ne mighte go ne ryde
But in a Chayer men aboute him bare
Al forbrused boþe bak and syde
 The wreche of god him smot so cruelly
That in his body wickede wormes crepte
And þerwiþal he stank so orribly
That non of alle his meigne þat him kepte 
Wheþer so þat he wook or elles slepte 
Ne mighte nought þe stynk of him endure
In þis meschief he weyled and eek wepte 
And knewe god lord of euery creature    
 To alle his host and to himself also
fful wlatsom was þe stynke of þis Careyne
No man ne mighte him bere to ne fro
And in his stynke and in his horible peyne
He starf ful wrecchedly in a mounteyne
Thus haþ þis robbour and þis homicide
That many a man made to weepe and pleyne
Such guerdon as bilongeþ vnto pruyde 
 The story of alisaundre is so commune
That euery wight þat haþ discrecioun
haþ herd somwhat or al of his fortune
This wilde world as in conclusioun
He wan by strengþe or for his heigh renoun
They weren glad for pees vnto him sende
The pruyde of man and beste he leyde a doun
Wher so he cam vnto þe worldes ende
 Comparison might neuer ȝit be maked
Betwix him and anoþer conquerour
ffor alle þis worlde for drede of him haþ quaked
he was of knighthede and of fredam flour
ffortune him made þe heier of hure honour
Saue wyn and wommen no þing might aswage 
His heihe entent in armes and labour
So was he fulle of louynge corage
 What pite were it to him þey I ȝou tolde
Of darius and an C þousand mo
Of kinges princes dukes eerles bolde
Which he conquered and brouȝt hem into woo
I say as fer as man may ryde or goo
Þe worlde was his what schulde I more deuyse
ffor þough I write or tolde ȝou euermo
Of his knighthode he mighte nought suffise
  
 Twelf ȝeer he regned as saiþ Machabe
Philippes sone of Macedo he was 
That first was king of Grece þe Contre 
O worþy gentil alisandre allas  
þat euer schulde falle such a caas
Enpoysoned of þin folk þou were
þyn S fortune haþ torned into an aas
And ȝet for þe ne weep sche neuer a tere
 Who schal men ȝeue teeres to compleyne
The deþ of gentilesse and of fraunchise
þat alle þe world weeldid in his demeygne 
And ȝet him þoughte it might not suffise 
So ful was his corage of heigh emprise
Allas who schal me helpe to endite
ffals fortune and poyson to despise
þe whiche tuo of al þis wo I wite
 By wisedom manhede and by labour
ffro humbleheed and fro Royal mageste
vp ros he Iulius þe Conquerour
That alle þe Occident by land and fee
By strengþe of hand or elles by tretee
And vnto Rome made hem tributarie
And seþenes of Rome þemperour was he
Til þat fortune wax his aduersarie
 O mighty Cesar þat in Tessalye
Aȝens Pompeus fader þin in lawe
That of þe Orient hadde al þe chiualrye
as ferre as þat þe day begynneþ dawe
þou þorugh þin knighthode þou hast hem take and slawe 
Saue fewe folk þat wiþ Pompeus fledde 
þurgh which þou puttest al þe Orient in awe
Thanke fortune þat so wel þe spedde
  
 But now a litel while I wol bewayle 
þis Pompeus þis noble gouernour
Of Rome which þat fleigh at þis batayle
I say on of his men a fals traytour
His heed of smoot to wynne him fauour
Of Iulius and him þe heed broughte
Allas Pompeye of þe Orient conquerour
That fortune vnto such a finye broughte  
 To Rome aȝein repayreþ Iulius
Wiþ his triumphe laureate ful heyȝe
But on a tyme Brutus Cassius
That euer had of his heigh estaat enuye
fful priuily had maad conspiracie
Aȝeins þis Iulius in subtil wise
And caste þe place in which he schulde deye
Wiþ boydekynnes as I schal ȝou deuyse
 Þis Iulius to þe Capithole went
vppon a day as he was wont to goon
And in þe Capitolye anon him hent
This false brutus on his foule foon
And stiked him wiþ boydekynnes anon
Wiþ many a wounde and þus þey leet him lye
But neuer gronte he at no stroke but oon
Or elles at tuo but if his story lye
 So manly was þis Iulius of herte
And so wel loued estaatly honeste
That þough his dedly woundes so sore smerte
His mantel ouer his hepes caste he
ffor noman schulde seen his priuyte
And as he lay as deyinge in a traunce
And wiste verrily þat deed was he
Of honeste ȝet hadde he remembrance
  
 Lucane to þis story I recomende
And to Sweton and to Valerius also
That of þis story writeþ word and ende
how þat þese grete conqueroures tuo
ffortune was ferst freend and siþen a foo
No man ne truste vpon his fauour longe
But haue hire in awayte for eueremo
Witnesse on alle þise conqueroures stronge
 This riche Cresus whilom king of lyde
Of whiche Cresus Cyquus sore him dradde
Ȝet was he caught amyddes alle his pryde
And to be brent men to þe fuyre him ladde  
But such a reyn doun fro þe walken schadde
þat slough þe fuyr and made him to askape
But to be war ȝet no grace he hadde
Til fortune on þe galwes made him gape
 Whan he askaped was he can not stynte
ffor to begynne a newe reyne aȝein
he wende wel for þat fortune him sente
Such happe þat he escaped þurgh þe rayn
That of his foos he mighte not be slayn
And swich a swefne vppan a night he mette
Of which he was so proud and eek so fayn
That in vengaunce he alle his herte sette
 Vpon a tree he was as þat him þoughte
There Iubiter him wisshe boþe halse and syde
And Phebus eek a fair towayle him broughte
To druye him wiþ and þerfore wax his pryde
And to his doughter þat stood him besyde
Which þat he knew in heigh sentence abounde
He bad hire telle him what it signefyed
And sche his dreemes bygan right þus expounde
  
 The tree quod sche þe galwes is to mene
And Iubiter bitokneþ snow and rayn
And Phebus wiþ his towayle so clene
Tho be þe sonne stremes for to sayn
Thou schalt an honged be fader certayn
Reyn schal þe waissche and sonne schal þe druye
þus warned him ful platte and ful playn
His doughter þat called was Phanye 
 An honged was Cresus þe proude king
His roial trone might him nought auayle
Tegedie is non oþer maner þing
Ne can synnynge crye ne bywayle
But þat fortune alway wol assayle 
Wiþ vnwar strook þe regnes that ben proude
ffor whan men trusteþ hire þan wol sche fayle
And couere hire brighte face wiþ a cloude  
HO quod þe knight goode sire nomore of þis

And meche more for litel heuynesse
Is right ynough to meche folk as I gesse 

Where as men han bien  in grete welth and ease
To here of theyr sodayn falle alas
And the contrary is Ioy  and grete solas
And whan a man hath bien in pouer estate
And clymbith vp  and wexith fortunate
And ther abydith · in prosperite  
Swiche thyng is gladsom  as it thynkyth me
And of swiche thynges  were goodely for to telle
Ya quod oure host  be seynt poulis belle

Al þough þe slough hadde neuer ben so depe

Nought helpeþ it to tellen his sentence
And wel I woot þe substance is in me

Now lete anoþer telle as I haue tolde

But I be mery Iwys I wil be blamed
And right anon he haþ his tale tamed
And þus he seyde to vs euerychon
This swete prest þis goode man sir Iohn 
A Pouere wydewe somdel stope in age  
Was whilom dwellyng in a narwe cotage
Besydes a groue standyng in a dale
This wydewe of which I telle ȝou my tale
Seþins þilke day þat sche was last a wyf
In pacience ladde a ful simple lyf
ffor litel was hire catelle and hire rent
By housbondrye of such as god hire sent
Sche fand hire self and eek hire doughtren tuo
þre large sowes hadde sche and nomo
Thre kyn and eek a scheep þat highte malle
fful sooty was hire bour and eek hire halle
In which sche eet ful many a sklender mel
Of poynant Sause hire needed neuer a del
No deynte morsell passed hire þrote
Hire dyete was acordant to hire cote
Replecion ne made hire neuere seeke
Atempree diete was alle hire Phiseke
And excersise and hertes suffisance
The gowte letted hire no þing to daunce
Ne Poplexie ne schente not hire heed
No wyn ne drank sche neyþer whit ne reed
Hire bord was serued most wiþ whit and blak
Milk and broun breed in which sche fond no lak
Seynd bacon and somtyme an ey or tweye
ffor sche was as it was a maner deye
A gardyn sche hadde enclosed alle aboute
Wiþ stikkes and a druye diche wiþoute
In which sche hadde a cokk þat highte Chaunteclere
In alle þe land of crowyng nas his peere
  
his voys was merier þan þe mery Orgon
On masse dayes þat in þe chirche gon
Wel sikerer was þe crowyng in his logge
þan is a clokke or eny abbay orlogge
By nature he knew eche assencion
Of equinoxial of þilke toun
ffor whan degrees xv were discendid  
þenne knew he þat it might nought ben amended
His cambe was redder þen þe fyn coralle
And batailled as it were a castel walle
Ylike asure were his legges and his toon
His byle was blak and as þe Iet it schon
His nayles whitter þen þe lily flour
And ylike burnysscht gold was his colour
This gentil cokke hadde in his gouernance 
vij hennes for to doon his plesance
Whiche weren his sustres and his paramoures
And wonder ylike to him as of coloures
Of which þe fairest hewed on þe þrote
Was cleped faire damisel pertelote
Curteys sche was discret and debonaire
And companable  and bar hire self so faire
Siþens þilke day þat sche was seuenyght olde
þat trewely sche haþ þe herte in holde
Of chaunteclere loken in euery liþ
He loued hire so þat wel was him þerwith
But such a ioye as it was to heere hem synge
Whan þat þe brighte sonne gan to springe
In swete acorde my leef is fare in londe 
ffor þilke tyme as I haue vnderstonde

And so bifelle þat in a dawenynge 
As Chaunteclere among his wyfes alle
Satte on his perche þat was in þe halle
And next him sat þis faire Pertelote
þis Chaunteclere gan gronen in his þrote
  
As a man þat is in his dreme drecched sore
And when þat Pertelote þus herde him rore
Sche was agast and sayde herte deere
What eyleþ ȝou to grone in þis manere
ȝe ben a verray sleper fy for schame 
And he answerde and sayde þus ma dame 
I pray ȝou þat ȝe take it not to greef  
By god me mette þat I was in such mescheef
Right now þat ȝet myn herte is sore afright
Now quod he my sweuene reed aright
And keepe my body out of foul prisoun
Me mette þat I romed vp and doun
Wiþinne oure ȝerde wher as I saugh a beeste
Was lik an hound and wolde han made areste 
vpon my body and wolde han had me deed
His colour was betwixe whit and reed
And tipped was his tail and boþe his eeres
Wiþ blak vnlik þe remenant of his heeres
his snowte smal with glowyng eyen tweye
ȝet of his look for feer almost I deye
This caused me my gronyng douteles
Avoy quod sche  ffy on ȝou herteles
Allas quod sche ffor by þat god aboue
Now haue ȝe lost myn herte and al my loue
I can nought loue a coward by my feiþ
ffor certes what so eny womman seiþ
We wolle alle desyren if it mighte be
To haue housbondes hardy wise and fre
And secre ne no nyggard ne no fool
Ne him þat is agast of euery tool
Ne non auauntour by þat god aboue
How dorste ȝe say for schame vnto ȝoure loue 
That eny þing might make ȝou aferd
Han ȝe no mannes herte and han a berd
Allas and konne ȝe be agast of sweuons

  
Sweuenes engendren of replexiones

When humours ben to habundaunt in a wight
Certes þis dreme which ȝe han herd to nyght
Cometh of þe grete superfluite
Of ȝoure reede colre sire parde
Which causeþ folk to dremen here dreemes
Of arwes and of fuyre with reede leemes
Of reede bestes þat woln hem byte  
Of Contelle and of whelpes grete an lyte
Right as he humour malencolie
Causeþ many a man in slepe to crye
ffor feere of beres and of boles blake
Or elles blake deueles woln hem take
Of oþer humours couþe I telle also
þat worken many a man in sleep ful woo
But I wol passe as lightly as I can
Lo Caton which þat was so wys a man
Sayde he nouȝt þus ne do no force of dremes
Now sire quod sche whan we flee fro þe beemes
ffor goddes loue as takeþ som laxatif
Vp peril of my soule and of my lyf
I counceile ȝou þe beste I wol not lye
þat boþe of colre and of malencolye
ȝe purge ȝou and for ȝe schuln nought tary
þough þat in þis toun is non apotecary
I schal my self to herbes techen ȝou
That schal ben ȝoure hele and ȝoure prow
And in þe gardyn þo herbes schal I fynde
The whiche han of here proprete by kynde
To purgen ȝou byneþe and eek aboue
fforȝeteþ nouȝt þis for goddes owne loue
ȝe ben ful Colrik of Compleccion
Were þe sonne in his ascencion
Ne fynde ȝou replete and ȝoure humors hote
and if it do I dar wel leye a groote
  
That ȝe schuln haue a feuer terciane
Or an agu þat may ben ȝoure bane
A day or tuo ȝe schuln haue digestyues
Of wormes er ȝe take ȝoure laxatyues
Of laureole Centure and of fumytere
Or ellis of Ellebore þat groweþ þere
Of Catapuce or of gaytres buryes
Of herbe yue growyng in oure ȝerde þer mery is
Pek hem vp right as þey growe and et hem In  
Be mery housbande for ȝoure fadres kyn
Dredeþ no dreem I can say ȝou no more
Ma dame quod he gramercy of ȝoure lore
But naþeles as touching dann Catoun
That haþ of wisdom such a gret renoun
By god men may in olde bookes reede
Oon of þe grettest auctour out of drede
Of many a man more of auctorite
þenne euer Caton was so mote I þe
That alle þe reuers sein of his sentence
And han wel founden by experience
þat dreemes ben significacions
As wel of ioye as of tribulacions
þat folk enduren in þis lyf present
Ther needeþ nouȝt to make of þis non argument
The verray preef scheweþ it in dede
On of þe grettest auctour þat men rede
Saiþ þus þat whilom tuo felawes went
On pylgrimage in a ful good entent
And happed so þey camen into a toun
Wher as þer was such congregacion
Of poeple and eek of streight herburgage
That þey ne fand as moche as a cotage 
In which þey boþe might ylogged be
Wherfore þey mosten of necessite
As for þat night departe of companye
And vche of hem goþ vnto his ostelrye
  
And took his loggynge as it wolde falle
That oon of hem was logged in a stalle
fferre in a ȝerde wiþ oxen of þe plough
þat oþer man was logged wel ynough
As was his aduenture or his fortune
þat vs gouerneþ alle as in comune
And so bifelle it lange er it was day
þis man mette in his bedde þer as he lay
how þat his felaw gan on him to calle  
And sayde allas for in an oxe stalle
This night schal I be mourdred þer I lye
Now help me deere broþer er I dye
In alle haste come to me he seyde
This man out of his sleep for feere abrayde
But whan þat he was wakened out of his slepe
he turned him and tok of þis no kepe 
Him þought his dreem was nought but vanyte
þus twyes in his sleping dremed he
And at þe þridde tyme ȝet his felawe
Came as him þought I am now yslawe
Byholde my bloody woundes deepe and wyde 
Arys vp erely in þe morne tyde 
And at þe west gate of þe toun quod he
A carte fulle of dunge þere schalt þou se 
In which my body is hidde ful pryuyly
Do þilke carte aresten boldely
My golde caused my murdre soþ to sayn
And tolde him euery poynt how he was slayn
Wiþ a ful pitous face pale of hewe
And truste wel his dreem he fand ful trewe
ffor on þe morwe as sone as it was day
To his felawes In he tok þe way
And whan he com vnto þis Oxe stalle
After his felawe he bigan to calle
The Ostiler answered him anon
And sayde sire ȝoure felawe is ygon
  
As sone as day he wente out of þe toun
This man gan falle in gret suspecion
Remembryng on his dreemes þat he mette
And forþ he goþ no lenger wolde he lette
Vnto þe west gate of þe toun and fonde
A dung carte as he wente to dunge þe londe 
þat was arrayed in þe same wyse
As ȝe han herde þe deede man deuyse
And wiþ an hardy herte he gan to crye  
Vengaunce and Iustice of þis felonye
My felawe murdred is þis same night
And in þis cart he lyþ gapyng vpright

Þat shulde kepe and rewle þis citee
Harrow allas here lith my felaw slayn
What shuld I more vnto this tale sayn
Þe peple out sterte  and caste þe carte to grounde
And in the medil of the donge þei founde
The deede man þat murdred was al newe
O blisful god þat art so iuste and trewe 
Lo how þat þou bywreyest murdre alway
Murdre wole out þat se we day by day
Mordre is so wlatsom and abhominable
To god þat is so iuste and resonable
That he wol not suffre it hiled be
They it abyde a ȝeer or tuo or þre
Mordre wole out þis is my conclusion
And right anon ministres of þe toun
And hente þe cartere and sore him pyned
And eek þe osteller so ferre engyned
That þey beknewe here wickednesse anon
And weren hanged by þe nekke boon
Heer may men see þat dreemes ben to drede
And certes in þe same book I rede
Right in þe nexte chapitre I rede of þis
I gabbe nought so haue I ioye and blis
  
Tuo men þat wolde han passed þe see
ffor certein cause into a ferre cuntre
If þat þe wynde nad ybe contrary
Þat made hem in a Cite for to tary
That stood ful mery vpon an hauen side
But on a day aȝens þe euen tyde
The wynd gan chaunge and blowen as him leste
Iolyf and glad þey wenten vnto reste
And casten hem ful erly for to seyle
But herkne þat oo man felle in gret pereyle
That oon of hem in slepyng as he lay
Him mette a wonder dreme aȝeins þe day
Him þought a man stood by his beddes syde
And him comānded þat he schulde abyde
And seyde him þus if þou to morwe wende  
Thou schalt be draynt my tale is at an ende
he awook and tolde his felawe what he mette
and prayed him his viage for to lette
As for þat day he prayde him to abyde
his felawe þat lay by his beddes syde
Gan for to laughe and scorned him ful faste
No dreme quod he may myn herte agaste
Þat I wol lette for to do my þinges
I sette nouȝt a straw by þy dremynges
ffor sweuenes ben but vanytes and Iapes
Men dreme alway of owles and of apes
And of many a mase þerwiþall
Men dremen of þing þat neuer was ne schal
But siþenes I se þat þou wolt here abyde
And þus forslowþen wilfully þe tyde
God wot it reweþ me and haue good day
And thus he took his leeue and went his way
And er þat he hadde half his cours ysayled
Not I nought why ne what meschaunce it ayled
But casuelly þe schippes botme rent
And schip and man vnder þe water went
  
In sight of oþer schippes him besyde
þat wiþ him seyled at þe same tyde
And þerfore he seyde Pertelote so deere
By suche ensamples olde maist þou leere
þat no man schulde be to recheles
Of dremes for I say þe dowteles
That many a dreem fol sore is for to drede
Lo in þe lyf of Seint kenelme I rede
þat was kenulphes sone þe noble king
Of Mertenrike how kenelme met a þing
A litel er was murdred on a day
His murdre in his avision he say
His norice him expouned eury del
His sweuene and bad him for to kepe him wel
ffor treson but he was seuen ȝeer old  
And þerfore litel tale haþ he told
Of eny dreem so holly was his herte
By god I hadde leuer þan my scherte
þat ȝe hadde herde his legende as haue I
Dame pertelote I say ȝou trewely
Macrobeus þat writ þe avisioun
In affryke of þe worþy Cyprioun
Affermeþ dremes and saiþ þat þay ben
Warnyng of þinges þat men after seen
And furþermore I pray ȝou lokeþ wel
þe olde testament of Daniel
If he heeld dreemes of any vanyte
Reede eek of Ioseph and þer schuln ȝe see
Wheþer dremes ben som tyme I say not alle
Warnyng of þinges þat schuln after falle
Loke of Egypt þe king Daun Pharao
His baker and his botiler also
Wher þey ne felten noon effecte in dremes
Who so wol seche þe acte of sondry Remes
May rede of dreemes many a wonder þing
Lo Cresus which þat was of lyde king
  
Mette he nouȝt þat he sat on a tree
Which signified he schulde anhanged be
Lo here adromacha Ectores wiff
That day þat Ector schulde lese his lyff
Sche dreemed on þe same night byforn
How þat þe lyff of Ector schulde be lorn
If þilke day he went into Batayle
Sche warned him but it might nouȝt auayle
He wente for to feighten neuer þe les
But he was slayn of oon achilles
But þilke tale is al to long to telle
And eek it is neigh day I may nouȝt dwelle
Schortly I say as for conclusion
þat I schal haue of þis auision
Of aduersitees and I say forþermore  
That I nel telle of laxatifs no store
ffor þey ben venymous I wot right wel
I hem diffye I loue hem neuer a del
Now let vs speke of myrþe and stynte al þis
Madame pertelote so haue I blis
Of o þing god me haþ sent large grace
ffor when I se þe beaute of ȝour face
ȝe ben so skarlet reed aboute ȝoure eyen
It makeþ alle my drede for to deyen
ffor al so siker as In principio
Mulier est hominis confusio
Ma dame þe sentence of þis latyn is
Womman is mannes ioye and al his blys
ffor whan I feele a night ȝoure softe syde
Al be it þat I may nought on ȝou ryde
ffor þat oure perche is maad so narwe allas
I am so fulle of ioye and solas
That I diffye boþe sweuen and dreem
And wiþ þat word he fleigh doun fro þe beem
ffor it was day and eek his hennes alle
And wiþ a chukke he gan hem for to calle
  
ffor he had founde a corn lay in þe ȝerde
Real he was nomore aferde
He feþerede pertelote twenty tyme
And tradde as ofte er it were prime
He lokeþ as it were a grym lyoun
And on his toos he romed vp and doun
Him deygned nouȝt to sette his feet on grounde
Ay chukked he whan he hadde a corn yfounde
And to him þanne ranne his wyfes alle
Þus real as a prince in his halle
leue I þis Chaunteclere in his pasture
And after wol I telle of his aduenture
When þe monþe in which þe world bigan
þat highte march when god ferst made man
Was complete and passed were also  
Seþins marche bygan þritty dayes and tuo
Bifelle þat Chaunteclere in alle his pryde
his seuen wyues walkyng him bysyde
Caste vp his eyen to þe brighte sonne
That in þe signe of Taurus was yronne
Twenty degrees and oon and somwhat more
He knew by kynde and by non oþer lore
That it was pryme and crew wiþ blisful steuene
The sonne he sayde is clumben vp on heuene
xl degrees and oon and more ywys
Madame pertelote my worldes blys
Herkne how þese blisful briddes synge
and see þe freisshe floures how þay springe
fful is myn herte of Reuel and solace
But sodeinly him fel a sorwful case
ffor euer þe latter ende of Ioye is sone ago
And comunly often tyme it falleþ so
And if a Rethor couþe faire endite
He in a Cronique mighte saufly write
As for a souereyn notabilite 
Now euery wise man herkene to me
  
This story is also trewe I vndertake
As is þe book of launcelot þe lake
þat wommen heelde in ful gret reuerence
Now wol I torne aȝein to my sentence
A kolle fox ful of sleighte and iniquite
That in þe groue had woned ȝeeres þre
By heih ymaginacion aforn caste
þe same night þurghout þe hegges braste
Into þe yerde þer Chaunteclere þe faire
Was wont and eek his wyfes to repayre
And in a bedde of worstes stille he lay
Til it was passed vndern of þe day
Wayting his tyme on chaunteclere to falle
As gladly doon þese homicydes alle  
That in awayte ligge to murþre men
O false murdrour roukyng in þy den
O newe scariote and newe Genyloun
ffals dissimulour O greke Synon
That broughtest Troye outrely to sorwe
O Chaunteclere acorsed be þat morwe
þat þou in þe ȝerde fleyȝe fro þe beemes
Thou were ful wel ywarned by þin derems
That þilke day was perilous to þe
But þat at god afore wot moot needes be
After þe opynyon of certein clerkes
Witnesse on him þat any clerk is
That in scole gret altercacion
In þis matiere and gret disputeson
And haþ ben of an hundred þousand men
But I ne can nouȝt bulte it to þe bren
As can þe holy doctour augustyn
Or Boece or þe Bisschoppe Bradwardyn
Wheþer þat goddes wille afore wetyng
Streyneþ me needely for to don a þing
Needly clepe I simple necessite
Or elles if þe free choys be graunted me 
  
To do þat same þing or to do it nouȝt
þough god forwot it er it was ywrought
Or of his wetyng streigneþ neuer a del
But by necessite condicionel
I wol not haue to doone of such matiere
My tale is of a cokk as ȝe schuln after heere
That took his counseil of his wyf wiþ sorwe
To walke into þe ȝerd vppon þe morwe
That he had mette þe dreem as I ȝou tolde
Wommens counseiles ben ful ofte colde
Wommans counseil brought vs ferst to wo
And made adam fro paradys to go
þer as he was ful mery and wel at ese 
But for I not whom it might displese  
If I councel of wommen wolde blame
Passe ouer I seyde it in my game
Rede auctours wher þey trete of such matiere
And what þay sein of wommen ȝe may heere
These ben þe cokkes wordes and nought myne
I can non harme of no womman devyne
ffayre in þe sande to baþe hire merily
liþ pertelote and alle hire sustres by
Aȝein þe sonne and Chaunteclere so fre
Sange meriere þan þe meremayde in þe see
ffor Physyalogus saiþ witterly
How þat þey sungen wel and merily
And so bifelle as he cast his ye
amonges þe wortes vpon a butterflye
He was war of þis ffox þat lay ful lowe
 No þing ne luste him þanne for to crowe
But cryed anon kok kok and vp he sterte
As man þat was affrayed in his herte
ffor naturelly a beste desireþ to fle
ffro his contrarye if he may it se
þey he neuer hadde seye it erst wiþ his ye
This Chaunteclere when he gan him espye
  
he wolde han fledde but þat þe fox anon
Sayde gentil sire allas what wol ȝe doon
Been ȝe affrayed of me þat am ȝoure freende
Certes sire þen be ȝe vnheende
If I to ȝou wolde harme or vilanye
I am nought come ȝoure councel to aspie
But trewely þe cause of my comynge
Was oonly to herkne how þat ȝe synge 
ffor trewely ȝe han as mery a steuene
As any aungel haþ þat is in heuene
Therwith ȝe han in Physike more felynge
þat hadde boys or eny þat can synge
My lord ȝoure fader god his soule blesse
And eek ȝoure mooder of hire gentilnesse  
han in myn hous Iben ful wel at eese
and certes sire ful fayn wolde I ȝou pleese
But for men speken of syngyng I wolde seye
So mote I brouke myne eyen tweye
Saue ȝou I ne herde neuer man so synge
As dide ȝoure fader in þe morwenynge
Certes it was of herte al þat he sange
And for to make his voys þe more strange
He wolde so peyne him þat wiþ boþe his eyen
He moste wynke so lowde he dide cryen
And standen on his typtoos þerwiþal
And strecche forþ his nekke long and smal
And eek he was of such discrecion
That þer was no man in no region
That him in song or wisdam mighte passe
I haue wel rad daun burnelle the asse
Among his vers þer was a kok
ffor a prestes sone ȝaf him a knok
Vpon his legges whil he was yong and nyce
He made him for to leese his benefice
But certein þer is no comparison
Betwixe þe wisdam and discrecion
  
Of ȝoure fader and of his subtilte
Now syngeþ sire for seinte Charite
Let see conne ȝe ȝoure fader countrefete
þis Chaunteclere his wynges gan to bete
As man þat couþe his treson not aspye
So was he rauysscht wiþ his flaterye
 Allas ȝe lordes many a fals flatour
Is in ȝoure Court and many a losengour
þat pleasen ȝou more by my feiþ
Then he þat soþfastnesse vnto ȝou seiþ
Redeþ ecclesiastre of flaterie
Beþ war ȝe lordes of here treccherie
This Chaunteclere stood heye vpon his toos
Strecching his necke and huld his eyen clos  
And gan to crowe lowde for þe nones
And daun Russel stert vp al at oones
And by þe gargage hente Chaunteclere
And on his bak toward the woode him bere
ffor ȝet was þere noman þat him sewed
O destyne þat mayst not ben eschewed
Allas þat Chaunteclere fel fro þe bemes
Allas his wyf ne roughte nought of dremes
And on a friday felle al þis meschaunce
O venus þat art goddesse of plesaunce
Seþines þat þi seruant was þis Chaunteclere
And in þin seruise dede al his powere 
More for delite þan þe world to multiplie
Why woldestow suffre him  on þin day to dye
O Gaufrede deere maister souerayn
That whan þy worþy king Richard was slayn
Wiþ schotte compleynedest his deþ so sore
Why ne hadde I now þin sentence and þin lore
The friday for to chyde as deden ȝe 
ffor on a ffriday schortly slayn was he
þenne wolde I schewe ȝou how þat I couþe pleyne
ffor Chaunteclere and for his peyne
  
Certes such cry ne lamentacion
Was of ladyes maade whan yleon
Was wonne and Purris wiþ his streighte swerd
Whenne he hente king Pryam by þe berd
And slayn him as seyde Enneydos
As maden alle þe hennes in þe cloos
Whan þey hadde seye of chaunteclere þe sight
But soueraynly dame Pertelote schright
fful lowder þen dede hasdrubaldes wyff
Whan þat hire housbonde hadde lost his lyff
And þat þe Romayns had berud Cartage
Sche was so fulle of torment and of Rage
þat wilfully in to þe fuyr sche sterte
And brend hir selue wiþ a stedefast herte  
O wofulle hennes right so cryede ȝe
As whan þat Nero brende þe Cite
Of Rome cryden þe Senatours wyfes
ffor þat here housbondes schulde leese here lyues
Wiþouten gilte Nero haþ hem slayn
 Now wole I turne vnto my tale agayn
This seely widewe and hire doughtres tuo
Herden þe hennes crien and make woo 
And out at þe dore sterten þay anon
And sawe þe fox toward þe groue goon
And bar vpon his bak þe kok away
And cryden out harrow and weloway
A ha þe fox and after him þay ran
And eek with staues many anoþer man
Ran colle oure dogge Talbot and Garlond
And Malkyn wiþ hire distaf in hire hond
Ran cow and calf and eek þe verrey hogges
Sore aferde for berkyng of þe dogges
And schowtyng of men and of wommen eeke
þey ronne so her hert þey þought tobreeke
They yelleden as feendes don in helle
The dokes cryden as men wolde hem quelle
  
Out of þe huyues come þe swarm of bees
þe gees for feere flowen ouer þe trees
So hidous was þe noyse a benedicite
Certes he Iakke strawe and his meynee
Ne maden neuere schoutes half so schrille
Whan þat þay wolden eny flemyng kille
As þat ilke day was maad vpon þe ffox
Of bras þey broughte beemes and of Box
Of horne and boon in whiche þey pouped
And þerwiþal þey schriched and þey schouted
It semed as þat heuen schulde falle
Now goode men I pray ȝou herkneþ alle
Lo how fortune turneþ sodeinly
The hope and eek þe pruyde of here enuye  
This Cok þat lay vpon þis foxes bak
In alle his drede vnto þe fox he spak
And sayde sire if I were as ȝe
Ȝet schuld I say as wis god helpe me
Turneþ aȝein ȝe proude cherles alle
A verray pestilence vpon ȝou falle
Now am I come vnto þis woodes syde
Maugre ȝour heed þe cok schal here abyde
I wole him ete in feiþ and þat anon
The ffox answerde in feiþ it schal be don
and  he spak þat word al sodeinly
This Cok brak fro his mouþ delyuerly
An heigh vpon a tree he fleigh anoon
And whan þe fox saugh þat he was goon
Allas quod he O Chaunteclere allas
I haue quod he don to ȝow a trespas
In als moche as I made ȝou afferd
When I ȝou hente and brought out of þe ȝerd
But sire I dede it nought in no wicked entent
Come doun and I schal telle ȝou what I ment
I schal ȝou seye soþ god helpe me so 
Nay þanne quod he I schrewe vs boþe tuo 
  
And ferst I schrewe my self boþe blood and bones
If þou begile me ofter þan ones 
Thou schalt nomore wiþ þin flaterye
Do me to synge and wynke wiþ myn ye
ffor he þat wynkeþ whan he schulde se
As wisly god let him neuer þe
Nay quod þe fox god ȝiue him meschaunce
That is so vndiscret of gouernaunce
þat iangleþ whan he schulde haue pees
Lo suche it is for to be recheles 
and necligent and trusteþ on flaterye
But ȝe þat halden þis tale a folye
As of a fox and of a cok and an hen
Takeþ þe moralite goode men  
ffor seint poule saiþ  alle þat writen is
To oure doctrine  it is ywriten ywis
Takeþ þe fruit and leteþ þe chaff be stille
Now goode god if þat it be þin wille 
As seiþ my lord so make vs alle goode men
And bringe vs alle to his heihe blisse ameN
WOt ȝe not wher þer stant a litel toun
Which þat is cleped Bobbe vp and doun
vnder þe Blee in Caunterbery way
Ther gan oure Oste for to Iape and play
And sayde syres what donne is in þe myre
Is no man for preyer ne for huyre
That wole awake oure felawe behynde 
A þeef might him ful lightly robbe and bynde
Se how he nappeþ se for goddes bones
þat he wol falle fro his hors at ones
Is þat a Cook of london wiþ meschance
Do him come forth he knoweþ his penānce
ffor he schal telle a tale by my fey
Al þough it be nought worþ a botel hey
Awake þou Cook quod he god ȝiue þe sorwe
What eyleþ þe to slepe by þe morwe
hast þou had fleen al night or art þou drunke
Or hast þou wiþ som quene al night yswunke
So þat þou mayst nought holden vp þin heed
This Cook þat was ful pale and no þing reed
Seyde oure Ost so god my soule blesse
As þer is falle on me such heuynesse
Not I nouȝt why me were leuer to slepe
Then þe beste galon of wyn in Chepe
  
Wel quod þe maunciple if it þe may don ese
To þe sir Cook and to no wight displese
Which þat heer rydeþ in þis companye 
And þat oure host wole of his curtesye
I wole as now excuse þe of þin tale  
ffor in good feiþ þi visage is ful pale
Thin eyen dasewen soþly as me þinkeþ
And wel I woot þi breþ ful soure stinkeþ
That scheweþ wel þou art nought wel disposed
Of me certeyn þou schalt nought ben yglosed
Se how he goneth lo his drunken wight
As þough he wolde vs swolwe anon right
hald clos þin mouþ man by þyn fader kyn
The deuyl of helle sette his foot þerin
This cursed breth wol infecte vs alle
ffy stynkynge swyn fy foule mote þe falle
Takeþ heede sires of þis lusty man
Now sweete sire wole ȝe iuste at þe van
Therto me þenkeþ ȝe ben wel yschape
I trowe þat ȝe haue drunken wyn ape
And þat is whan men pleye wiþ a straw 
And wiþ his speche þe Cooke wax al wraw
And on þe maunciple bygan he nodde faste
ffor lakke of speche and doun þe hors him caste
Wher as he lay til þat men him vp took
This was a fayr Chiuacheef of a cook
Allas he ne hadde holde him by his ladel
And er þat he aȝein were in his sadel
Ther was a gret schowuyng boþe to and fro
To lifte him vp and mochil care and woo
So vnweldy was þis sely pallede goste
And to þe maunciple þenne spak oure Oste
By cause þat drynke haþ dominacion
Vpon þis man by my Sauacion
I trowe he lewedly wolde telle his tale
ffor were it wyn or olde or moysty ale
  
That he haþ drunke he spekeþ so in his nose 
And fneseþ faste and eek he haþ þe pose
he hath also to don more þan ynough
To kepe him and his capel out of þe slough
And if he falle fro his capil eft sone   
Thenne schulle we alle haue ynough to doone
In liftyng vp his heuy drunken cors
Telle on þin tale of him make I no fors
But ȝit maunciple in feiþ þou art to nyce
Thus openly to reproue him of his vice
Anoþer day he wole perauenture
Reclayme þe and bringen þe to lure
I mene he speke wole of smale þinges
And for to pynchen at þine rekenynges
That were not honeste if it come to pref
No quod þe maunciple þat were a gret meschief
So might he bringe me in to þe snare
Yet hadde I leuer payen for þe mare
Which he ryt on þan he schulde wiþ me stryue
I wol not wraþþe him so mote I þryue
þat þat I spak I seyde it in my bourde
And wite ȝe wel I haue heer in my gourde
A draught of wyn ye of a rype grape
And right anon ȝe schullen seen a good Iape
This Cook schal drynke þerof if I may
vp peyne of my lyf he wol not say nay
And certeinly to tellen as it was
Of þis vessell þe Cook drank faste allas
What needeþ it he drank ynough aforn
And whan he hadde pouped in his horn
To þe maunciple he took þe gourde again
And of þat drynke þe cook was wonder fayn
And þanked him in such wise as he cowde
Then gan oure Oste to lawhe wonder lowde
And sayde I se wel it is necessarie
Where þat we goon good drink wiþ vs to carie
  
ffor þat wol tourne rancour and disese
To acord and loue and many a word to peese
O Bachus yblessed be þy name
þat so canst torne ernest in to game
Worschipe and þonke be to þy deite  
Of þat matiere ne gete ȝe nomore of me
Tel on þi tale þou manciple I þe preye
Wel sire quod he now kerkneþ what I seye
Whan phebus dwelde heer in þis erþe adoun
As olde booke maken mencioun
he was þe moste lusty bachiler
Of alle þe world and eek þe best archeer
he slough Phyton þe serpent as he lay
Slepyng agayn þe sonne vpon a day
And many anoþer noble worþy dede 
He wiþ his bowe brought as men nowe rede
Pleyen he couþe of euery menstralcye
And syngen þat it was a melodye
To heeren of his cleere voys þe soun
Certes þe king of Thebes amphyoun
That wiþ his syngyng walled þat Cite
Cowde neuer syngen half so wel as he
Therto he was þe semlyeste man
þat is or was siþen þe world bygan
What needeþ it his fetures to discryue
ffor in þis world was non so fair on lyue
he was þerwiþ fulfild of gentilnesse
Of honour and of parfyte worþinesse
This Phebus þat was flour of Bachelrye
As wel in freedam as in Chiualrie
ffor disporte in signe eek of victorie
Of Phyton so as telleþ vs þe storye
Was worþy to beren in his hond a bowe 
Now hadde þis Phebus in his hous a crowe
Which in a cage he fostred many a day
And taught it speke as þat men teche a Iay
  
Whit was þis Crowe as is a snow whit swan
And countrefeted þe speche of euery man
he cowde when he schulde telle a tale
Therwiþ in al þe world no nightyngale
Ne couþe by an hundred þousend deel  
Syngen so wonderly meryly and weel
Now hadde þis Phebus in his hous a wyf
Which þat he loued more þan his owne lyf
And night and day dyd euer his diligence
Hir for to plese and don hire reuerence
Saue oonly if þe soþ þat I schal sayn
Gelous he was and wolde haue kept hire fayn
ffor him were loþ byIaped for to be
And so euery wight in such degre
But al for nouȝt for it auayleþ nouȝt
A good wyff þat is clene of werk and þought
Schulde nought be kepte in non awayte certain
And trewely þe labour is in vayn
To kepe a schrewe for it wol nouȝt be
This halde I for a verray nycete
To spille labour for to keepe wyues
Thus writen olde Clerkes in here lyues
But now to purpos as I first bigan
This worþy Phebus doþ al þat he can
To plesen hyre wenyng by such plesance
And for his manhode and his gouernance
That no man schulde haue put him fro hir grace
But god it woot þer may no man enbrace
As to distreyne a þing which þat nature
Haþ naturelly sette in a creature
Take eny bryd and put it in a kage
And do al þin entent and þy corage
To fostre it tendrely wiþ mete and drinke
Of alle deyntees þat þou canst byþinke
And keepe it also clenly as þou may
Al þough his cage of golde be neuer so gay
  
ȝet haþ þis bridde by xx þousand folde
Leuer in a fforest þat is wilde and colde
Gon ete wormes and such wrecchedenesse
ffor euer þis bridde wol doon his busynesse
To eskape out of his cage when he may  
his liberte þe bridde desireþ ay
Let take a catte and fostre him wel wiþ melk
An tendre fleissch and make his couche of selk
And let him seen a mous go by þe walle
And anon he weyueþ milke fleissche and alle
And euery deynte þat is in þat hous
Such appetyt haþ sche to ete a mous
Lo he haþ luste his dampnacion
And appetyt flemyth discrecion
As þe wolf haþ also a vyleyns kynde
The lewedeste wolf þat sche may fynde
Of lest of reputacion þat wol sche take
In tyme whan hire luste to haue a make
Alle þise ensamples speke I by þese men
That ben vntrewe and noþing by wommen
ffor men han euere a likerous appetyt
On lowere þing to parforme here delyt
Then on here wyfes ben þay neuer so fayre
Ne neuer so trewe ne so debonaire
ffleissche is so newefongul wiþ meschance
That we ne konne in no þing han plesance
That sowneþ in to vertu eny while
This Phebus which þat þought vpon no gile
Desceyued was for alle his Iolite
ffor vnder him anoþer hadde sche
A man of litel reputacion
Nought worþ to Phebus in comparison
The more harm it is it happeþ ofte so
Of which þer comeþ mochil harme and wo
And so bifelle whan Phebus was absent
His wif anon haþ for hir lemman sent
  
Hire lemman certes þis is a kauissch speche
fforȝiueþ it me and þat I ȝou beseche
The wyse Plato saiþ as ȝe may rede
þe worde moot need acorde wiþ þe dede
ȝif men schal telle proprely a þing  
The word moot cosyn be to þe workyng
I am a boystous man riht þus say I
Ther is no difference trewely
Betwix a wyf þat is of heih degre
If of hire body dishoneste sche be
And a pouere wenche othir þan þis
If it so be þey werke boþe amys
But þat þe gentil is in staat aboue
Sche schal be cleped his lady as in loue
And for þat oþer is a pouer womman
Sche schal be cleped his wenche or his lemman
And god it woot myn owne deere broþer
Men leyn þat oon as lowe as liþ þat oþer
Right so betwixe a titles tyraunt
And an outlawe or a þeef erraunt
The same I say þer is no difference 
To alisaundre was tolde þis sentence 
That for þe tyraunt is of grettere might
By force of meyne for to sleen doun right
And brenne hous and home and make al playn
Lo þerfore is he cleped a Capitayn
 And for þe outlawe haþ but smal meigne
And may not doon so gret an harm as he
Ne bringe a Contre to so gret mescheef
Men clepen him an outlawe or a þeef
But for I am a man not texted wel
I wol not telle of Tytus neuer a deel
I wol go to my tale as I began
Whan Phebus  hadde sent for hire lemman
Anon þey wroughten alle here lust volage
This white crowe þat heng ay in þe kage
  
Bihelde hire werk and seyde neuer a word
And whan þat home was come Phebus þe lord
This crowe sange cokkow cokkow cokkow
What bryd quoþ Phebus what song syngest þou
Ne were þou wont so meryly to synge  
þat to myn herte it was a reioisschinge
To here þi voys allas what song is þis
By god quod he I synge nought amys
Phebus quod he for al þi worþinesse
ffor alle þy beaute and þyn gentilnesse
ffor alle þi song and al þi menstralcye
ffor al þi waytyng blered is þin ye
Wiþ on of litel reputacion
Nought worþ to þe as in comparison
þe mountance of a gnatte so mote I þriue
ffor on þy bed þy wyff  I say him swyue
What wole ȝe more þe crowe anon him tolde
By sadde tokenes and by wordes bolde
How þat his wyf hadde doon hire leccherie
him to gret schame and to gret vilanye
And tolde him ofte he say it wiþ his eyen
þis Phebus gan awayward for to wryen
him þought his sorwful herte brast a tuo 
His bowe he bente and sette þerInne a floo
And in his Ire þan haþ he his wif yslayn
This is þeffecte þer is nomore to sayn
ffor sorwe of which he brak his mynstralcye
Boþe harpe and lewte gyterne and Sawterye
And eek he brak his arwes and his bowe
And after þat þus spak he to þe crowe
Traytour quod he wiþ tonge of Scorpion
Thou hast me brought to my confusion
Allas þat I was wrought why nere I ded
O deere wyf o gemme of lustyhed
That were to me so sadde and eek so trewe
Now lyes þou deed wiþ face pale of hewe 
  
fful gulteles þat durst I swere ywys
O rakel hound to don so foule amys
O trouble witte O Ire recheles
That vnauysed smytest gulteles 
O wantruste ful of fals suspecion  
Where was þy witte and þi discrecion
O euery man be war of rekelnesse
Ne trowe noþing wiþouten strong witnesse
Smyt nouȝt to sone er þat þou wite why
And be auysed wel and soburly
Or ȝe doon eny execucion
Vpon ȝoure Ire for suspecion
Allas a þousand folk han rakel Ire
ffully fordoon or brought hem in þe myre
Allas for sorwe I wil my selue slee
And to þe crowe O false þeef sayde he
I wol þe quyte anon þy false tale
þou songe whilom lyk a nightyngale
Now schalt þou false þeef þi song forgon
Eeke þin white feþeres euerichon
Ne neuer in alle þi lyue schalt þou speke
Thus schal men on a traitour ben awreke
Thou and þin hospreinge euere schuln be blake
Ne neuere swete noyse schul ȝe make 
But euer crye agayn tempest and reyn
In toknyng þat þurgh þe my wyf was slayn
And to þe crowe he sterte and þat anon
And pulled his white feþeres euerychon
and made him blak and reft him alle his song
And eek his speche and out at þe dore him slong
vnto þe deuel which I him betake 
And for þis caas ben alle crowes blake
Lordynges by þis ensample I ȝou preye
Beþ war and takeþ keepe what þat ȝe seye
Ne telleþ neuer no man in ȝour lyff
how þat anoþer man haþ dight his wyf
  
He wole ȝow haten mortelly certein
Daun Salomon as wise clerkes sein
Techeþ a man to kepe his tonge wel
But as I sayde I am nought text wel
But naþeles þus taughte me my dame  
My sone þenk on þe crowe a goddes name
My sone keepe wel þi tonge and kepe þy frende
A wikked tonge is worse þan a feende
My sone ffrom a feend men may hem blesse
My sone god of his endeles goodnesse 
Walled a tonge wiþ teeþ and lippes eeke
ffor man schulde him auyse what he speeke
My sone ful ofte for to mochel speche
haþ many a man be spilt as clerkes teche
But for litel speche auysily
Is no man schent to speke generally
My sone þy tonge schuldest þou restreigne
At alle tyme but whan þou dost þy peyne
To speke of god in honour and preyere
The ferste vertu sone if þou wolt lere
Is to restreyne and kepe wel þi tunge
þus lernen children whanne þey ben ȝonge
My sone of mochel spekyng euel auysed
Ther lasse spekyng hadde ynough suffised
Comeþ mochil harm þus was me told and taught
In mochil speche synne wanteþ naught
Wostow wherof a rakil tonge serueþ
Right as a swerd forkutteþ and forkerueþ
An arm a tuo my deere sone right so
A tunge kutteþ frendschipe al a tuo
A ianglere is to god abhominable 
Rede Salamon so wys and honorable 
Rede Dauyd and his psalmys red senekke
My sone speek nought but wiþ þin heed þou bekke
Dissimule as þou were defe if þat þou heere
A Iangler speke of perilous mateere 
  
þe flemyng saiþ and lerne it if þe leste
þat lytel Iangelynge causeþ mechel reste
My sone if þou no wickede word hast seyd
þe þar nouȝt drede for to be bywreyd
But he þat haþ myssayd I dar wel sayn  
he may by no way clepe his word agayn
Thing þat is sayde is sayde and forþ it goþ
Though him repente or be him neuer so loþ
he is his þralle to whom þat he haþ sayd
A tale of which he is now yuele payd
My sone be war and be nouȝt auctour newe
Of tydynges wheþer þay ben fals or trewe
Wher so þou come amonges heihe or lowe
Kepe wel þy tunge and þenk vpon þe crowe
By þat þe maunciple hadde his tale ended
The sonne fro þe souþ syde is descended
So lowe þat he was nought to my sight
Degrees xxix as of highte 
Ten of þe clokke it was so as I gesse 
ffor xj foote a lytel more or lesse
My schadwe was at þilke tyme as þere 
Of suche feet as my lengþe parted were 
In six foote equal of proporcion
Therwiþ þe mones exaltacion
I mene libra alwey gan ascende
As we were entryng at a thropes ende
ffor wiþ oure Oste as he was wont to gye
As in þis caas oure ioly companye 
Sayde in þis wise lordynges euerychon
Now lakkeþ vs no tale more þan oon
ffulfild is my sentence and my degre
Who wile now telle a tale let se
Almost fulfilled is myn ordynaunce
I pray to god so ȝiue him right good chance
þat telleþ þis tale to vs lustely
Sire prest quod he art þou a vicary
Or art þou a person say soþ by þy fey
Be what þou be ne breke nought oure pley
  
ffor euery man saue þou haþ told his tale
vnbokele and schewe vs what is in þy male  
ffor trewely me þenkeþ by þy cheere
Thou scholdest knette vp wel a gret matiere
Telle vs a fable anon for cokkes bones
This person answered al at oones
Thou getest fable non ytolde for me
ffor Poule þat writeþ vnto Thimothe
Repreueþ hem þat wayuen soþfastnesse
And tellen fables and such wrecchednesse
Whi schulde I schewen draff out of my feste 
Whan I may schewen whete if þat me leste
ffor which I saye if þat þou luste to heere
Moralite and vertuous matiere
And þenne þat ȝe woln ȝiue me audience
I wol ful fayn at cristes reuerence 
Don ȝou plesaunce lefful as I can
But trusteþ wel I am a sothryn man
I can nought geste rom ram ruf by lettre
Ne god wot rym holde I but lytel bettre
And þerfore if ȝou luste I wol nought glose
I wol ȝou telle a mery tale in prose
To knitte vp al þis feste an ende
And ihesu for his grace witte me sende
To schewe ȝou þe wey in þis visage
Of þilke parfyt glorious pilgrimage
That highte Ierusalem Celestial
And if ȝe vouche sauf anon ȝe schal
Bygynne vpon my tale for which I preye
Telle ȝoure avis I can no bettre seye
But naþeles þis meditacion
I putte it ay vnder correction
Of clerkes for I am nought text wel
I take but þe sentence trustel wel
þerfore I make protestacion
That I wol stonde to correction
  
Vppon þis word we han assented sone

to enden  in som vertuous sentence
and for to yeve him space  and audience
and bad oure Oste  he shulde to him say
that alle we  to telle his tale him pray
oure Oste had the wordes  for vs alle
sir prest quod he  now faire yow befalle
sey what yow luste  and we wol gladly here
and with that worde  he seide in this manere
telleth quod he  youre meditacioun

and to do wel  god sende yow his grace
 Sire Nonnes preest oure hoost seyde a none

But be my trouthe if thou were seculere
Thow woldeste bene a tredefoul a right

Now sire faire falle yow for youre tale

and whan that he  had his sight agayne
ther was neuer man of thing  so fayne
but on his wiff  his thought was euermo

and saw how Damyan  his wiff had dressed
in suche manere  hit may not ben expressed
