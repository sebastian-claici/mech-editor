WHan that Auerylle with his shoures soote  
The droghte of March  hath perced to the roote
And bathed euery veyne in swich lycour
Of which vertu engendred is the flour
Whan zephirus eek with his sweete breeth
Inspired hath in euery holt and heeth
The tendre croppes  and the yonge sonne
Hath in the Ram  his half cours yronne
And smale foweles  maken melodye
That slepen al the nyght with open Iye
So priketh hem nature  in hir corages
Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrymages
And Palmeres for to seeken straunge strondes
To ferne halwes  kouthe in sondry londes
And specially  from euery shyres ende
Of Engelond  to Caunterbury they wende
The holy blisful martir  for to seke
That hem hath holpen whan þat they weere seeke
Bifel þat in that sesoun on a day
In Southwerk at the Tabard  as I lay
Redy to weenden  on my pilgrymage
To Caunterbury  with ful deuout corage
At nyght was come  in to that hostelrye
Wel xxix in a compaignye
Of sondry folk  by auenture yfalle
In felaweshipe  and pilgrymes weere they alle
That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde


The chambres and the stables  weeren wyde
And wel we weeren esed  at the beste
And shortly whan the sonne was to reste
So hadde I spoken with hem euerichoon
That I was of hir felaweshipe anoon
And maade forward  erly for to ryse  
To take oure wey  ther as I yow deuyse
 But nathelees  while I haue tyme and space
Er that I ferther  in this tale pace
Me thynketh it acordant to resoun
To telle yow  al the condicioun
Of eech of hem  so as it seemed me
And whiche they weere  and of what degree
And eek in what array  þat they weere Inne
And at a knyght thanne wol I first bigynne
 A knyght ther was  and that a worthy man
That fro the tyme  þat he first bigan
To ryden out he loued chiualrye
Trouthe and honour  fredom and curteisye
fful worthy was he  in his lordes werre
And ther to hadde he ryden  no man ferre
As wel in cristendom  as hethenesse
And euere honured  for his worthynesse
 At Alisaundre he was  whan it was wonne
fful ofte tyme  he hadde the bord bigonne
Abouen alle nacions  in Pruce
In lettow  hadde he reysed  and in Ruce
No cristen man so ofte  of his degree
In Gernade at the seege eek hadde he be
At Algizir  and ryden in Belmarye
At lyeys was he  and at Satalye
Whan they weere wonne  and in the grete see
At many a noble armee  hadde he bee
 At mortal batailles  hadde he been fiftene
And foghten for oure feyth  at Tramyssene
In lystes thryes  and ay slayn his foo


 This ilke worthy knyght hadde been also
Somtyme  with the lord of Palatye
Agayn another hethen in Turkye
And euere moore  he hadde a souereyn prys
And thogh þat he weere worthy  he was wys
And of his poort as meke  as is a mayde
Ne neuere yet no vileynye he sayde
In al his lyf vnto no manere wight
He was a verray perfit gentil knyght
But for to tellen yow  of his array  
Hise hors weere goode  but he ne was nat gay
Of ffustian  he wered a gypon
Al bismotered  with his haubergeon
ffor he was laate  comen from his viage
And wente  for to doon his pilgrymage
 With hym  ther was his sone a yong Squyer
A louere  and a lusty Bachiler
With lokkes crulle  as they weere leyd in presse
Of xx yeer  he was of age I gesse
Of his stature  he was of euene lengthe
And wonderly delyuere  and of greet strengthe
And he hadde been som tyme  in chiuachye
In fflaundres  in Artoys  and Picardye
And born hym wel  as in so litel space
In hope  to stonden  in his lady grace
 Embrouded was he  as it weere a meede
Al ful of fresshe floures  white and reede
Syngynge he was  or floytynge al the day
He was as fressh  as is the Monthe of May
Short was his gowne  with sleues  longe and wyde
Wel koude he sitte on hors  and faire ryde
He koude songes wel make  and endite
Iuste and eek daunce  and wel portreye and write
So hoote he loued  that by nyghtertale
He slepte namoore  than dooth a nyghtyngale
Curteys he was  lowely  and seruysable


And carf biforn his fader  at the table
 A Yeman he hadde  and seruantz namo
At that tyme  for hym liste ryde so
And he was clad  in coote and hood of greene
A sheef of Pecok arwes  bright and keene
Vnder his belt he bar ful thriftily
Wel koude he dresse his takel yemanly
His arwes drowped noght with fetheres lowe
And in his hand  he bar a myghty bowe
A not heed hadde he  with a broun visage
Of wodecraft  koude he wel al the vsage
Vp on his arm  he bar a gay bracer
And by his syde  a swerd and a Bokeler
And on that oother syde  a gay daggere  
Harneysed wel  and sharpe  as poynt of spere
A Cristofre on his brest of siluer sheene
An horn he bar  the bawdryk was of greene
A fforster was he  soothly as I gesse
 Ther was also  a Nonne a Prioresse
That of hir smylyng was ful symple and coy
Hir gretteste ooth  was but by Seint Loy
And she was clepyd  madame Eglentyne
fful wel she soong the seruyce dyuyne
Entuned in hir nose  ful semely
And frenssh she spak ful faire and fetisly
After the scole  of Stratford at the Bowe
ffor frenssh of Parys  was to hire vnknowe
At mete  wel ytaught was she with alle
She leet no morsel  from hir lyppes falle
Ne wette hir fyngres  in hir sauce deepe
Wel koude she carye a morsel  and wel keepe
That no drope  fille vp on hir brist
In curteisye  was set muchel hir list
Hir ouer lyppe  wyped she so cleene
That in hir coppe  ther was no ferthyng seene
Of grece  whan she dronken hadde hir draghte


fful semely  after hir mete she raghte
And sikerly  she was of greet desport
And ful plesaunt and amyable of port
And peyned hire  to countrefete chiere
Of Court and been estatlich of manere
And to been holden  digne of reuerence
But for to speken  of hir conscience
She was so charitable  and so pitous
She wolde wepe  if þat she sawe a Mous
Caught in a trappe  if it weere deed  or bledde
Of smale houndes  hadde she  þat she fedde
With rosted flessh  or mylk  and wastel breed
But soore wepte she  if oon of hem weere deed
Or if men smoot it  with a yerde smerte
And al was conscience  and tendre herte
fful semely  hir wympel pynched was
Hir nose tretez  hir eyen  greye as glas
Hir mouth ful smal  and ther to  softe and reed  
But sikerly  she hadde a fair forheed
It was almoost a spanne brood I trowe
ffor hardily  she was nat vndergrowe
fful fetys was hir cloke  as I was war
Of smal Coral  aboute hir arm she bar
A peyre of bedes  gauded al with greene
And ther on heeng a brooch of gold ful sheene
On which  was first writen  a crowned A
And after  amor vincit omnia
 Another Nonne  with hire hadde she
That was hire Chapeleyne  and preestes thre
 A Monk ther was  a fair for the maystrye
An outrydere  that louede venerye
A manly man  to been an Abbot able
fful many a deyntee hors  hadde he in stable
And whanne he rood  men myghte his brydel heere
Gyngle in a whistlynge wynd  as cleere
And eek as loude  as dooth the Chapel belle


There as this lord  is kepere of the selle
The rule of seint Maure  or of seint Beneyt
By cause þat it was oold  and som deel streyt
This ilke Monk  leet oolde thynges pace
And heeld  after the newe world the space
He yaf noght of that text a pulled hen
That seith  þat hunterys been none holy men
Ne þat a Monk whan he is recchelees
Is likned  til a fissh  þat is waterlees
This is to seyn  a Monk out of his Cloystre
But thilke text heeld he nat worth an Oystre
And I seyde  his opynyon was good
What sholde he studie  and make hym seluen wood
Vp on a book in Cloystre alwey to poure
Or swynke with his handes  and laboure
As Austyn bit how shal the world be serued
Lat Austyn heue his swynk to hym reserued
Ther fore  he was a prykasour aryght
Grehoundes he hadde  as swift as fowel in flyght
Of prikyng and of huntyng for the haare
Was al his lust for no cost wolde he spaare
I saugh his sleues  purfiled at the hond  
With grys  and that the fyneste of a lond
And for to festne his hood  vnder his chyn
He hadde  of gold  wroght a ful curious pyn
A loue knotte  in the gretter ende ther was
His heed was balled  that shoon as any glas
And eek his face  as he hadde been enoynt
He was a lord ful fat and in good poynt
Hise eyen steepe  and rollynge in his heed
That stemed  as a fourneys of a leed
Hise bootes souple  his hors  in greet estaat
Now certeynly  he was a fair prelat
He was nat paale  as is a forpyned goost
A fat swan  loued he  best of any roost
His palfrey  was as broun as any berye


 A frere ther was  a wantowne and a merye
A lymytour  a ful solempne man
In alle the ordres foure  is noon þat kan
So muche of daliaunce  and fair langage
He hadde maked  ful many a mariage
Of yonge wommen  at his owene cost
Vn to his ordre  he was a noble post
fful wel biloued  and famylier was hee
With ffrankeleyns  ouer al in his contree
And eek with worthy wommen  of the town
ffor he hadde  power of confessioun
As seyde him self  moore than a curaat
ffor of his ordre  he was licenciaat
fful swetely  herde he confessioun
And plesant was his absolucioun
He was an esy man  to yeue penaunce
Ther as he wiste  to haue a good pitaunce
ffor vn to a poure ordre  for to yeue
Is signe  that a man  is wel yshryue
ffor if he yaf he dorste make auaunt
He wiste  þat a man was repentaunt
ffor many a man  so hard is of his herte
He may nat weepe  thogh þat he soore smerte
Ther fore  in stede of wepynge  and preyeres
Men moote yeue siluer  to the poure freres
 His typet was ay farsed ful of knyues  
And pynnes  for to yeuen faire wyues
And certeynly  he hadde a murye noote
Wel koude he synge  and pleyen on a roote
Of yeddynges  he bar outrely the prys
His nekke whit was  as the flour delys
Ther to he stroong was  as a Champioun
He knew the tauernes wel in euery town
And euery hostiler  and Tappestere
Bet  than a lazer  or a beggestere
ffor vn to swich a worthy man  as he


Acorded nat  as by his facultee
To haue  with syke lazers aqueyntaunce
It is nat honeste  it may noght auaunce
ffor to deelen  with no swich poraille
But al with riche  and sellerys of vitaille
And ouer al  ther as profit sholde aryse
Curteys he was  and lowely of seruyse
Ther was no man  nowheer  so vertuous
He was the beste beggere  of his hous
And yaf a certeyn ferme  for the graunt
Noon of his bretheren  cam ther in his haunt
ffor thogh a wydwe  hadde noght a sho
So plesant was his In principio
Yet wolde he haue a ferthyng er he wente
His purchaas  was wel bettre than his rente
And rage he koude  as it weere right a whelpe
In louedayes  koude he muchel helpe
ffor there  he was nat lyk a Cloystrer
With a threedbare cope  as is a poure scoler
But he was lyk a maister  or a Pope
Of double worstede  was his semycope
And rounded as a belle  out of the presse
Somwhat he lypsed  for his wantownesse
To make his englyssh  sweete vp on his tonge
And in his harpyng whan þat he hadde songe
Hise eyen twynkled  in his heed aryght
As doon the sterres  in the frosty nyght
This worthy lymytour  was cleped Huberd
 A Marchant was ther  with a forked berd
In Motlee  and hye on hors he sat  
Vp on his heed  a fflaundryssh Beuere hat
His bootes clasped  faire and fetisly
Hise resons  he spak ful solempnely
Sownyng alway  thencrees of his wynnyng
He woolde  the see weere kept for any thyng
Bitwixen Myddelburgh  and Orewelle


Wel koude he  in eschaunge  sheeldes selle
This worthy man  ful wel his wit bisette
Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette
So estaatly was he  of his gouernaunce
With his bargaynes  and with his cheuysaunce
ffor soothe  he was a worthy man with alle
But sooth to seyn  I noot how men hym calle
 A Clerc ther was  of Oxenford also
That vn to logyk hadde longe ygo
As leene was his hors  as is a rake
And he was noght right fat I vndertake
But looked holwe  and ther to sobrely
fful threedbaare  was his ouereste Courtepy
ffor he hadde  geten hym yet no benefice
Ne was so worldly  for to haue office
For hym was leuere  haue at his beddes heed
Twenty bookes  clad  in blak  or reed
Of Aristotle  and his Philosophye
Than robes riche  or ffithele  or gay Sautrye
But al be  that he was a Philosophre
Yet hadde he  but litel gold in Cofre
But al that he myghte  of his frendes hente
On bookes  and on lernynge  he it spente
And bisily  gan for the soules preye
Of hem  that yaf hym  wher with to scoleye
Of studye  took he moost cure and moost heede
Noght oo word spak he  moore than was neede
And that was spoke  in forme  and reuerence
And short and quyk and ful of heigh sentence
Sownynge in moral vertu  was his speche
And gladly wolde he lerne  and gladly teche
 A Sergeaunt of lawe  waar  and wys
That often  hadde been at the Parvys
Ther was also  ful ryche of excellence  
Discreet he was  and of greet reuerence
He seemed swich  hise wordes weeren so Wyse


Iustice he was  ful often in Assise
By patente  and by pleyn commissioun
ffor his science  and for his heigh renoun
Of fees and robes  hadde he many oon
So greet a purchasour  was nowher noon
Al was fee symple  to hym  in effect
His purchasyng myghte nat been infect
Nowher so bisy a man as he  ther nas
And yet he seemed  bisyer than he was
In termes  hadde he caas  and doomes alle
That from tyme of kyng william  weere falle
Ther to  he koude endite  and make a thyng
Ther koude no wight pynchen at his writyng
And euery statut koude he pleyn by roote
He rood but hoomly  in a medlee coote
Girt with a ceynt of sylk with barres smale
Of his array  telle I no lenger tale
 A ffrankeleyn  was in his compaignye
Whit was his berd  as is the dayesye
Of his complexcion  he was sangwyn
Wel loued he by the morwe  a sope in wyn
To lyuen in delyt was euere his wone
ffor he was  Epicurus owene sone
That heeld opynyon  þat pleyn delit
Was verray  felicitee parfit
An housholdere  and that a greet was hee
Seint Iulyan he was  in his contree
His breed  his ale  was alweys after oon
A bettre envyned man  was neuere noon
With outen bake mete  was neuere his hous
Of fresshe fisshe  and flesshe  and that so plentevous
It snewed in his hous  of mete and drynke
Of alle deyntees  þat men koude bithynke
After  the sondry sesons  of the yeer
So chaunged he  his mete  and his soper
fful many a fat partrych  hadde he in Muwe


And many a breem  and many a luce in Stuwe
Wo was his Cook  but if his Sauce weere  
Poynaunt and sharpe  and redy al his geere
His table dormaunt in his halle alway
Stood redy couered  al the longe day
At sessions  ther was he  lord and sire
fful ofte tyme  he was knyght of the Shire
An Anlaas  and a Gipser  al of Sylk
Heeng at his girdel  whit as morne mylk
A Shirreue hadde he been  and Countour
Was nowheer  swich a worthy vauasour
 An haberdasshere  and a Carpenter
A Webbe  a Dyere  and a Tapycer
And they weere clothed alle  in oo lyueree
Of a solempne  and a greet fraternytee
fful fressh and newe  hir geere apyked was
Hir knyues weere chaped  noght with bras
But al with siluer  wroght ful clene and wel
Hir girdles  and hir pouches  euerydel
Wel seemed eech of hem  a fair Burgeys
To sitten in a yeldehalle  on a deys
Euerych  for the wisdom  þat he kan
Was shaply  for to been an Alderman
ffor catel  hadde they ynogh  and rente
And eek hir wyues  wolde it wel assente
And ellis certeyn  they weere to blame
It is ful fair  to been yclepyd madame
And goon to vigilies  al bifore
And haue a Mantel  realliche ybore
 A Cook they hadde with hem  for the nones
To boille the chiknes  with the Marybones
And poudre marchaunt tart and  Galyngale
Wel koude he knowe  a draghte of london ale
He koude rooste  and seethe  and broille  and frye
Maken Mortreux  and wel bake a pye
But greet harm was it as it thoughte me


That on his Shyne  a Mormal hadde he
ffor Blankmanger  that maade he with the beste
 A Shipman was ther  wonyng fer by weste
ffor aught I woot he was of Dertemouthe
He rood vp on a Rouncy  as he kouthe
In a gowne of faldyng to the knee  
A daggere hangynge on a laas  hadde he
Aboute his nekke  vnder his arm adown
The hoote Somer  hadde maad his hewe al brown
And certeynly  he was a good felawe
fful many a draghte of wyn  hadde he drawe
ffro Burdeuxward  whil þat the Chapman sleepe
Of nyce conscience  took he no keepe
If þat he faght and hadde the hyer hond
By watre he sente hem hoom  to euery lond
But of his craft to rekene wel his tydes
His stremys  and his daungers hym bisydes
His herberwe and his moone  his lodmenage
Ther was noon swich  from hulle to Cartage
Hardy he was  and wys to vndertake
With many a tempest hadde his beerd been shake
He knew alle the hauenes  as they weere
ffro Gootlond  to the cape of ffynysteere
And euery cryke  in Britaigne  and in Spaigne
His barge  yclepyd was the Mawdelayne
 With vs  ther was  a Doctour of Phisyk
In al this world  ne was ther noon hym lyk
To speken of Phisyk and of Surgerye
ffor he was grounded  in Astronomye
He kepte his pacient a ful greet deel
In houres  by his magyk natureel
Wel koude he fortunen  the ascendent
Of hise ymages  for his pacient
He knew the cause  of euery maladye
Weere it of hoot or coold  or moyste  or drye
And where it engendred  and of what humour


He was a verray  perfit practisour
The cause yknowe  and of his harm the roote
Anoon he yaf  the sike man his boote
 fful redy hadde he  hise Apothecaryes
To senden hym  his drogges  and his letuaryes
ffor eech of hem  maade oother for to wynne
Hir frendshipe  was noght newe to bigynne
Wel knew he  the oolde Esculapyus
And Discorides  and eek Rusus
Olde ypocras  Haly  and Galyen  
Serapion  Razis  and Avycen
Auerroys  Damascien  and Constantyn
Bernard  and Gatesden  and Gilbertyn
Of his diete  mesurable was hee
ffor it was  of no superfluytee
But of greet norissynge  and digestible
His studye  was but litel on the Bible
In sangwyn and in Pers  he clad was al
Lyned with Taffata  and with Sendal
And yet he was  but esy of dispence
He kepte  þat he wan in pestilence
ffor gold in Phisyk is a Cordial
Ther fore  he loued gold in special
 A good wyf was ther  of bisyde Bathe
But she was som del deef and that was scathe
Of clooth makynge  she hadde swich an haunt
She passed hem  of Ipres  and of Gaunt
In al the parysshe  wyf ne was ther noon
That to the offrynge  bifore hire sholde goon
And if ther dide  certeyn  so wrooth was shee
That she was  out of alle charitee
Hir Couerchiefes  ful fyne weere of grownd
I dorste swere  they weyeden ten pownd
That on a Sonday  weeren vp on hir heed
Hir hosen weeren  of fyn Scarlet reed
fful streyte yteyd  and shoes  ful moyste and newe


Boold was hir face  and fair and reed of hewe
She was a worthy womman  al hir lyue
Housbondes at chirche dore  she hadde fyue
With outen oother compaignye  in yowthe
But ther of  nedeth noght to speke as nowthe
And thries  hadde she been at Ierusalem
She hadde passed  many a straunge strem
At Rome she hadde been  and at Boloyne
In Galyce at Seint Iame  and at Coloyne
She koude muchel  of wandrynge by the weye
Gattothed was she  soothly for to seye
Vp on an Amblere  esily she sat
Ywympled wel  and on hir heed an hat
As brood as is  a Bokeler  or a Targe  
A foot mantel  aboute hir hypes large
And on hir feet a peyre of spores sharpe
In felaweshipe  wel koude she laughe and carpe
Of remedies of loue  she knew par chaunce
ffor she koude of that art the olde daunce
 A good man  was ther  of Religioun
And was a poure parson  of a toun
But riche he was  of holy thoght and werk
He was also  a lerned man a Clerk
That Cristes gospel  trewely wolde preche
His parisshens  deuoutly wolde he teche
Benygne he was  and wonder diligent
And in aduersitee  ful pacient
And swich he was proeued  ofte sythes
fful looth weere hym  to cursen for his tythes
But rather wolde he yeuen  out of doute
Vn to his poure parisshens aboute
Of his offrynge  and eek of his substaunce
He koude in litel thyng haue suffisaunce
Wyd was his parisshe  and houses fer a sonder
But he ne lafte noght for reyn ne thonder
In siknesse  nor in meschief to visite


The ferreste in his parisshe  muche and lyte
Vp on his feet and in his hond a staf
This noble ensample  to his sheep he yaf
That first he wroghte  and afterward he taughte
Out of the gospel  he tho wordes caughte
And this figure  he added eek ther to
That if gold ruste  what sholde Iren do
ffor if a preest be foul  in whom we truste
No wonder is  a lewed man to ruste
And shame it is  if a preest take keepe
A shiten shepherde  and a clene sheepe
Wel oghte a preest ensample for to yiue
By his clennesse  how þat his sheep sholde lyue
He sette noght his benefice to hyre
And leet his sheep  encombred in the Myre
And ran to London  vn to Seint Poules
To seeken hym  a Chauntrye for soules
Or with a breetherede  to been withhoolde  
But dwelte at hoom  and kepte wel his foolde
So þat the wolf ne maade it noght myscarye
He was a sheepherde  and noght a Mercenarye
And thogh he hooly weere  and vertuous
He was noght to synful men despitous
Ne of his speche  daungerous  ne digne
But in his techyng discreet and benygne
To drawen folk to heuene  with fairnesse
By good ensample  this was his bisynesse
But it weere  any persone obstynaat
What so he weere  of heigh  or lowe estaat
Hym wolde he snybben  sharply for the nonys
A bettre preest I trowe ther nowher noon ys
He wayted  after no pompe  and reuerence
Ne maked hym  a spyced conscience
But Cristes loore  and hise Apostles twelue
He taughte  but first he folwed it hym selue
 With hym ther was a Plowman  was his broother

That hadde ylad of donge  ful many a ffoother
A trewe swynkere  and a good was he
Lyuynge in pees  and perfit charitee
God loued he best with al his hoole herte
At alle tymes  thogh hym gamed  or smerte
And thanne his Neighebore  right as hym selue
He wolde thresshe  and ther to  dyke and delue
ffor Cristes sake  with euery poure wight
With outen hyre  if it laye in his myght
His tythes payde he  ful faire and wel
Bothe of his propre swynk and his catel
In a Tabard he rood  vp on a Mere
Ther was also  a Reue  and a Millere
A Somonour  and a Pardoner also
A Maunciple  and my self ther weere namo
 The Millere  was a stout carl  for the nones
fful byg he was  of brawen  and eek of bones
That proeued wel  for ouer al ther he cam
At wrastlynge  he wolde haue alwey the Ram
He was short shuldred  brood  a thikke knarre
Ther was no dore  that he noolde heue of harre
Or breke it at a rennynge  with his heed  
His beerd  as any sowe  or fox  was reed
And ther to brood  as thogh it weere a spaade
Vp on the cope right of his nose he haade
A werte  and ther on stood  a tuft of heerys
Reede  as the bristles  of a Sowes eerys
Hise nosethirles  blake weere and wyde
A swerd and a bokeler  baar he by his syde
His mouth as greet was  as a greet fourneys
He was a Ianglere  a Golyardeys
And that was moost of synne and harlotryes
Wel koude he stelen corn  and tollen thryes
And yet he hadde  a thombe of gold pardee
A whit coote  and a blew hood wered hee
A Baggepipe  wel koude he  blowe and sowne


And ther with al  he broghte vs out of towne
 A gentil Maunciple  was ther  of a Temple
Of which  Achatours myghte take exemple
ffor to been wyse  in byynge of vitaille
ffor wheither þat he payde  or took by taille
Algate he wayted so  in his achaat
That he was ay biforn  and in good staat
 Now is nat that of god  a ful greet grace
That swich a lewed mannes wit shal pace
The wysdom  of an heepe  of lerned men
Of Maistres hadde he mo  than thryes ten
That weeren of lawe  expert and curious
Of whiche  ther weere a dozeyne  in that hous
Worthy  to been stywardes  of rente  and lond
Of any lord  that is in Engelond
To make hym lyue  by his propre good
In honour dettelees  but if he weere wood
Or lyue as scarsly  as hym lyst desire
And able  for to helpen al a Shire
In any caas  that myghte falle or happe
And yet this Maunciple  sette hir aller cappe
 The Reue  was a sclendre coleryk man
His beerd was shaue  as neigh as euer he kan
His heer was by his eerys  ful rownd yshorn
His tope was dokked  lyk a preest byforn
fful longe weere hise legges  and ful leene  
Ylik a staf ther was no calf yseene
Wel koude he keepe  a Gerner and a Bynne
Ther was noon Auditour  koude on hym wynne
Wel wiste he  by the droghte and by the reyn
The yeldynge  of his seed  and of his greyn
His lordes sheepe  his neet  his dayerye
His swyn  his hors  his stoor  and his pultrye
Was hooly  in this Reues gouernynge
And by his couenant yaf the rekenynge
Syn that his loord  was twenty yeer of age


Ther koude no man  brynge hym in arrerage
Ther nas Baillyf hierde  nor oother hyne
That he ne knew  his sleyghte  and his couyne
They weere adrad of hym  as of the deeth
His wonyng was ful faire vp on an heeth
With greene trees  shadwed was his place
He koude bettre  than his lord purchace
fful riche  he was astoored pryuely
His lord  wel koude he plesen subtilly
To yeue  and leene hym  of his owene good
And haue a thank and yet a coote and hood
In youthe  he lerned hadde  a good Mister
He was a wel good wrighte  a Carpenter
This Reue sat vp on a wel good Stot
That was a Pomely gray  and highte Scot
A long Surcote of Pers  vp on he haade
And by his syde  he baar a rusty blaade
Of Northfolk was this Reue  of which I telle
Bisyde a town  men clepyn Baldeswelle
Tukked he was  as is a ffrere aboute
And euere he rood  the hyndreste of oure route
 A Somonour  was ther with vs  in that place
That hadde  a fyrreed Cherubynnes face
ffor Sawceflewm he was  with eyen narwe
And hoot he was  and lecherous as a Sparwe
With scaled browes blake  and pyled berd
Of his visage  children weere aferd
Ther nas quyk siluer  lytarge  ne Brymstoon
Borace  Ceruce  ne Oille of Tartre noon
Ne oynement that wolde clense and byte  
That hym myghte helpen  of his whelkes whyte
Nor of the knobbes  sittynge on his chekes
Wel loued he garlek oynons and eek lekes
And for to drynke strong wyn  reed as blood
Thanne wolde he speke  and crye as he were wood
    


    
A fewe termes hadde he  two  or thre
That he hadde lerned  out of som decree
No wonder is  he herde it al the day
And eek ye knowe wel  how þat a Iay
Kan clepen watte  as wel as kan the Pope
But who so koude  in oother thyng hym grope
Thanne hadde he spent al his philosophie
Ay Questio quid iuris wolde he crye
 He was a gentil harlot and a kynde
A bettre felawe  sholde men noght fynde
He wolde suffre  for a quart of wyn
A good felawe  to haue his concubyn
A twelf monthe  and excusen hym at the fulle
fful pryuely  a fynch eek koude he pulle
And if he foond owher  a good felawe
He wolde techen hym  to haue noon awe
In swich caas  of the Ercedeknes curs
But if a mannes soule  were in his purs
ffor in his purs  he sholde ypunysshed be
Purs is the Ercedeknes helle  seyde he
 But wel I woot he lyed right in dede
Of cursyng oghte ech gilty man  drede
ffor curs wol sle  right as assoillyng sauyth
And also  war hym of a significauit 
 In daunger hadde he  at his owene gyse
The yonge gerles  of the diocise
And knew hir conseil  and was al hir reed
A gerland  hadde he set vp on his heed
As greet as it were  for an Ale stake
A bokeler  hadde he maad hym of a cake
 With hym ther rood  a gentil Pardoner
Of Rouncyual  his freend  and his comper
That streight was comen  fro the Court of Rome
fful loude he soong com hyder loue to me
This Somonour baar to hym  a styf burdoun  

Was neuere trompe  of half so greet a soun
 This Pardoner  hadde heer  as yelow as wex
But smothe it heeng as dooth a stryke of flex
By ounces  henge his lokkes þat he hadde
And ther with  he his shuldres ouerspradde
But thynne it lay  by colpons oon and oon
But hood for Iolitee  wered he noon
ffor it was trussed vp  in his walet
Hym thoughte  he rood al of the newe Iet
Discheuele saue his cappe  he rood al bare
Swiche glarynge eyen  hadde he as an hare
A vernycle  hadde he sowed  vp on his cappe
His walet  biforn hym  in his lappe
Bretful of pardon  comen from Rome al hoot
A voys he hadde  as smal  as hath a Goot
No berd hadde he  ne neuere sholde haue
As smothe it was  as it were late yshaue
I trowe he were a geldyng or a Mare
But of his craft fro Berwyk in to Ware
Ne was ther  swich another Pardoner
ffor in his Male  he hadde a pilwe beer
Which þat he seyde  was oure lady veyl
He seyde he hadde  a gobet of the seyl
That seint Peter hadde  whan þat he wente
Vp on the see  til Ihesu Crist hym hente
He hadde a cros of laton  ful of stones
And in a glas  he hadde pigges bones
But with thise relykes  whan þat he foond
A poure parson  dwellyng vp on lond
Vp on a day  he gat hym moore moneye
Than þat the parson gat  in Monthes tweye
And thus  with feyned flaterye and Iapes
He made the parson  and the peple his apes
But trewely  to tellen at the laste
He was in chirche  a noble Ecclesiaste
Wel koude he  rede a lesson  and a Storie


But alderbest he soong an Offertorie
ffor wel he wiste  whan þat soong was songe
He moste preche  and wel affyle hys tonge
To wynne siluer  as he ful wel koude  
Ther fore he soong the muryerly and loude
 Now haue I toold yow  soothly in a clause
Thestaat  tharray  the nombre  and eek the cause
Why þat assembled was this compaignye
In Southwerk at this gentil hostelrye
That highte the tabard  faste by the belle
But now is tyme  to yow for to telle
How þat we baren vs  that ilke nyght
Whan we weere  in that hostelrye alyght
And after wol I telle  of oure viage
And al the remenant of oure pilgrymage
 But first I pray yow  of youre curteisye
That ye narette it  noght my vileynye
Though þat I pleynly speke  in this matere
To telle yow  hir wordes  and hir cheere
Ne thogh I speke  hir wordes proprely
ffor this ye knowen  also wel as I
Who so shal telle a tale  after a man
He moot reherce  as neigh as euere he kan
Euerich a word  if it be in his charge
Al speke he  neuer so rudeliche and large
Or ellis  he moot telle his tale vntrewe
Or feyne thyng or fynde wordes newe
He may noght spare  althogh he weere his brother
He moot as wel  seye o word  as another
Crist spak hym self ful brode in holy writ
And wel ye woot no vileynye is it
Ek Plato seith  who so kan hym rede
The wordes  mote be cosyn  to the dede
 Also I pray yow  to foryeue it me
Al haue I nat set folk  in hir degree
Here in this tale  as þat they sholde stonde


My wit is short ye may wel vnderstonde
 Greet cheere  made oure hoost vs euerichon
And to the souper  sette he vs anon
He serued vs  with vitaille  at the beste
Strong was the wyn  and wel to drynke vs leste
A semely man  oure hoost was with alle
ffor to been  a Marchal in an halle
A large man he was  with eyen stepe  
A fairer burgeys  was ther noon in Chepe
Boold of his speche  and wys  and well ytaught
And of manhode  hym lakked right naught
Eke ther to  he was right a murye man
And after souper  pleyen he bigan
And spak of murthe  amonges othere thynges
Whan þat we hadde maad oure rekenynges
And seyde thus  now lordes trewely
Ye been to me  right wel come hertely
ffor by my trouthe  if þat I shal nat lye
I seigh noght this yeer  so mury a compaignye
At ones in this herberwe  as is now
ffayn wolde I doon yow myrthe  wiste I how
And of a myrthe  I am right now bithoght
To doon yow ese  and it shal coste noght
 Ye goon to Caunterbury  god yow spede
The blisful Martir  quyte yow youre mede
And wel I woot as ye goon by the weye
Ye shapen yow  to talen and to pleye
ffor trewely  confort  ne murthe is noon
To ryde by the weye  domb as stoon
And ther fore  wol I maken yow desport
As I seyde erst and doon yow som confort
And if yow liketh alle  by oon assent
ffor to stonden  at my Iuggement
And for to werken  as I shal yow seye
Tomorwe  whan ye ryden by the weye
Now by my fader soule  þat is deed


But ye be murye  I wol yeue yow myn heed
Hoold vp youre hondes  with outen moore speche
 Oure conseil  was nat longe for to seche
Vs thoughte  it was nat worth  to make it wys
And graunted hym  with outen moore avys
And bade hym seye  his voirdit as hym leste
 Lordynges quod he  now herkneth for the beste
But taketh it noght I pray yow in desdeyn
This is the poynt to speken short and pleyn
That ech of yow  to shorte with oure weye
In this viage  shal tellen tales tweye
To Caunterburyward  I mene it so  
And homward  he shal tellen othere two
Of auentures  þat whilom haue bifalle
And which of yow  þat bereth hym best of alle
That is to seyn  that telleth in this cas
Tales of best sentence  and moost solas
Shal haue a Souper  at oure aller cost
Here in this place  sittynge by this post
Whan that we come agayn  fro Caunterbury
And for to make yow  the moore mury
I wol my self goodly wit yow ryde
Right at myn owene cost and be youre gyde
And who so wole  my Iuggement with seye
Shal paye  al that we spende by the weye
And if ye vouche sauf  þat it be so
Tel me anoon  with outen wordes mo
And I wol erly  shape me ther fore
 This thyng was graunted  and oure othes swore
With ful glad herte  and preyden hym also
That he wolde vouche sauf  for to do so
And that he wolde been  oure gouernour
And of oure tales  Iuge and reportour
And sette a souper  at a certeyn prys
And we wol ruled been  at his deuys
In heigh and logh  and thus by oon assent


We been acorded  to his Iuggement
And ther vp on  the wyn was fet anoon
We dronken  and to reste wente echon
With outen  any lenger taryynge
 A morwe  whan þat day bigan to sprynge
Vp roos oure hoost and was oure aller cok
And gadred vs  togydres in a flok
And forth we ryden  a litel moore than pas
Vn to the wateryng of Seint Thomas
And there oure hoost bigan his hors areste
And seyde  lordes  herkneth if yow leste
 Ye woot youre forward  and it yow recorde
If euensong  and morwesong acorde
Lat se now  who shal telle the firste tale
As euere mote I drynke wyn  or Ale
Who so be rebel  to my Iuggement  
Shal paye  for al  that by the wey is spent
Now draweth cut er þat we ferrer twynne
He which þat hath the shorteste  shal bigynne
 Sire knyght quod he  my mayster and my lord
Now draweth cut for that is myn acord
Cometh neer quod he  my lady Prioresse
And ye sire Clerc lat be your shamefastnesse
Ne studieth noght ley hond to  euery man
 Anoon to drawen  euery wight bigan
And shortly  for to tellen  as it was
Were it by auenture  or sort or cas
The sothe is this  the Cut fil to the knyght
Of which ful blithe and glad was euery wight
And telle he moste his tale  as was resoun
By forward  and by composicioun
As ye han herd  what nedeth wordes mo
And whan this goode man  sawgh þat it was
As he  þat wys was  and obedient
To kepe his forward  by his free assent
He seyde  syn I shal bigynne the game


What wel come be the Cut in goddes name
Now lat vs ryde  and herkneth what I seye
And with that word  we ryden forth oure weye
And he bigan  with right a murye cheere
His tale anoon  and seyde as ye may heere

Whilom  as olde stories tellen vs
Ther was a duc þat highte Theseus
Of Atthenes  he was lord and gouernour
And in his tyme  swich a conquerour
That gretter was ther noon vnder the sonne
fful many a riche contree  hadde he wonne
What with his wysdom  and his chiualrye
He conquered  al the regne of femenye
That whilom  was ycleped Scithia  
And wedded  the queene ypolita
And broghte hire hom with hym  in his contree
With muchel glorie  and greet solempnitee
And eek  hir yonge suster Emelye
And thus with victorie  and with melodye
Lete I this noble duc to Atthenes ryde
And al his hoost in armes hym bisyde
 And certes  if it nere to long to heere
I wolde haue toold  fully the manere
How  wonnen was the regne of ffemenye
By Theseus  and by his Chiualrye
And of the grete bataille  for the nones
Bitwixen Atthenes  and Amazones
And how assegeged was ypolita
The faire hardy queene of Scithia
And of the feste  þat was at hir weddynge
And of the tempest at hir hom comynge
But al that thyng  I moot as now forbere
I haue god woot  a large feeld to ere
And wayke  been the oxen in my plogh
The remenant of the tale  is long ynogh
I wol nat letten eek  noon of this route


Lat euery felawe  telle his tale aboute
And lat se now  who shal the souper Wynne
And ther I lefte  I wol ayein bigynne
This duc  of Whom I make mencion
Whanne he was come  almoost to the town
In al his wele  and in his mooste pryde
He was war  as he caste his eye asyde
Wher þat ther kneled  in the heighe weye
A compaignye of ladyes  tweye and tweye
Ech after oother  clad in clothes blake
But swich a cry and swich a wo they make
That in this world  nys creature lyuynge
That herde  swich another waymentynge
And of this cry  they nolde neuere stenten  
Til they  the reynes of his brydel henten
 What folk been ye  þat at myn hom comynge
Perturben so my feste  with cryynge
Quod Theseus  haue ye so greet envie
Of myn honour  that thus compleyne and crye
Or who hath yow mysboden  or offended
And telleth me  if it may been amended
And why þat ye  been clothed thus in blak
The eldeste lady  of hem alle spak
Whan she hadde swowned  with a deedly cheere
That it was routhe  for to seen and heere
 She seyde  lord  to whom ffortune hath yiuen
Victorie  and as a Conquerour to lyuen
Noght greueth vs youre glorie  and youre honour
But we biseken  mercy and socour
Haue mercy on oure wo  and oure distresse
Som drope of pitee  thurgh thy gentillesse
Vp on vs wrecched wommen  lat thow falle
ffor certes lord  ther is noon of vs alle
That she ne hath been  a duchesse  or a queene
Now be we caytyues  as it is wel seene
Thanked be ffortune  and hir false wheel


That noon estaat assureth to been weel
Now certes lord  to abiden youre presence
Heere in this temple  of the goddesse clemence
We haue been waytynge  al this fourtenyght
Now help vs lord  syth it is in thy myght
 I wrecche  which þat wepe and waille thus
Was whilom wyf  to kyng Cappaneus
That starf at Thebes  cursed be the day
And alle we  þat been in this array
And maken  al this lamentacioun
We losten alle oure housbondes  at that town
Whil þat the sege  ther aboute lay
And yet now  the olde Creon weylaway
That lord is now  of Thebes the Citee
ffulfild of Ire  and of Iniquitee
He for despit  and for his tyrannye
To doon  the dede bodyes vileynye
Of alle oure lordes  whiche þat been slawe  
Hath alle the bodyes  on an heepe ydrawe
And wol nat suffren hem  by noon assent
Neyther to been yburyed  nor ybrent
But maketh houndes  ete hem in despit
And with that word  with outen moore respit
They fillen gruf and cryden pitously
Haue  on vs wrecched wommen  som mercy
And lat oure sorwe  synken in thyn herte
 This gentil duc doun from his courser sterte
With herte pitous  whan he herde hem speke
Hym thoughte  þat his herte wolde breke
Whan he saugh hem  so pitous  and so maat
That whilom weren  of so greet estaat
And in hise armes  he hem alle vp hente
And hem conforteth  in ful good entente
And swoor his ooth  as he was trewe knyght
He wolde doon  so ferforthly his myght
Vp on the tiraunt Creon  hem to wreke


That al the peple of Grece  sholde speke
How Creon was  of Theseus yserued
As he þat hadde his deeth  ful wel disserued
And right anoon  with outen moore abood
His baner he desplayeth  and forth rood
To Thebesward  and al his oost bisyde
No neer Atthenes  wolde he go ne ryde
Ne take his ese  fully half a day
But onward in his wey  that nyght he lay
And sente anoon  ypolita the queene
And Emelye  hir yonge suster sheene
Vn to the town of Atthenes  to dwelle
And forth he ryt ther nys namoore to telle
 The rede statue of Mars  with spere and targe
So shyneth  in his white Baner large
That alle the feeldes  glitren vp and doun
And by his Baner  born was his penoun
Of gold ful ryche  in which ther was ybete
The Mynotaur  which þat he wan in Crete
 Thus ryt this duc thus ryt this conquerour
And in his oost  of Chiualrye the flour
Til þat he cam to Thebes  and alighte  
ffaire in a feeld  ther as he thoghte fighte
 But shortly  for to speken of this thyng
With Creon  which þat was of Thebes kyng
He faught and slow hym manly  as a knyght
In pleyn bataille  and putte the folk to flyght
And by assaut he wan the Citee after
And rente adoun  bothe wal  and sparre  and rafter
And to the ladyes  he restored agayn
The bones  of hir freendes  þat were slayn
To doon obsequies  as was tho the gyse
But it weere al to long for to deuyse
The grete clamour  and the waymentynge
That the ladyes made  at the brennynge
Of the bodies  and the grete honour


That Theseus  the noble Conquerour
Dooth to the ladys  whan they from hym wente
But shortly  for to telle is myn entente
 Whan þat this worthy duc this Theseus
Hath Creon slayn  and wonne Thebes thus
Stille in that feeld  he took al nyght his reste
And dide with al the  contree  as hym leste
 To ransake in the taas  of bodies dede
Hem for to strepe  of harneys  and of wede
The pilours  diden bisynesse  and cure
After the bataille  and disconfiture
And so bifel  in the taas they founde
Thurgh girt with many a greuous blody wownde
Two yonge knyghtes  liggynge by and by
Bothe in oon armes  wroght ful richely
Of whiche two  Arcita highte that oon
And that oother knyght highte Palamon
Nat fully quyk  ne fully deed they weere
But by hir Cote armures  and by hir geere
The heraudes  knewe hem best in special
As they þat weren  of the blood roial
Of Thebes  and of sustren two yborn
Out of the taas  the pilours han hem torn
And han hem caryed  softe vn to the tente
Of Theseus  and he ful soone hem sente
To Atthenes  to dwellen in prison  
Perpetuelly  he nolde no raunson
 And whan this worthy duc  hath thus ydoon
He took his oost  and hom he ryt anoon
With laurer corouned  as a conquerour
And there he lyueth  in ioye  and in honour
Terme of his lyf  what nedeth wordes mo
And in a tour  in angwissh and in wo
Dwellen this Palamon  and eek Arcite
ffor euere moore  ther may no gold hem quyte
 This passeth yeer by yeer  and day by day


Til it fil ones  in a morwe of May
That Emelye  þat fairer was to seene
Than is the lilie  vp on his stalke greene
And fressher than the May  with floures newe
ffor with the Rose colour stroof hir hewe
I noot which was  the fairer of hem two
Er it were day  as was hir wone to do
She was arysen  and al redy dight
ffor May wol haue  no slogardye a nyght
The seson pryketh  euery gentil herte
And maketh it out of his sleep to sterte
And seith arys  and do thyn obseruance
This maketh Emelye  haue remembrance
To doon honour to May  and for to ryse
Yclothed was she fressh  for to deuyse
Hir yelow heer  was broyded in a tresse
Bihynde hir bak a yerde long I gesse
And in the gardyn  at the sonne vp riste
She walketh vp and doun  and as hir liste
She gadreth floures  party white and rede
To make a subtil gerland for hir hede
And as an Aungel  heuenysshly she soong
 The grete tour  þat was so thikke and strong
Which of the Castel  was the chief dongeon
Ther as the knyghtes  weren in prison
Of whiche I tolde yow  and tellen shal
Was euene ioynant  to the gardyn wal
Ther as this Emelye  hadde hir pleyyng
Bright was the sonne  and cleer  in that mornyng
And Palamon  this woful prisoner  
As was his wone  by leue of his Gailler
Was risen  and romed in a chambre an heigh
In which  he al the noble Citee seigh
And eek the gardyn  ful of braunches greene
Ther as  the fresshe Emelye the sheene
Was in hir walk  and romed vp and down


This sorweful prisoner  this Palamon
Gooth in the chambre  romyng to and fro
And to hym self  compleynyng of his wo
That he was born  ful ofte he seyde allas
And so bifel  by auenture  or cas
That thurgh a wyndow  thikke of many a barre
Of Iren greet and square as any sparre
He caste his eye  vp on Emelya
And ther with al he bleynte  and cryde A
As thogh  he stongen weere  vn to the herte
 And with that cry  Arcite anoon vp sterte
And seyde cosyn myn  what eyleth thee
That art so pale  and deedly on to see
Why cridestow  who hath thee doon offence
ffor goddes loue  tak al in pacience
Oure prison  for it may noon oother be
ffortune hath yeuen vs this aduersitee
Som wikked aspect or disposicion
Of Saturne  by som constellacion
Hath yeuen vs this  al thogh we hadde it sworn
So stood the heuene  whan þat we were born
We mote endure it this is the short and playn
This Palamon answerde  and seyde agayn
 Cosyn for sothe  of this opinion
Thow hast a vayn ymaginacion
This prison  caused me noght to crye
But I was hurt right now  thurgh out myn Iye
In to myn herte  that wol my bane be
The fairnesse  of that lady þat I se
Yond in the gardyn  romen to and fro
Is cause  of al my cryyng and my wo
I noot wher she be womman  or goddesse
But Venus  is it soothly as I gesse
And ther with al  on knees down he fil  
And seyde  Venus if it be thy wil
Yow in this gardyn  thus to transfigure


Bifore me  sorweful wrecched creature
Out of this prison  help þat we may scape
And if so be  my destynee be shape
By eterne word  to dyen in prison
Of oure lynage  haue som compassion
That is so lowe ybroght by tirannye
 And with that word  Arcite gan espye
Where as this lady  romed to and fro
And with that sighte  hir beautee hurte hym so
That if þat Palamon  was wounded soore
Arcite is hurt as muche as he  or moore
And with a syk  he seyde pitously
The fresshe beautee  sleeth me sodeynly
Of hire  þat rometh in the yonder place
And but I haue  hir mercy  and hir grace
That I may seen hire  at the leeste weye
I nam but deed  ther nys namoore to seye
 This Palamon  whan he tho wordes herde
Despitously he loked  and answerde
Wheither seistow this  in ernest or in pley
 Nay quod Arcite  in ernest by my fey
God help me so  me list ful yuele pleye
This Palamon  gan knytte his browes tweye
 It were to thee quod he  no greet honour
ffor to be fals  ne for to be traytour
To me  that am thy cosyn and thy brother
Ysworn ful depe  and ech of vs til oother
That neuere  for to dyen in the peyne
Til þat the deeth  departe shal vs tweyne
Neither of vs  in loue to hyndre oother
Ne in noon oother caas  my leeue brother
But þat thow sholdest trewely forthre me
In euery caas  and I shal forthren thee
This was thyn ooth  as myn also certeyn
I woot right wel  thow darst it nat withseyn
Thus artow of my conseil  out of doute


And now  thow woldest falsly been aboute
To loue my lady  whom I loue and serue  
And euere shal  til þat myn herte sterue
Now certes false Arcite  thow shalt nat so
I loued hire first and tolde thee my wo
As to my conseil  and my brother sworn
To forthre me  as I haue told biforn
ffor which  thow art ybounden  as a knyght
To helpe me  if it laye in thy myght
Or ellis artow fals  I dar wel sayn
This Arcite  ful proudly spak agayn
 Thow shalt quod he  be rather fals than I
And thow art fals  I telle thee outrely
ffor paramour  I loued hire first er thow
What wiltow seyn  thow woost nat yet now
Wheither she be a womman  or goddesse
Thyn is  affeccion of holynesse
And myn is loue  as to a creature
ffor which  I tolde thee myn auenture
As to my cosyn  and my brother sworn
I pose  that thow louedest hire biforn
Wostow nat wel  the olde clerkes sawe
That who shal  yeue a louere any lawe 
Loue is a gretter lawe  by my pan
Than may be yeue  to any erthely man
And therfore  posityf lawe  and swich decree
Is broke al day for loue  in ech degree
A man moot nedes loue  maugree his heed
He may nat fleen it  thogh he sholde be deed
Al be she mayde  wydwe  or ellis wyf
And eek it is nat likly  al thy lyf
To stonden in hir grace  namoore shal I
ffor wel thow woost thy self verraily
That thow and I  been dampned to prison
Perpetuelly  vs gayneth no raunson
We stryue  as dide the houndes for the boon


They foghte alday  and yet hir part was noon
Ther cam a kyte  whil þat they were so wrothe
That bar awey the boon  bitwix hem bothe
And therfore  at the kynges court my brother
Ech man for hym self  ther is noon oother
Loue if thee lest for I loue  and ay shal  
And soothly  leue brother this is al
Heere in this prison  moote we endure
And euerich of vs  take his auenture
 Greet was the stryf  and long bitwix hem tweye
If þat I hadde leyser for to seye
But to theffect  it happed on a day
To telle it yow  as shortly as I may
A worthy duc þat highte Parotheus
That felawe was  vn to duc Theseus
Syn thilke day  þat they were children lyte
Was come to Atthenes  his felawe to visite
And for to pleye  as he was wont to do
ffor in this world  he loued no man so
And he loued hym  as tendrely agayn
So wel they loued  as olde bookes sayn
That whan þat oon was deed  soothly to telle
His felawe wente  and soghte hym down in helle
But of that storie  list me noght to write
Duc Perotheus  loued wel Arcite
And hadde hym knowe at Thebes  yeer oy yere
And finally  at requeste and prayere
Of Perotheus  with outen any raunson
Duc Theseus  hym leet out of prison
ffrely to goon  wher þat hym liste ouer al
In swich a gyse  as I yow tellen shal
This was the forward  pleynly for tendite
Bitwixe Theseus  and hym Arcite
That if so weere þat Arcite weere yfounde
Euere in his lyf  by day  or nyght or stounde
In any contree  of this Theseus


And he weere caught it was acorded thus
That with a swerd  he sholde lese his heed
Ther nas noon oother  remedye ne reed
But taketh his leue  and homward he hym spedde
Lat hym be war  his nekke lyth to wedde
 How greet a sorwe  suffreth now Arcite
The deeth he feeleth  thurgh his herte smyte
He wepeth  wayleth  cryeth pitously
To sleen hym self  he wayteth pryuely
He seyde allas  the day þat I was born  
Now is my prison  worse than biforn
Now is me shape  eternally to dwelle
Noght in purgatorie  but in helle
Allas  þat euere knew I Parotheus
ffor ellis  hadde I dwelled with Theseus
Yfettred in his prison eueremo
Thanne hadde I been in blisse  and nat in wo
Oonly the sighte of hire  whom þat I serue
Thogh þat I neuere  hir grace may disserue
Wolde haue suffised  right ynogh for me
 O deere cosyn  Palamon  quod he
Thyn is the victorie  of this auenture
fful blisfully in prison maystow dure
In prison  nay certes  but in paradys
Wel hath ffortune  yturned thee  the dys
That hast the sighte of hire  and I thabsence
ffor possible is  syn thow hast hire presence
And art a knyght a worthy and an able
That by som caas  syn ffortune is chaungeable
Thow mayst to thy desir  som tyme atteyne
But I  that am exiled and bareyne
Of alle grace  and in so greet despeyr
That ther nys Erthe  water  fyr  ne Eyr
Ne creature  that of hem maked is
That may me helpe  or do confort in this
Wel oghte I sterue  in wanhope  and distresse


ffarwel my lyf  my lust and my gladnesse
 Allas why pleynen folk so  in commune
On purueiance of god  or of ffortune
That yeueth hem ful ofte  in many a gyse
Wel bettre  than they kan hem self deuyse
 Som man desireth  for to haue richesse
That cause is ofte  of his moerdre  or gret siknesse
And som man wolde  out of his prison fayn
That in his hous  is of his meynee slayn
Infinite harmes  been in this matere
We woot nat what thyng þat we prayen heere
We fare as he  þat dronke is as a Mous
A dronke man woot wel  he hath an hous
But he noot  which the righte wey is thider  
And to a dronke man  the wey is slider
And certes  in this world  so faren we
We seken faste  after felicitee
But we goon wrong ful ofte trewely
Thus may we seyn alle  and nameliche I
That wende  and hadde a greet opinion
That if I myghte  scapen fro prison
Thanne hadde I been in ioye  and parfit heele
Ther now  I am exiled fro my wele
Syn þat  I may nat seen yow Emelie
I nam but deed  ther nys no remedie
 Vp on that oother syde Palamon
Whan þat he wiste  Arcite was agon
Swich sorwe he maketh  þat the grete tour
Resowneth  of his yowlyng and clamour
The pure fettres  of his shynes grete
Were  of his bittre salte teeris wete
Allas quod he  Arcita cosyn myn
Of al oure stryf  god woot the fruyt is thyn
Thow walkest now  in Thebes at thy large
And of my wo  thow yeuest litel charge
Thow maystt syn thow hast wisdom  and manhede


Assemblen  al the folk of oure kynrede
And make a werre  so sharp  on this Citee
That by som auenture  or som tretee
Thow mayst haue hire  to lady and to wyf
ffor whom  þat I moste nedes lese my lyf
ffor as by wey  of possibilitee
Sith thow art at thy large  of prison free
And art a lord  greet is thyn auantage
Moore than is myn  that sterue here in a cage
ffor I moot wepe  and waille whil I lyue
With al the wo  þat prison may me yeue
And eek with peyne  þat loue me yeueth also
That doubleth  al my torment and my wo
Ther with  the fyr of Ialousie vp sterte
With Inne his brest and hente hym by the herte
So woodly  þat he lyk was to byholde
The Boxtree  or the Asshen dede  and colde
 Thanne seyde he  o crewel goddes  þat gouerne  
This world  with byndyng of youre word eterne
And writen  in the table of Atthamant
Youre parlement  and youre eterne grant
What is man kynde  moore vn to yow holde
Than is the sheepe  þat rowketh in the folde
ffor slayn is man  right as another beest
And dwelleth eek in prison and arrest
And hath siknesse  and greet aduersitee
And ofte tymes  giltlees pardee
 What gouernance  is in this prescience
That giltlees  tormenteth Innocence
And yet encreeceth this  al my penance
That man is bounden  to his obseruance
ffor goddes sake  to letten of his wille
Ther as a beest may al his lust fulfille
And whan a beest is deed  it hath no peyne
But man after his deeth  moot wepe and pleyne
Thogh in this world  he haue care and wo


With outen doute  it moot stonden so
The answere of this  lete I to diuynys
But wel I woot þat in this world  greet pyne is
 Allas  I se a serpent or a theef
That many a trewe man  hath doon mescheef
Goon at his large  and where hym lust may turne
But I moot been in prison  thurgh Saturne
And eek thurgh Juno  Ialous  and eek wood
That hath destroyed  wel neigh al the blood
Of Thebes  with his waste walles wyde
And Venus  sleeth me  on that oother syde
ffor Ialousie  and feere  of hym Arcite
 Now wol I stynte  of Palamon alite
And lete hym  in his prison stille dwelle
And of Arcita  forth I wol yow telle
 The Somer  and the nyghtes longe
Encreecen  double wise  the peynes stronge
Bothe of the louere  and the prisoner
I noot which hath  the sorwefuller myster
ffor soothly for to seyn  this Palamon
Perpetuelly  is dampned to prison
In cheynes  and in fettres  to been deed  
And Arcite  is exiled  vp on his heed
ffor euere mo  as out of that contree
Ne neueremo  ne shal his lady see
 Yow loueris  axe I now  this question
Who hath the worse  Arcite  or Palamon
That oon may seen his lady  day by day
But in prison  moot he dwelle alwey
That oother where hym list may ride or go
But seen his lady  shal he neuere mo
Now demeth as yow list ye þat kan
ffor I wol telle forth  as I bigan


 Whan þat Arcite  to Thebes comen was
fful ofte a day  he swelte  and seyde allas
ffor seen his lady  shal he neuere mo
And shortly  to concluden al his wo
So muchel sorwe  hadde neuere creature
That is or shal  whil þat the world may dure
 His sleepe  his mete  his drynke  is hym biraft
That leene he weex  and drye as is a shaft
Hise eyen holwe  and grisly to biholde
His hewe falow  and pale as asshen colde
And solitarie he was  and euere alloone
And waillynge al the nyght makynge his moone
And if he herde  soong or Instrument
Thanne wolde he wepe  he myghte nat be stent
So feble eek were his spiritz  and so lowe
And chaunged so  þat no man koude knowe
His speche  nor his voys  thogh men it herde
And in his gere  for al the world he ferde
Nat oonly  lyk the loueris maladye
Of Hereos  but rather lyk Manye
Engendred  of humour malencolyk
Biforn his Celle fantastyk
And shortly  turned was  al vp so down
Bothe habit and eek disposicioun
Of hym  this woful louere daun Arcite
 What sholde I al day  of his wo endite
Whanne he endured hadde  a yeer  or two
This cruel torment and this peyne and wo
At Thebes in his contree  as I seyde  
Vp on a nyght in sleep  as he hym leyde
Hym thoughte  how þat the wynged god Mercurye
Biforn hym stood  and bad hym to be murye
His slepy yerde  in honde he bar vp righte
An hat he wered  vp on his herys brighte


Arrayed was this god  as he took keepe
As he was  whan þat Argus took his sleepe
And seyde hym thus  to Atthenes shaltow wende
Ther is thee shapen  of thy wo an ende
 And with that word  Arcite wook and sterte
Now trewely  how sore þat me smerte
Quod he  to Atthenes right now wol I fare
Ne for the drede of deeth  shal I nat spare
To se my lady  þat I loue and serue
In hir presence  I recche nat to sterue
 And with that word  he caughte a greet Mirour
And saugh  þat chaunged was al his colour
And saugh his visage  al in another kynde
And right anoon  it ran hym in his mynde
That sith his face  was so disfigured
Of maladie  the which he hadde endured
He myghte wel  if þat he bar hym lowe
Lyue in Atthenes  eueremoore vnknowe
And seen his lady  wel ny  day by day
And right anoon  he chaunged his array
And cladde hym  as a poure laborer
And al allone  saue oonly a Squyer
That knew his pryuetee  and al his cas
Which was disgised  pourely as he was
To Atthenes  is he goon  the nexte way
And to the Court he wente vp on a day
And at the gate  he profreth his seruyse
To drugge and drawe  what so men wol deuyse
 And shortly  of this matere  for to seyn
He fil in office  with a Chambreleyn
The which  þat dwellyng was with Emelye
ffor he was wys  and koude soone espye
Of euery seruant which þat serueth here
Wel koude he  hewen wode  and water bere
ffor he was yong and myghty for the nones  
And ther to  he was strong and byg of bones


To doon  what any wight kan hym deuyse
A yeer  or two  he was in this seruyse
Page of the chambre  of Emelie the brighte
And Philostrate  he seyde þat he highte
 But half so wel biloued a man  as he
Ne was ther neuere in Court of his degree
He was so gentil  of condicion
That thurgh out al the Court was his renon
They seiden  þat it were a charitee
That Theseus  wolde enhauncen his degree
And putten hym  in worshipful seruyse
Ther as he myghte  his vertu exercise
And thus with Inne a while  his name is spronge
Bothe of his dedes  and his goode tonge
That Theseus  hath taken hym so ner
That of his chambre  he made hym a Squier
And gaf hym gold  to mayntene his degree
And eek men broghte hym  out of his contree
ffro yeer to yeer  ful pryuely his rente
But honestly  and sleighly  he it spente
That no man wondred  how þat he it hadde
And thre yeer in this wise  his lyf he ladde
And bar hym so  in pees  and ek in werre
Ther was no man  that Theseus hath derre
And in this blisse  lete I now Arcite
And speke I wole  of Palamon alite
 In derknesse  and horrible  and strong prison
This seuen yeer  hath seten Palamon
fforpyned  what for wo  and for distresse
Who feeleth  double soor  and heuynesse
But Palamon  that loue destreyneth so
That wood out of his wit he gooth for wo
And eek ther to  he is a prisoner
Perpetuelly  nat oonly for a yer
Who koude ryme  in englissh proprely
His martirdom  for sothe it am noght I


Ther fore I passe  as lightly  as I may
 It fil  þat  in that Seuenthe yeer of May
The thridde nyght as olde bokes seyn  
That al this storie  tellen moore pleyn
Were it by auenture  or destynee
As whan a thyng is shapen  it shal be
That soone after the mydnyght Palamon
By helpyng of a freend  brak his prison
And fleeth the Citee  faste as he may go
ffor he hadde yeue  his Gailler drynke so
Of a Clarree  maad of certeyn wyn
With Nercotikes  and opye  of Thebes fyn 
That al that nyght thogh þat men wolde hym shake
The Gailler sleepe  he myghte noght awake
 And thus he fleeth  as faste as euere he may
The nyght was short and faste by the day
That nedes cost he moste hym seluen hyde
And til a groue  faste ther bisyde
With dreedful foot thanne stalketh Palamon
ffor shortly  this was his opynyon
That in that groue  he wolde hym hyde al day
And in the nyght thanne wolde he take his way
To Thebesward  his freendes for to preye
On Theseus  to helpe hym to werreye
And shortly  outher he wolde lese his lyf
Or wynnen Emelie  vn to his wyf
This is theffect and his entente pleyn
 Now wol I turne  to Arcite ageyn
That litel wiste  how neigh þat was his care
Til þat ffortune  hadde broght hym  in the snare
 The bisy larke  messager of day
Salueth in hir song the morwe gray
And firy Phebus  riseth vp so brighte
That al the Orient laugheth of the lighte
And with his stremes  dryeth in the greues
The siluer dropes  hangynge on the leues


And Arcita  that in the Court roial
With Theseus  Squyer principal
Is risen  and looketh on the murye day
And for to doon  his obseruance to May
Remembrynge  on the point of his desir
He on a Courser  startlynge as the fir
Is riden in to the feldes  hym to pleye  
Out of the Court were it a myle  or tweye
And to the groue  of which þat I yow tolde
By auenture  his wey he gan to holde
To maken hym  a gerland of the greues
Were it of wodebynde  or hawethorn leues
And loude he soong ayein the sonne shene
May  with alle thy floures  and thy grene
Wel come be thow  faire fresshe May
In hope  þat I som grene gete may
And from his courser  with a lusty herte
In to the groue  ful hastily he sterte
And in a path  he rometh vp and doun
Ther as by auenture  this Palamon
Was in a bussh  þat no man myghte hym se
ffor soore afered  of his deeth was he
No thyng knew he  þat it was Arcite
God woot he wolde haue trowed it ful lite
But sooth is seyd  go sithen many yeris
That feeld hath eyen  and the wode hath erys
It is ful fair  a man to bere hym euene
ffor alday meeten men  at vnset steuene
fful litel woot Arcite  of his felawe
That was so neigh  to herknen al his sawe
ffor in the bussh  he sitteth now ful stille
 Whan þat Arcite  hadde romed al his fille
And songen al the roundel lustily
In to a studie  he fil sodeynly
As doon thise louerys  in hir queynte gerys
Now in the crope  now down in the brerys


Now vp  now down  as boket in a welle
Right as the friday  soothly for to telle
Now it shyneth  now it reyneth faste
Right so  kan gery Venus ouercaste
The hertes of hir folk right as hir day
Is gerful  right so chaungeth she array
Selde is the friday  al the wike ylike
 Whan þat Arcite hadde songe  he gan to syke
And sette hym down  with outen any moore
Allas quod he  that day  þat I was bore
How longe Iuno  thurgh thy crueltee  
Woltow werreyen  Thebes the Citee
Allas  ybroght is to confusion
The blood roial  of Cadme and Amphion
 Cadmus  which þat was the firste man
That Thebes bulte  and first bigan
And of the Citee  first was crowned kyng
Of his lynage am I  and his ofspryng
By verray ligne  as of the stok roial
And now I am  so caytyf and so thral
That he þat is  my mortal enemy
I serue hym  as his Squyer pourely
And yet dooth Iuno  me wel moore shame
ffor I dar noght biknowe myn owen name
But ther as I was wont to highte Arcite
Now highte I Philostrate  noght worth a myte
 Allas thow felle Mars  allas Juno
Thus hath youre Ire  oure lynage al fordo
Saue oonly me  and wrecchid Palamon
That Theseus  martireth in prison
And ouer al this  to sleen me outrely
Loue hath his firy dart so brennyngly
Ystiked  thurgh my trewe careful herte
That shapen was my deeth  erst than my sherte
Ye sleen me with youre eyen  Emelye
Ye been the cause  wherfore þat I dye


Of al the remenant of myn oother care
Ne sette I noght the mountaunce of a tare
So þat I koude doon aught to youre plesaunce
And with that word  he fil down in a traunce
A longe tyme  and afterward he vp sterte
 This Palamon  that thoughte  þat thurgh his herte
He felte a coold swerd  sodeynly glyde
ffor Ire he quook no lenger wolde he byde
And whan þat he had herd  Arcites tale
As he were wood  with face deed and pale
He stirte hym vp  out of the buskes thikke
And seyde Arcite  false traytour wikke
Now artow hent that louest my lady so
ffor whom þat I haue  al this peyne and wo
And art my blood  and to my conseil sworn  
As I ful ofte  haue toold thee her biforn
And hast byiaped here  duc Theseus
And falsly  chaunged hast thy name thus
I wol be deed  or ellis thow shalt dye
Thow shalt noght  loue my lady Emelye
But I wol loue hire oonly  and namo
ffor I am Palamon  thy mortal foo
And thogh þat I  no wepne haue in this place
But out of prison  am astert by grace
I drede noght þat outher thow shalt dye
Or thow ne shalt noght louen Emelye
Chees which thow wolt or thow shalt noght asterte
 This Arcite  with ful despitous herte
Whan he hym knew  and hadde his tale herd
As fiers as leon  pulled out his swerd
And seyde thus  by god þat sitteth aboue
Nere it þat thow art syk and wood for loue
And eek þat thow  no wepne hast in this place
Thow sholdest neuere  out of this groue pace
That thow ne sholdest dyen of myn hond
ffor I diffye  the seuretee and the bond


Which þat thow seist þat I haue maad to thee
What verray fool  thynk wel þat loue is free
And I wol loue hire  maugree al thy myght
 But for as muche  as thow art a worthy knyght
And wilnest to darreyne hire by bataille
Haue here my trouthe  tomorwe I nyl nat faille
With outen wityng of any oother wight
That here  I wol be founden  as a knyght
And bryngen harneys  right ynogh for thee
And chees the beste  and leef the worste to me
And mete and drynke  this nyght wol I brynge
Ynogh for thee  and clothes for thy beddynge
And if so be  þat thow my lady wynne
And sle me in this wode  ther I am Inne
Thow mayst wel haue thy lady  as for me
 This Palamon answerde  I graunte it thee
And thus they been departed  til amorwe
Whan ech of hem  hadde leyd his feith to borwe
O Cupide  out of alle charitee  
O regne  that wolde no felawe haue to thee
fful sooth is seyd  þat loue ne lordshipe
Wol noght his thankes  haue no felaweshipe
Wel fynden that Arcite and Palamon
 Arcite  is riden anoon  vn to the town
And on the morwe  er it were dayes lyght
fful priuely  two harneys hath he dyght
Bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyne
The bataille in the feeld  bitwix hem tweyne
And on his hors  allone  as he was born
He carieth al this harneys  hym biforn
And in the groue  at tyme and place yset
This Arcite  and this Palamon been met
 To chaungen  gan the colour in hir face
Right as the hunterys  in the regne of Trace
That stonden at the gappe  with a spere
Whanne hunted is  the leon or the Bere


And hereth hym  come russhynge in the greues
And breketh  bothe bowes  and the leues
And thynketh  here cometh my mortal enemy
With oute faille  he moot be deed  or I
ffor outher  I moot sleen hym  at the gappe
Or he moot sle me  if þat me myshappe
So ferden they  in chaungyng of hir hewe
As fer  as euerich  oother of hem knewe
 Ther nas no good day  ne no saluynge
But streight with outen word  or rehersynge
Euerich of hem  heelp for to armen oother
As frendly  as he weere  his owene brother
And after that  with sharpe speres stronge
They foynen  ech at oother  wonder longe
Thou myghtest wene  þat this Palamon
In his fightynge were a wood leon
And as a crewel Tygre  was Arcite
As wilde boores  gonnen they to smyte
That frothen  whit as foom  for Ire wood
Vp to the Anclees  foghte they in hir blood
And in this wise  I lete hem fightyng dwelle
And forth I wole  of Theseus yow telle
 The destynee  Ministre general  
That executeth  in the world ouer al
The purueiance  that god hath seyn biforn
So stroong it is  þat thogh the world hadde sworn
The contrarie of a thyng by ye  or nay
Yet som tyme  it shal fallen on a day
That falleth nat eft  with Inne a thousand yeer
ffor certeinly  oure appetites heer
Be it of werre  or pees  or hate  or loue
Al is this ruled  by the sighte aboue
 This mene I now  by myghty Theseus
That for to hunten  is so desirus
And namely  at the grete hert in May
That in his bed  ther daweth hym no day


That he nys clad  and redy for to ryde
With hunte and horn  and houndes hym bisyde
ffor in his huntyng hath he swich delit
That it is  al his ioye and appetit
To been hym self  the grete hertes bane
ffor after Mars  he serueth now Diane
 Cleer was the day  as I haue told er this
And Theseus  with alle ioye and blys
With his ypolita  the faire queene
And Emelie  clothed al in greene
On huntyng be they riden roially
And to the groue  that stood ful faste by
In which ther was an hert as men hym tolde
Duc Theseus  the streighte wey hath holde
And to the launde  he rideth hym ful right
ffor thider was the hert wont haue his flight
And ouer a brook  and so forth on his weye
This duc wol han a cours at hym  or tweye
With houndes swiche  as þat hym list comaunde
And whan this duc was come vn to the launde
Vnder the sonne he looketh  and anon
He was war  of Arcite and Palamon
That foghten breme as it were boles two
The brighte swerdes  wenten to and fro
So hidously  that with the leeste strook
It semed  as it wolde felle an ook
But what they weere  no thyng he ne woot  
This duc his courser  with the spores smoot
And at a stert he was bitwix hem two
And pulled out a swerd  and cryed Hoo
Namoore  vp on peyne  of lesyng of youre heed
By myghty Mars  he shal anon be deed
That smyteth any strook  þat I may seen
But telleth me  what myster men ye been
That been so hardy  for to fighten heer
With outen Iuge  or oother officer


As it weere in a lystes roially
 This Palamon  answerde hastily
And seyde  sire  what nedeth wordes mo
We haue the deeth disserued  bothe two
Two woful wrecches been we  two caytyues
That been encombred  of oure owene lyues
And as thow art a rightful lord and Iuge
Ne yif vs  neither mercy ne refuge
But slee me first for seinte charitee
But slee my felawe eek  as wel as me
Or slee hym first for thogh thow knowe it lite
This is thy mortal foo  this is Arcite
That fro thy lond  is banysshed on his heed
ffor which  he hath deserued to be deed
ffor this is he  þat cam vn to thy yate
And seyde  þat he highte Philostrate
Thus hath he iaped thee  ful many a yeer
And thow  hast maked hym  thy chief Squyer
And this is he  þat loueth Emelye
ffor sith the day is come  þat I shal dye
I make pleynly  my confession
That I am  thilke woful Palamon
That hath thy prison  broken wikkedly
I am thy mortal foo  and it am I
That loueth so hoote  Emelye the brighte
That I wol dyen  present in hir sighte
Wherfore I axe deeth  and my Iuwise
But slee my felawe  in the same wise
ffor bothe haue we  deserued to be slayn
 This worthy duc answerde anoon agayn
And seyde  this is a short conclusion  
Youre owene mouth  by youre confession
Hath dampned yow  and I wol it recorde
It nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde
Ye shul be deed  by myghty Mars the rede
 The queene anoon  for verray wommanhede


Gan for to wepe  and so dide Emelye
And alle the ladies  in the compaignye
Greet pitee was it  as it thoughte hem alle
That euere swich a chaunce  sholde falle
ffor gentil men they weere  of greet estaat
And no thyng but for loue  was this debaat
And sawe  hir blody wowndes  wide and soore
And alle cryden  bothe lasse and moore
Haue mercy lord  vp on vs wommen alle
And on hir bare knees  adown they falle
And wolde haue kist his feet ther as he stood
Til at the laste  aslaked was his mood
ffor pitee  renneth soone in gentil herte
And thogh he first for Ire quook and sterte
He hath considred  shorthly in a clause
The trespas of hem bothe  and eek the cause
And al thogh þat his Ire  hir gilt accused
Yet in his reson  he hem bothe excused
 As thus  he thoghte wel þat euery man
Wol helpe hym self in loue  if þat he kan
And eek  deliuere hym self  out of prison
And eek  his herte hadde compassion
Of wommen  for they wepten euere in oon
And in his gentil herte  he thoghte anoon
And softe vn to hym  self he seyde fy
Vp on a lord  that wol haue no mercy
But be a leon  bothe in word  and dede
To hem  that been in repentaunce and drede
As wel  as to a proud despitous man
That wol mayntene  that he first bigan
That lord  hath litel of discrecion
That in swich caas  kan no dyuysion
But weyeth pryde  and humblesse  after oon
And shortly  whan his Ire is thus agoon
He gan to loken vp  with eyen lighte  
And spak thise same wordes  al on highte


 The god of loue  a benedicitee
How myghty  and how greet a lord is he
Agayns his myght ther gayneth none obstacles
He may be clepid a god  for his miracles
ffor he kan maken  at his owene gyse
Of euerich herte  as þat hym list deuyse
 Lo here  this Arcite  and this Palamon
That quitly were  out of my prison
And myghte haue lyued in Thebes roially
And witen  I am hir mortal enemy
And þat hir deeth  lyth in my myght also
And yet hath loue  maugree hir eyen two
Broght hem hyder  bothe for to dye
Now looketh  is nat that an heigh folye
 Who may been a fool  but if he loue
Bihoold for goddes sake  þat sit aboue
Se how they blede  be they noght wel arrayed
Thus hath hir lord  the god of loue ypayed
Hir wages  and hir fees  for hir seruyse
And yet they wenen to be ful wyse
That seruen loue  for aught þat may bifalle
But this is yet the beste game of alle
That she  for whom  they haue this Iolitee
Kan hem ther fore  as muche thank as me
She woot namoore  of al this hoote fare
By god  than woot a cokkow of an hare
But al moot been assayed  hoot and coold
A man moot been a fool  or yong or oold
I woot it by my self  ful yoore agoon
ffor in my tyme  a seruant was I oon
And ther fore  syn I knowe of loues peyne
And woot how soore  it kan a man distreyne
As he þat hath been caught ofte in his laas
I yow foryeue  al hoolly this trespas
At requeste of the queene  þat kneeleth heere
And eek of Emelye  my suster deere


And ye shal bothe anoon  vn to me swere
That neuere mo  ye shal my contree dere
Ne make werre vp on me  nyght nor day  
But been my freendes  in al that ye may
I yow foryeue  this trespas euerydel
And they hym sworen  his axing faire and wel
And hym of lordshipe  and of mercy preyde
And he hem graunteth grace  and thanne he seyde
 To speke of roial lynage  and richesse
Thogh þat she weere a queene  or a princesse
Ech of yow bothe  is worthy doutelees
To wedden whan tyme is  but nathelees
I speke  as for my suster Emelye
ffor whom  ye haue this stryf and Ialousye
Ye woot your self she may nat wedden two
Atones  thogh ye fighten eueremo
That oon of yow  al be hym looth  or lief
He moot go pipen  in an yuy leef
This is to seyn  she may nat now haue bothe
Al be ye nevere so Ialous  ne so wrothe
And for thy  I yow putte in this degree
That ech of yow  shal haue his destynee
As hym is shape  and herkneth in what wyse
Lo here youre ende  of that I shal deuyse
 My wyl is this  for plat conclusion
With outen any replicacion
If that yow liketh  take it for the beste
That euerich of yow  shal goon where hym leste
ffrely  with outen raunson  or daunger
And this day fifty wykes  fer ne neer
Euerich of yow  shal brynge an hundred knyghtes
Armed for listes  vp at alle rightes
Al redy  to darreyne hire by bataille
And this bihoote I yow  with outen faille
Vp on my trouthe  and as I am a knyght
That wheither of yow bothe  þat hath myght


This is to seyn  þat wheither he or thou
May with his hundred  as I spak of now
Sleen his contrarie  or out of lystes dryue
Thanne shal I yeue  Emelye to wyue
To whom þat ffortune  yeueth so fair a grace
The lystes  shal I maken in this place
And god so wisly  on my soule rewe  
As I shal  euene Iuge been and trewe
Ye shul noon oother ende  with me maken
That oon of yow ne  shall be deed  or taken
And if yow thynketh  this is well ysayd
Sey youre auys  and holdeth yow apayd
This is youre ende  and youre conclusion
 Who looketh lightly now  but Palamon
Who spryngeth vp for ioye  but Arcite
Who koude telle  or who koude it endite
The ioye  that is maked in the place
Whan Theseus  hath doon so fair a grace
But doun on knees  wente euery maner wight
And thonken hym  with al hir herte and myght
And namely the Thebans ofte sythe
And thus with good hope  and herte blythe
They take hir leeue  and homward gonne they ryde
To Thebes  with olde walles wyde
I trowe  men wolde deme it necligence
If I foryete  to tellen the despence
Of Theseus  that gooth so bisily
To maken vp the lystes  roially
That swich a noble Theatre  as it was
I dar wel seyn  in this world ther nas
The circuit a myle was aboute
Walled of stoon  and dyched al with oute
Round was the shape  in manere of compas


fful of degrees  the heighte of sixty paas
That whan a man  was set on o degree
He letted noght his felawe for to see
 Estward ther stood a gate  of Marbul whit
Westward  right swich another  in the oposit
And shortly to concluden  swich a place
Was noon in erthe  as in so lite a space
ffor in the lond  ther was no crafty man  
That Geometrye  or Ars metrik kan
Ne purtreyour  ne keruere of ymages
That Theseus  ne yaf mete and wages
The Theatre  for to maken and deuyse
And for to doon  his ryte and sacrifise
He Estward hath  vp on the gate aboue
In worship of venus  goddesse of loue
Doon maad an Auter  and an oratorie
And on the westward  in memorie
Of Mars  he maked hath right swich another
That coste largely  of gold a fother
And Northward  in a touret on the wal
Of Alabastre whit and reed Coral
An oratorie  riche for to see
In worshipe  of Diane of chastitee
Hath Theseus  doon wroght in noble Wise
 But yet hadde I forgeten  to deuyse
The noble keruyng  and the purtreitures
The shape  the contenance  and the figures
That weren  in thise oratories thre
 ffirst  in the temple of Venus  maystow se
Wroght on the wal  ful pitous to biholde
The broken slepes  and the sykes colde
The sacred teerys  and the waymentynge
The firy strokes  of the desirynge
That loues seruantz  in this lyf enduren
The othes  that hir couenantz assuren
Plesance  and hope  desir  foolhardynesse


Beautee and youthe  baudrye  richesse
Charmes and force  lesynges  flaterye
Despense  bisynesse  and Ialousye
That wered  of yelowe gooldes a gerland
And a Cokkow  sittyng on hir hand
ffestes  Instrumentz  caroles  daunces
Lust and array  and alle the circumstaunces
Of loue  whiche þat I rekned  and rekne shal
By ordre  weren peynted on the wal
And mo than  I kan make of mencion
ffor soothly  al the Mount of Citheron
Ther Venus  hath hir principal dwellynge  
Was shewed on the wal  in purtreyynge
With al the gardyn  and the lustynesse
Nat was foryeten  the porter ydelnesse
Ne Narcisus the faire  of yoore agon
Ne yet  the folie  of kyng Salomon
Ne yet the grete strengthe of Ercules
Thenchantementz  of Medea and Circes
Ne of Turnus  with the hardy fiers corage
The ryche Cresus  caytif in seruage
 Thus may ye seen  þat wisdom ne richesse
Beautee  ne sleighte  strengthe hardynesse
Ne may with Venus  maken champartie
ffor as hir lust the world than may she gye
Lo all this folk  so caught were in hir laas
Til they for wo  ful ofte seyde allas
Suffiseth heere ensamples  oon or two
And though  I koude rekne a thousand mo
 The statue of Venus  glorious for to see
Was naked  fletyng in the large See
And fro the nauele doun  al couered was
With wawes grene  and brighte as any glas
A Citole in hir right hand  hadde she
And on hir heed  ful semely for to se
A rose gerland  fressh  and wel smellynge


Aboue hir heed  hir dowues flikerynge
Biforn hire stood  hir sone Cupido
Vp on his shuldres  wynges hadde he two
And blynd he was  as it is ofte seene
A bowe he bar  and Arwes brighte and keene
 Why sholde I nat as wel  eek telle yow al
The purtreyture  þat was vp on the wal
With Inne the temple  of myghty Mars the rede
Al peynted was the wal  in lengthe and brede
Lyk to the eestres  of the grisly place
That highte the grete temple  of Mars in Trace
In thilke colde  frosty Region
Ther as Mars  hath his souereyn mansion
 ffirst on the wal  was peynted a fforest
In which ther dwelleth  neither man ne best
With knotty  knarry  bareyne trees olde  
Of stubbes sharpe  and hidouse to biholde
In which  ther ran a rombul  in a swough
As thogh a storm  sholde bresten euery bough
And downward on an hil  vnder a bente
Ther stood the temple  of Mars armypotente
Wroght al of burned steel  of which the entree
Was long and streyt and gastly for to see
And ther out cam a rage  and swich a veze
That it made  al the gate for to rese
The Northren light in at the dores shoon
ffor wyndow on the wal  ne was ther noon
Thurgh which men myghten  any light discerne
The dore was al  of Athamant eterne
Yclenched  ouerthwart and endelong
With Iren togh  and for to make it strong
Euery piler  the temple to sustene
Was tonne greet of Iren bright and shene
 Ther say I first the dirke ymagynynge
Of felonye  and al the compassynge
The cruel Ire  reed as any gleede


The pike purs  and eek the pale drede
The smylere  with the knyf vnder the cloke
The shipne brennyng  with the blake smoke
The treson  of the mordryng in the bed
The open werre  with woundes al bibled
Contek  with blody knyf and sharpe manace
Al ful of chirkyng was that sory place
 The sleere of hym self  yet saugh I ther
His herte blood  hath bathed al his heer
The nayl ydryuen  in the shode a nyght
The colde deeth  with mouth gapyng vp right
Amyddes of the temple  sat meschaunce
With disconfort and sory contenaunce
 Yet saugh I woodnesse  laughyng in his rage
Armed compleynt out hees  and fiers outrage
The caroyne in the bussh  with throte ycorue
A thousand slayn  and noght of qualm ystorue
The tiraunt with the praye  by force yraft
The town destroyed  ther was no thyng laft
 Yet saugh I brent the shippes hoppesteres  
The hunte strangled  with the wilde beres
The sowe freten the child  right in the Cradel
The Cook yscalded  for al his longe ladel
 Naught was forgeten  by the Infortune of Marte
The Cartere  ouer ryden  with his Carte
Vnder the wheel  ful lowe he lay adown
Ther were also  of Martes deuysioun
The Barbour  and the Bochier and the Smyth
That forgeth sharpe swerdes  on his styth
 And al aboue  depeynted in a tour
Saugh I Conquest sittyng in greet honour
With the sharpe swerd  ouer his heed
Hangynge  by a subtil twynes threed
 Depeynted was  the slaghtre of Iulius
Of grete Nero  and of Anthonius
Al be  þat thilke tyme  they were vnborn


Yet was hir deeth  depeynted ther biforn
By manacynge of Mars  right by figure
So was it shewed  in that purtreyture
As is depeynted  in the Sertres aboue
Who shal be slayn  or ellis deed for loue
Suffiseth oon ensample  in stories olde
I may nat rekne hem alle  thogh I wolde
 The Statue of Mars  vp on a Carte stood
Armed  and loked grym  as he were wood
And ouer his heed  ther shynen two figures
Of sterres  þat been clepyd in Scriptures
That oon Puella  that oother Rubeus
This god of armes  was arrayed thus
A wolf ther stood  bifore hym at his feet
With eyen rede  and of a man he eet
With subtil pencel  was depeynted this storie
In redoutynge of Mars  and of his glorie
 Now to the temple  of Diane the chaste
As shortly as I kan  I wol me haste
To telle yow  al the discripsioun
Depeynted been the walles  vp and doun
Of huntyng and of shamefast chastitee
Ther saw I  how woful Calistopee
Whan þat Diane  agreued was with here  
Was turned  fro a womman  til a Bere
And after was she maad  the lode sterre
Thus was it peynted  I kan seye yow no ferre
Hir sone is eek a sterre  as men may see
Ther saw I Dane  yturned to a tree
I mene nat  the goddesse diane
But Penneus doghter  which þat highte Dane
 Ther saw I Attheon  an hert ymaked
ffor vengeaunce  þat he saw Diane al naked
I seigh  how þat hise houndes haue hym caught
And freten hym  for þat they knewe hym naught
 Yet peynted was  a litel ferther moor


How Atthalante  hunted the wilde boor
And Meleagree  and many another mo
ffor which Diane  wroghte hym care and wo
Ther saw I many another wonder storie
The whiche  me list nat drawen to memorie
 This goddesse on hert ful hye seet
With smale houndes  al aboute hir feet
And vnder nethe hir feet she hadde a moone
Wexinge it was  and sholde wanye soone
In gaude grene  hir statue yclothed was
With bowe in honde  and arwes in a cas
Hir eyen caste she  ful lowe adown
Ther Pluto  hath his dirke Regioun
A womman trauailyng was hir biforn
But for hir child  so longe was unborn
fful pitously  lucina gan she calle
And seyde help  for thow mayst best of alle
Wel koude he peynte lyfly  that it wroghte
With many a floryn  he the hewes boghte
 Now been thise listes maad  and Theseus
That at his grete cost arrayed thus
The temples  and the Theatre euery del
Whan it was doon  hym liked wonder wel
But stynte I wole  of Theseus alite
And speke of Palamon  and of Arcite
 The day approcheth  of hir retournynge
That euerich  sholde an hundred knyghtes brynge
The bataille to darreyne  as I yow tolde  
And til Atthenes  hir couenant for to holde
Hath euerich of hem  broght a hundred knyghtes
Wel armed for the werre  at alle rightes
And sikerly  ther trowed many a man
That neuere sithen  þat the world bigan
As for to speke  of knyghthod of hir hond
As fer  as god hath maked see and lond
Nas of so fewe  so noble a compaignye


ffor euery wight þat loued chiualrye
And wolde his thankes  han a passant name
Hath prayd  that he myghte been of that game
And wel was hym  þat ther to chosen was
ffor if ther fille  tomorwe swich a cas
Ye knowen wel  þat euery lusty knyght
That loueth paramours  and hath his myght
Were it in Engelond  or ellis where
They wolde hir thankes  wilnen to be there
To fighten for a lady  benedicitee
It were a lusty sighte  for to see
 And right so  ferden they with Palamon
With hym ther wenten  knyghtes many oon
Som wol ben armed  in an haubergeon
And in a Brestplate  and in a light gypon
And som wol haue  a piere plates large
And som wol haue  a Pruce sheeld  or a targe
Som wol been armed  on his legges weel
And haue an Ax  and som a Maas of steel
Ther nys no newe gyse  þat it nas oold
Armed were they  as I haue yow toold
Euerich  after his opinyon
 Ther maystow seen  comynge with Palamon
Lygurge hym self the grete kyng of Trace
Blak was his beerd  and manly was his face
The cercles of his eyen  in his heed
They gloweden  bitwixen yelow and reed
And lyk a griffon  loked he aboute
With keempe herys  on his browes stoute
His lymes grete  his brawnes  harde and stronge
Hys shuldres brode  hise armes rounde and longe
And as the gyse was  in his contree  
fful hye  vp on a Chaar of gold stood he
With foure white Boles  in the trays
In stide of Cotearmure  ouer his harnays
With nayles yelwe  and brighte as any gold


He hadde a Berys Skyn  colblak  for old
His longe heer  was kembed bihynde his bak
As any Rauenes fetthere  it shoon for blak
A wrethe of gold  greet of huge wighte
Vp on his heed  and ful of stones brighte
Of fyne Rubyes  and of dyamauntz
Aboute his Chaar  they wente white Alauntz
Twenty and mo  as grete as any Steer
To hunten at the leon  and the deer
And folwed hym  with mosel faste ybounde
Colered of gold  and turrettes filed rounde
An hundred lordes  hadde he in his route
Armed ful wel  with hertes stierne and stoute
 With Arcita  in stories as men fynde
The grete Emetrius  the kyng of Inde
Vp on a Steede bay  trapped in steel
Couered in a clooth of gold  dyapred weel
Cam ridynge  lyk the god of Armes Mars
His cote armure  was of clooth of Tars
Couched with perlys white  and rounde and grete
His sadel was  of brend gold newe ybete
A Mantelet vp on his shulder hangynge
Bretful of Rubies reede  as fyr sparklynge
His crispe heer  lyk rynges was yronne
And that was yelow  and glitred as the sonne
His nose was heigh  hise eyen bright Citryn
His lyppes rounde  his colour was sangwyn
A fewe fraknes  in his face yspreynd
Bitwixen yelow  and som del blak ymeynd
And as a leon  he his lookyng caste
Of xxv yeer  his age I caste
His beerd  was wel bigonne for to sprynge
His voys  was as a trompe thonderynge
Vp on his heed  he wered of laurer grene
A gerland fressh  and lusty for to seene
Vp on his hand  he bar for his deduyt  

An Egle tame  as any lilie whyt
An hundred lordes  hadde he with hym there
Al armed saue hir heddes  in al hir gere
fful richely  in alle manere thynges
ffor trusteth wel  þat dukes  Erles  kynges
Were gadred  in this noble compaignye
ffor loue  and for encrees of chiualrye
Aboute this kyng ther ran on euery part
fful many a tame leon and leopart
 And in this wise  thise lordes alle and some
Been on the Sonday  to the Citee come
Aboute pryme  and in the town alight
 This Theseus  this duc this worthy knyght
Whan he hadde broght hem  in to his Citee
And Inned hem  euerich at his degree
He festeth hem  and dooth so gret labour
To esen hem  and doon hem al honour
That yet men wenen  þat no mannes wit
Of noon estaat ne koude amenden it
 The Mynstralcye  the seruyce  at the feeste
The grete yiftes  to the meeste and leeste
The ryche array  of Theseus Paleys
Ne who sat first or last vp on the deys
What ladyes fairest been  and best daunsynge
Or which of hem  kan daunse best and synge
Ne who moost feelyngly  speketh of loue
What haukes sitten  on the perche aboue
What houndes lyggen  on the floor adown
Of al this  make I now no mencioun
But al theffect that thynketh me the beste
Now comth the point and herkneth if yow leste
 The Sonday nyght er day bigan to sprynge
Whan Palamon  the larke herde synge
Al thogh it nere nat day  by houres two
Yet soong the larke  and Palamon right tho
With holy herte  and with an heigh corage


He roos  to wenden on his pilgrymage
Vn to the blisful  Scitherea benygne
I mene Venus  honurable and digne
And in hir hour  he walketh forth a paas  
Vn to the lystes  ther hir temple was
And down he kneleth  and with humble cheere
And herte soor  he seyde as ye shal heere
 ffaireste of faire  o lady myn Venus
Doghter of Ioue  and spouse to Vulcanus
Thow gladere  of the mount of Cytheron
ffor thilke loue  thow haddest to Adoon
Haue pitee  of my bittre teerys smerte
And taak myn humble prayere at thyn herte
 Allas I ne haue no langage to telle
Theffecte ne the tormentz of myn helle
Myn herte  may myne harmes nat biwreye
I am so confus  þat I kan noght seye
But mercy lady bright þat knowest wele
My thoght and seest what harmes þat I feele
Considre al this  and rewe vp on my soore
As wisly  as I shal for euere moore
Emforth my myght thy trewe seruant be
And holden werre  alwey with chastitee
That make I myn avow  so ye me helpe
I kepe noght of armes for to yelpe
Ne I ne axe noght  tomorwe  to haue victorie
Ne renoun in this cas  ne veyne glorie
Of prys of armes  blowen vp and down
But I wolde haue  fully possessioun
Of Emelye  and dye in thy seruyse
ffynd thow the manere  how  and in what wyse
I recche nat but it may bettre be
To haue victorie of hem  or they of me
So þat I haue  my lady in myn armes
ffor thogh so be  þat Mars is god of armes
Youre vertu is so greet in heuene aboue


That if yow list I shal wel haue my loue
 Thy temple  wol I worshipe euere mo
And on thyn Auter  wher I ryde or go
I wol doon sacrifice  and fyres beete
And if ye wol noght so  my lady sweete
Thanne praye I thee  to morwe with a spere
That Arcita  me thurgh the herte bere
Thanne rekke I noght whan I haue lost my lyf  
Thogh þat Arcita  wynne hire to his wyf
This is theffect and ende of my prayere
Yif me my loue  thow blisful lady deere
 Whan the orison was doon  of Palamon
His sacrifice he dide  and that anon
fful pitously  with alle circumstances
Al telle I nat as now  his obseruances
But at the laste  the Statue of Venus shook
And made a signe  wher by þat he took
That his prayere  accepted was that day
ffor thogh the signe  shewed a delay
Yet wiste he wel  þat graunted was his boone
And with glad herte  he wente hym hoom ful soone
 The thridde hour in equal  þat Palamon
Bigan  to Venus temple  for to gon
Vp roos the soone  and vp roos Emelye
And to the temple of Diane  gan hye
Hir maydens  þat she thider with hire ladde
fful redily with hem  the fyr they hadde
Thencens  the clothes  and the remenant al
That to the sacrifice  longen shal
The hornes ful of Mede  as was the gyse
Ther lakked noght to doon hir sacrifise
 Smokynge the temple  ful of clothes faire
This Emelye  with herte debonaire
Hir body wessh  with water of a welle
But hou she dide hir ryte  I dar nat telle
But it be  any thyng in general


And yet it were a game  to heren al
To hym þat meneth wel  it nere no charge
But it is good  a man be at his large
 Hir brighte heer was kembed  vntressed al
A corone  of a grene ook cerial
Vp on hir heed was set ful fair and meete
Two fyres  on the Auter gan she beete
And dide hir thynges  as men may biholde
In Stace of Thebes  and othere bokes olde
Whan kyndled was the fyr  with pitous cheere
Vn to Diane  she spak  as ye may heere
 O chaste goddesse  of the wodes grene  
To whom  bothe heuene  and erthe  and See is seene
Queene of the regne of Pluto  derk and lowe
Goddesse of maydenes  þat myn herte hast knowe
fful many a yeer  and woost what I desire
As keepe me  fro thy vengeance and thyn Ire
That Attheon  aboghte crewelly
Chaste goddesse  wel wostow þat I
Desire  to been a mayden  al my lyf
Ne neuere wol I be  no loue  ne wyf
I am thow woost yet of thy compaignye
A mayde  and loue huntyng and venerye
And for to walken  in the wodes wilde
And noght to been a wyf  and be with childe
Noght wol I knowe  compaignye of man
Now help me lady  sith ye may and kan
ffor tho thre formes  þat thow hast in thee
And Palamon  þat hath swich loue to me
And eek Arcite  þat loueth me so soore
This grace I praye thee  with oute moore
As seend loue and pees  bitwix hem two
And fro me  turn awey  hir hertes so
That al hir hote loue  and hir desir
And al hir bisy torment and hir fyr
Be queynt and turned in another place


And if so be  thow wolt noght do me grace
Or if my destynee  be shape so
That I shal nedes  haue oon of hem two
As seend me hym  þat moost desireth me
Bihoold goddesse  of clene chastitee
The bittre teerys  þat on my chekes falle
Syn thow art mayde  and kepere of vs alle
My maydenhode thow kepe  and wel conserue
And whil I lyue  a mayde I wol thee serue
 The fyres brenne  vp on the Auter cleere
Whil Emelie  is thus in hir prayere
But sodeynly  she seigh a sighte queynte
ffor right anon  oon of the fyres queynte
And quyked agayn  and after that anon
That oother fyr was queynt and al agon
And as it queynte  it made a whistlynge  
As doon thise weete brondes  in hir brennynge
And at the brondes ende  out ran anoon
As it were  blody dropes many oon
ffor which  so soore agast was Emelye
That she was wel neigh mad  and gan to crye
ffor she ne wiste  what it signyfied
But oonly for the feere  thus hath she cryed
And weepe  þat it was pitee for to heere
 And ther with al  Diane gan appeere
With bowe in honde  right as an hunteresse
And seyde doghter  stynt thyn heuynesse
Among the goddes hye  it is affermed
And by eterne word  writen and confermed
Thou shalt be wedded  vn to oon of tho
That han for thee  so muche care and wo
But vn to which of hem  I may noght telle
ffare wel  for I ne may no lenger dwelle
The fires  which þat on myn Auter brenne
Shul thee declaren  er þat thow go henne
Thyn auenture of loue  as in this cas


And with that word  the Arwes in the Caas
Of the goddesse  clateren faste and rynge
And forth she wente  and made a vanysshynge
ffor which  this Emelye astoned was
And seyde  what amounteth this allas
I putte me  in thy proteccion
Diane  and in thy disposicion
And hoom she gooth anoon  the nexte weye
This is theffect ther nys namoore to seye
 The nexte houre of Mars  folwynge this
Arcite  vn to the temple walked is
Of fierse Mars  to doon his sacrifise
With alle the rytes  of his payen wise
With pitous herte  and heigh deuocion
Right thus to Mars  he seyde his orison
 O stronge god  þat in the regnes colde
Of Trace  honoured art and lord yholde
And hast in euery regne  and euery lond
Of armes  al the brydel in thyn hond
And hem fortunest as thee list deuyse  
Accepte of me  my pitous sacrifise
If so be  þat my youthe may disserue
And þat my myght be worthy for to serue
Thy godhede  þat I may be oon of thyne
Thanne praye I thee  to rewe vp on my pyne
ffor thilke peyne  and thilke hote fyr
In which  thow whilom brendest for desir
Whan þat thow vsedest the beautee
Of faire yonge  fresshe Venus free
And haddest hire in armes at thy wille
Al though thee ones  on a tyme mysfille
Whan Vulcanus  hadde caught thee in his laas
And foond thee lyggyng by his wyf allas
ffor thilke sorwe  þat was in thyn herte
Haue routhe as wel  vp on my peynes smerte
I am yong  and vnkonnyng as thow woost


And as I trowe  with loue offended moost
That euere was  any lyues creature
ffor she þat dooth me  al this wo endure
Ne reccheth neuere  wher I synke or fleete
And wel I woot er she me mercy heete
I moot with strengthe  wynne hire in the place
And wel I woot with outen help and grace
Of thee  ne may my strengthe noght auaille
Thanne help me lord  tomorwe in my bataille
ffor thilke fyr  þat whilom brende thee
As wel as thilke fyr  now brenneth me
And do þat I tomorwe  may haue victorie
Myn be the trauaille  and thyn be the glorie
Thy souereyn temple  wol I moost honouren
Of any place  and alwey moost labouren
In thy plesaunce  and in thy craftes stronge
And in thy temple  I wol my baner honge
And alle the armes  of my compaignye
And euere mo  vn til þat day I dye
Eterne fyr  I wol bifore thee fynde
And eek to this auow  I wol me bynde
My berd  myn heer  þat hangeth long adown
That neuere yet ne felte offensioun
Of Rasour  nor of Shere  I wol thee yiue  
And been thy trewe seruant whil I lyue
Now lord haue routhe  vp on my sorwes soore
Yif me the victorie  I axe thee namoore
 The prayere stynt of Arcita the stronge
The rynges  on the temple dore þat honge
And eek the dores  clatereden ful faste
Of which Arcita  som what hym agaste
The fires brende  vp on the Auter brighte
That it gan al the temple for to lighte
A swete smel  anoon the ground vp yaf
And Arcita  anoon his hand vp haf
And moore encens  in to the fyr he caste


With othere rytes mo  and at the laste
 The statue of Mars  bigan his hauberk rynge
And with that sown  he herde a murmurynge
fful lowe and dym  and seyde thus  Victorie
ffor which  he yaf to Mars  honour and glorie
 And thus with ioye  and hope  wel to fare
Arcite anoon  vn to his In is fare
As fayn as fowel  is of the brighte sonne
 And right anoon  swich stryf ther is bigonne
ffor thilke grauntyng in the heuene aboue
Bitwixe Venus  the goddesse of loue
And Mars  the sterne god armipotente
That Iuppiter  was bisy it to stente
Til þat the pale  Saturnus the colde
That knew so manye  of auentures olde
ffoond in his olde experience  an art
That he ful soone  hath plesed euery part
As sooth is seyd  elde hath greet auantage
In elde  is bothe wisdom and vsage
Men may the olde atrenne and nat atrede
Saturne anoon  to stynten stryf and drede
Al be it  þat it is agayn his kynde
Of al this stryf he kan remedie fynde
 My deere doghter Venus  quod Saturne
My cours  that hath so wyde for to turne
Hath moore power  than woot any man
Myn is the drenchyng in the See so wan
Myn is the prison  in the derke cote  
Myn is the stranglyng and hangyng by the throte
The murmur  and the cherles rebellynge
The groynyng and the pryuee empoysonynge
I do vengeance  and pleyn correccion
Whil I dwelle  in the signe of the leon
Myn is the ruyne  of the heighe halles
The fallyng of the toures  and of the walles
Vp on the Mynour  or the Carpenter


I slow Sampson  shakyng the piler
And myne be  the maladies colde
The derke tresons  and the castes olde
My lookyng is the fader of pestilence
Now weep namoore  I shal doon diligence
That Palamon  that is thyn owene knyght
Shal haue his lady  as thow hast hym hight
Thogh Mars shal helpe his knyght yet nathelees
Bitwixe yow  ther moot be som tyme pees
Al be ye noght of o complexion
That causeth al day  swich diuision
I am thyn Aiel  redy at thy wille
Weepe now namoore  I wol thy lust fulfille
 Now wol I stynten  of the goddes aboue
Of Mars  and of Venus  goddesse of loue
And telle yow  as pleynly as I kan
The grete effect  for which þat I bigan
 Greet was the feeste  in Atthenes that day
And eek the lusty seson  of that May
Made euery wight to been in swich plesaunce
That al that monday  Iusten they and daunce
And spenden it in Venus heigh seruyse
And by the cause  þat they sholde ryse
Erly  for to seen the grete sight
Vn to hir reste  wente they at nyght
And on the morwe  whan the day gan sprynge
Of hors and harneys  noyse and claterynge
Ther was in hostelryes  al aboute
And to the paleys  rood ther many a route
Of lordes  vp on steedes and palfreys
Ther maistow seen  deuysynge of harneys
So vnkouth  and so ryche  and wroght so weel  
Of Goldsmythrye  of Broudyng and of steel


The sheldes brighte  testers  and trappures
Goldhewen helmes  hauberkes  cote armures
Lordes in parementz  on hir coursers
Knyghtes of retenue  and eek Squyers
Nailynge the speres  and the helmes bokelynge
Gyggynge of sheeldes  with layners lasynge
Ther as nede is  they were no thyng ydel
The fomy steedes  on the golden brydel
Gnawynge  and faste the Armurers also
With fyle and hamer  prykyng to and fro
Yemen on foote  and communes many oon
With shorte staues  thikke as they may goon
Pipes  trompes  Nakers  Claryounes
That in the bataille  blowen blody sownes
The paleys ful of peples  vp and down
Heer thre  ther ten  holdynge hir questioun
Deuynynge  of thise Thebans knyghtes two
Somme seyde thus  somme seyden it shal be so
Somme helden with hym  with the blake berd
Somme with the balled  somme with the thikke herd
Somme seyde  he looked grym  and he wolde fighte
He hath a Sparth  of xx pound of wighte
Thus was the halle  ful of deuynynge
Longe after  þat the sonne gan to sprynge
 The grete Theseus  þat of his sleepe awaked
With mynstralcye  and noyse þat was maked
Held yet the chambres  of his paleys ryche
Til þat the Theban knyghtes  bothe yliche
Honoured  weren in to the paleys fet
 Duc Theseus  is at a wyndow set
Arrayed  right as he weere a god in Trone
The peple preeseth  thiderward ful soone
Hym for to seen  and doon heigh reuerence
And eek  to herkne his heste  and his sentence
 An heraud on a Scaffold  made an oo
Til al the noyse  of the peple was ydo


And whan he say the peple  of noyse al stille
Thus shewed he  the myghty dukes wille
 The lord hath  of his heighe discrecion  
Considred  þat it were destruccion
To gentil blood  to fighten in the gyse
Of mortal bataille  now in this emprise
Wher fore  to shapen  þat they shal noght dye
He wole  his firste purpos modifie
 No man ther fore  vp on peyne  of los of lyf
No manere shot ne polax  ne short knyf
In to the lystes sende  or thider brynge
Ne short swerd for to stoke  with point bitynge
No man ne drawe  ne bere it by his syde
Ne no man  shal vn to his felawe ryde
But o cours  with a sharp ygrounde spere
ffoyne if hym list on foote  hym self to were
And he þat is at meschief  shal be take
And noght slayn  but be broght vn to the stake
That shal been ordeyned  on eyther syde
But thider he shal bi force  and ther abyde
And if so falle  the Chiefteyn be take
On outher syde  or ellis sleen his make
No lenger  shal the tourneying laste
God spede yow  go forth and ley on faste
With long swerd  and with mace  fighteth your fille
Go now youre wey  this is the lordes wille
 The voys of peple  touched the heuene
So loude cryde they  with loude steuene
God saue swich a lord  that is so good
He wilneth  no destruccion of blood
 Vp goon the trompes  and the melodye
And to the lystes  ryt the compaignye
By ordinance  thurgh out the Citee large
Hanged with clooth of gold  and noght with sarge
 fful lyk a lord  this noble duc gan ryde
Thise two Thebans  vp on eyther syde


And after rood the queene  and Emelye
And after that another compaignye
Of oon and oother  after hire degree
And thus they passen  thurgh out the Citee
And to the lystes  coome they bityme
It nas nat of the day  yet fully pryme
 Whan set was Theseus  ful ryche and hye  
Ypolita the queene  and Emelye
And othere ladyes  in degrees aboute
Vn to the setes  preeseth al the route
And westward  thrugh the gates vnder Marte
Arcite  and eek the hundred of his parte
With baner reed  is entred right anon
 And in that selus moment Palamon
Is vnder Venus  Estward in the place
With baner whit  and hardy cheere and face
In al the world  to seken vp and down
So euene  with outen variacioun
Ther nere  swiche compaignyes tweye
ffor ther was noon so wys  þat koude seye
That any hadde  of oother auantage
Of worthynesse  ne of estaat ne age
So euene  were they chosen for to gesse
And in two renges  faire they hem dresse
 Whan þat hir names  rad were euerichon
That in hir nombre  gyle were ther noon
Tho were the gates shet and cryd was loude
Do now youre deuoir  yonge knyghtes proude
 The heraudes  lefte hir prikyng vp and down
Now ryngen trompes loude  and Clarioun
Ther is namoore to seyn  but west and Est
In goon the speres  ful sadly in the arest
In gooth the sharpe spore  in to the syde
Ther seen men  who kan Iuste  and who kan ryde
Ther shyueren shaftes  vp on sheeldes thikke
He feeleth  thurgh the herte spoon the prykke


Vp spryngeth speres  twenty foot on highte
Out goon the swerdes  as the siluer brighte
The helmes they tohewen  and toshrede
Out brest the blood  with sterne stremys rede
With myghty maces  the bones they tobreste
He thurgh the thikkest of the throng gan threste
Ther stomblen steedes stronge  and doun gooth al
He rolleth vnder foot as dooth a bal
He foyneth on his feet with his tronchoun
And he hym hurteth  with his hors adoun
He thurgh the body is hurt and sithen ytake  
Maugree his heed  and broght vn to the Stake
As forward was  right there he moste abyde
Another  lad is on that oother syde
 And som tyme  dooth hem Theseus to reste
Hem to refresshe  and drynken if hem leste
fful ofte aday  haue thise Thebans two
Togydre ymet and wroght his felawe wo
Vnhorsed hath ech oother  of hem tweye
Ther nas no tygre  in the vale of Galgopheye
Whan þat hir whelp is stole  whan it is lyte
So cruel on the hunte  as is Arcite
ffor Ialous herte  vp on this Palamon
Ne in Belmarye  ther nys so fel leon
That hunted is  or for his hunger wood
Ne of his praye  desireth so the blood
As Palamon  to sleen his foo Arcite
The Ialous strokes  on hir helmes byte
Out renneth blood  on bothe hir sydes rede
 Som tyme an ende ther is  of euery dede
ffor er the sonne  vn to the reste wente
The stronge kyng Emetrius  gan hente
This Palamon  as he faught with Arcite
And made his swerd  depe in his flessh to byte
And by the force of twenty  is he take
Vnyolden  and ydrawen to the stake


And in the rescous  of this Palamon
The stronge kyng lygurge  is born adoun
And kyng Emetrius  for al his strengthe
Is born out of his sadel  a swerdes lengthe
So hitte hym Palamon  er he were take
But al for noght he was broght to the stake
His hardy herte  myghte hym helpe naught
He moste abyde  whan þat he was caught
By force  and eek by composicion
 Who sorweth now  but woful Palamon
That moot namoore  goon agayn to fighte
And whan þat Theseus  hadde seen this sighte
Vn to the folk  that foghten thus echon
He cryde  hoo namoore  for it is doon
I wol be trewe Iuge  and nat partye  
Arcite of Thebes  shal haue Emelye
That by his fortune  hath hire faire ywonne
Anon ther is a noyse of peple bigonne
ffor ioye of this  so loude and heigh with alle
It semed  þat the lystes sholde falle
 What kan now faire Venus  doon aboue
What seith she now  what dooth this queene of loue
But wepeth so  for wantyng of hir wille
Til þat hir teerys  in the lystes fille
She seyde  I am ashamed doutelees
 Saturnus seyde  doghter hoold thy pees
Mars hath his wyl  his knyght hath al his boone
And by myn heed  thow shalt been esed soone
 The trompours  with the loude Mynstralcye
The heraudes  þat ful loude yelle and crye
Been in hir wele  for ioye of daun Arcite
But herkneth me  and stynteth noyse a lite
Which a myracle  ther bifel anon
 This fierse Arcite  hath of his helm ydon
And on a Courser  for to shewe his face
He priketh  endelong the large place


Lookyng vpward  vp on this Emelye
And she agayn  hym caste a freendly eye
    
    
And she was al his cheere  as in his herte
Out of the ground  a furye Infernal sterte
ffrom Pluto sent at requeste of Saturne
ffor which his hors  for feere gan to turne
And leep asyde  and foundred as he leepe
And er þat Arcite  may taken keepe
He pighte hym  on the pomel of his heed
That in the place  he lay as he were deed
His brest to brosten  with his Sadel bowe
As blak he lay  as any col  or crowe
So was the blood  yronnen in his face
Anon he was yborn out of the place
With herte soor  to Theseus Paleys
Tho was he coruen  out of his harneys
And in a bed ybroght ful faire and blyue
ffor he was yet in memorie and alyue
And alwey cryinge  after Emelye  
 Duc Theseus  with al his compaignye
Is comen hoom  to Atthenes his Citee
With alle blisse  and greet solempnytee
Al be it þat this auenture was falle
He nolde noght disconforten hem alle
 Men seyde eek Arcite  shal nat dye
He shal been heelyd  of his maladye
And of another thyng  they were as fayn
That of hem alle  was ther noon yslayn
Al were they soore yhurt and namely oon
That with a Spere  was thirled the brest boon
 To oothere woundes  and to broken armes
Somme hadden salues  and somme hadden charmes
ffermacyes of herbes and eek saue
They dronken  for they wolde hir lymes haue


ffor which this noble duc  as he wel kan
Conforteth  and honoureth euery man
And made reuel  al the longe nyght
Vn to the straunge lordes  as was right
 Ne ther was holden to disconfitynge
But as a Iustes  or a tourneyinge
ffor soothly  there was no disconfiture
ffor fallyng  nys nat but an auenture
Ne to been had by force vn to the stake
Vnyolden  and with twenty knyghtes take
A persone allone  with outen mo
And haryed forth  by arm  foot  and to
And eek his steede  dryuen forth with staues
With footmen  bothe yemen and eek knaues
It nas arretted hym  no vileynye
Ther may no man  clepe it cowardye
 ffor which anoon  Duc Theseus leet crye
To stynten  al rancour and enuye
The gre  as wel of oo syde as of oother
And eyther syde ylyk as otheres brother
And yaf hem yiftes  after hir degree
And fully heeld a feeste  dayes three
And conueyed  the kynges worthily
Out of his toun  a iournee largely
And hoom wente euery man  the righte way  
Ther was namoore  but fare wel haue good day
Of this bataille  I wol namoore endite
But speke of Palamon  and of Arcite
Swelleth the brest of Arcite  and the soore
Encreese that his herte  moore and moore
The clothered blood  for any lechecraft
Corrupteth  and is in his bouk  ylaft
That neyther veyne blood  ne ventusynge
Ne drynke of herbes  may been his helpynge
The vertu expulsyf  or animal
ffro thilke vertu  clepyd natural


Ne may the venym  voyden ne expelle
The pipes of his longes  gan to swelle
And euery lacerte  in his brest adown
Is shent with venym and corrupcioun
Hym gayneth neither  for to gete his lyf
Vomyt vpward  ne downward laxatyf
Al is to brosten  thilke regioun
Nature  hath no dominacioun
And certeinly  ther nature wol nat werche
ffare wel Phisyk  go ber the man to cherche
This al and som  þat Arcita moot dye
ffor which  he sendeth after Emelye
And Palamon  þat was his cosyn deere
Thanne seyde he thus  as ye shal after heere
 Nat may the woful spirit in myn herte
Declare a point of alle my sorwes smerte
To yow my lady  þat I loue moost
But I byquethe  the seruice of my goost
To yow  abouen euery creature
Syn þat my lyf  may no lenger dure
Allas the wo  allas the peynes stronge
That I for yow haue suffred  and so longe
Allas the deeth  allas myn Emelye  
Allas  departyng of oure compaignye
Allas myn hertes queene  allas my wif
Myn hertes lady  endere of my lyf
What is this world  what axeth men to haue
Now with his loue  now in his colde graue
    
    
    
    
 I haue heer  with my cosyn Palamon
Had stryf and rancour  many a day gon
ffor loue of yow  and for my Ialousye
And Iuppiter  so wys my soule gye


To speken  of a seruaunt proprely
With circumstaunces alle  trewely
That is to seyn  trouthe  honour  knyghthede
Wisdom  humblesse  estaat  and heigh kynrede
ffredom  and al  that longeth to that art
So Iuppiter  haue of my soule part
As in this world  right now ne knowe I non
So worthy to been loued  as Palamon
That serueth yow  and wol doon al his lyf
And if þat euere  ye shal been a wyf
fforyet nat Palamon  the gentil man
And with that word  his speche faille gan
ffor from his feet vp to his brest was come
The coold of deeth  þat hadde hym ouercome
And yet moore ouer  for in his armes two
The vital strengthe  is lost and al ago
Oonly the Intellect with oute moore
That dwelled in his herte  syk and soore
Gan faillen  whan the herte felte deeth
Dusked hise eyen two  and fayled breeth
But on his lady  yet caste he his eye
His laste word  was mercy Emelye
His spirit chaunged hous  and wente ther
As I cam neuere  I kan nat tellen wher
Therfore I stynte  I nam no dyuynystre
Of soules  fynde I nat in this Registre
Ne me ne lyst thilke opynyons to telle
Of hem  thogh þat they writen wher they dwelle
Arcite is coold  ther Mars his soule gye
Now wol I speken  forth of Emelye
 Shrighte Emelye  and howleth Palamon  
And Theseus  his suster took anon
Swownynge  and baar hire fro the corps away
What helpeth it to tarien forth the day
To tellen how she weepe  bothe eue and morwe
ffor in swich caas  wommen haue swich sorwe


Whan þat hir housbondes  been from hem ago
That for the moore part they sorwen so
Or ellis fallen  in swich a maladye
That at the laste  certeinly they dye
 Infinite  been the sorwes and the teerys
Of olde folk  and folk of tendre yeerys
In all the town for the deeth of this Theban
ffor hym ther wepeth bothe child a man
So greet wepyng was ther noon certayn
Whan Ector was broght al fressh yslayn
To Troye  allas the pitee þat was ther
Cracchynge of chekes  rentyng eek of heer
Why woldestow be deed  thise wommen crye
And haddest gold ynow  and Emelye
 No man  myghte gladen Theseus
Sauyng his olde fader Egeus
That knew  this worldes transmutacioun
As he hadde seyn it chaungen  bothe vp and down
Ioye after wo  and wo after gladnesse
And shewed hem  ensample and lyknesse
 Right as ther deyed neuere man  quod he
That he ne lyued in erthe  in som degree
Right so  ther lyued neuere man he seyde
In al this world  þat som tyme he ne deyde
This world nys but a thurghfare  ful of wo
And we been pilgrymes  passynge to and fro
Deeth is an ende  of euery worldly soore
And ouer al this  yet seyde he muchel moore
To this effect ful wysly  to enhorte
The peple  that they sholde hem reconforte
 Duc Theseus  with al his bisy cure
Caste now  wher that the sepulture
Of goode Arcite  may best ymaked be
And eek moost honurable  in his degree
And at the laste  he took conclusion  
That ther  as first Arcite and Palamon


Hadden for loue  the bataille hem bitwene
That in the selue groue  swoote and grene
Ther as he hadde  hise amorouse desires
His compleinte  and for loue his hote fyres
He wolde make a fyr  in which the office
ffuneral  he myghte al acomplice
And leet anoon comaunde  to hakke and hewe
The okes olde  and leyen hem on a rewe
In colpons  wel arrayed for to brenne
Hise officers  with swifte feet they renne
And ryde anoon  at his comandement
And after this  Theseus hath ysent
After a Beere  and it al ouerspradde
With clooth of gold  the richeste þat he hadde
And of the same suyte  he cladde Arcite
Vp on his handes  his gloues white
Eek on his heed  a coroune of laurer greene
And in his hand  a swerd ful bright and keene
He leyde hym bare the visage  on the beere
Ther with he weepe  þat pitee was to heere
And for the peple  sholde seen hym alle
Whan it was day  he broghte hym to the halle
That roreth  of the cryyng and the sown
Tho cam  this woful Theban Palamon
With flotry berd  and ruggy asshy heerys
In clothes blake  ydropped al with teerys
And passyng othere  of wepyng Emelye
The rufulleste  of al the compaignye
In as muche  as the seruyce sholde be
The moore noble  and ryche in his degree
Duc Theseus  leet forth thre steedes brynge
That trapped weren in steel al gliterynge
And couered with the armes  of daun Arcite
Vp on thise steedes  grete and whyte
Ther seten folk  of which oon baar his sheeld
Another his spere  vp on his hondes heeld


The thridde bar with hym  his bowe Turkeys
Of brend gold  was the caas  and eek the harneys
And ryden forth a paas  with sorweful cheere  
Toward the groue  as ye shul after heere
The nobleste of the Grekys  þat ther were
Vp on hir shuldres  carieden the beere
With slak paas  and eyen rede and weete
Thurgh out the Citee  by the maister streete
That sprad was al with blak and wonder hye
Right of the same  is the strete ywrye
Vp on the right hand  wente olde Egeus
And on that oother syde  Duc Theseus
With vessels in hir hand  of gold ful fyn
As ful of hony  melk  and blood and wyn
Eek Palamon  with ful greet compaignye
And after that  cam woful Emelye
With fyr in hande  as was that tyme the gyse
To do the office  of funeral seruyse
 Heigh labour  and greet apparaillynge
Was at the seruyce  and the fyr makynge
That with his grene tope  the heuene raughte
And twenty fadme of brede  the armes straughte
This is to seyn  the bowes  were so brode
Of stree first ther was leyd many a lode
But how the fyr was maked vp on highte
Ne eek the names  how the trees highte
As ook  ffyrre  Birch  Asp  Alder  holm  popler
Wylow  Elm  Plane  Assh  Box  Chestayn  lynde  laurer
Mapul  Thorn  Beech  hasyl  Ew  Whippultree
How they were feld  shal nat been told for me
Ne how the goddes  ronnen vp and doun
Desherited  of hir habitacioun
In which they woneden  in reste and pees
Nymphes  ffawnes  and Amadrides
Ne how the beestes  and the bryddes alle
ffledden  for fered  whan the wode was falle


Ne how the ground  agast was of the lyght
That was nat wont to seen the sonne bright
Ne how the fyr  was couched first with stree
And thanne with drye stikkes  clouen a three
And thanne with grene wode  and spicerye
And thanne with clooth of gold  and with perrye
And gerlandes hangynge  ful of many a flour  
The Mirre  thencens  with al so greet sauour
Ne how Arcite  lay among al this
Ne what richesse  aboute the body is
Ne how that Emelye  as was the gyse
Putte in the fyr  of funeral seruyse
Ne how she swowned  whan men made the fyr
Ne what she spak ne what was hir desir
Ne what Iuels  men in the fyr caste
Whan þat the fyr was greet and brente faste
Ne how somme caste hir sheeld  and somme hir spere
And of hir vestimentz  whiche þat they were
And coppes fulle of Milk  and wyn and blood
In to the fyr  þat brente as it were wood
Ne how the Grekys  with An huge route
Thries ryden  al the fyr aboute
Vp on the left hand  with a loud shoutynge
And thries  with hir speres claterynge
And thries  how the ladyes gonne crye
And how þat lad  was homward Emelye
Ne how Arcite  is brent to Asshen colde
Ne how that lychwake  was yholde
Al thilke nyght ne how the grekys pleye
The wake pleyes  ne kepe I noght to seye
Who wrastleth best naked  with oille enoynt
Ne who þat baar hym best in no disioynt
I wol nat tellen al  how  they goon
Hoom til Atthenes  whan the pleye is doon
But shortly to the poynt than wol I wende
And maken  of my longe tale an ende


 By proces  and by lengthe of certeyn yerys
Al stynt is  the moornynge and the terys
Of Grekys  by oon general assent
Thanne semed me  ther was a parlement
At Atthenes  vp on a certeyn point and caas
Among the whiche pointes  yspoken was
To haue  with certeyn contrees alliance
And haue fully  of Thebans obeisance
ffor which this noble Theseus anon
Leet senden  after gentil Palamon
Vnwist of hym  what was the cause and why  
But in his blake clothes  sorwefully
He cam at his comandement  in hye
Tho sente Theseus  for Emelye
 Whan they were set and hust was al the place
And Theseus  abiden hath a space
Er any word  cam from his wise brest
His eyen sette he ther as was his lest
And with a sad visage  he siked stille
And after that right thus he seyde his wille
 The firste moeuere  of the cause aboue
Whan he first made  the faire cheyne of loue
Greet was theffect and heigh was his entente
Wel wiste he why  and what ther of he mente
ffor with that faire cheyne of loue he boond
The fyr  the Eyr  the water  and the loond
In certeyn boundes  þat they may nat flee
That same Prince  and that moeuere quod he
Hath stabliced  in this wrecched world adoun
Certeine dayes  and duracioun
To al  that is engendred  in this place
Ouer the which day  they may nat pace
Al mowe they yet  tho dayes abregge
Ther nedeth  noon auctoritee to allegge
ffor it is proued  by experience
But þat me list declaren my sentence


Thanne may men wel  by this ordre discerne
That thilke moeuere  stable is and eterne
Wel may men knowe  but it be a fool
That euery part  is diryued from his hool
ffor nature  hath nat taken his bigynnyng
Of no partie  or of cantel of a thyng
But of a thyng  that parfit is and stable
Descendynge so  til it be corrumpable
And ther fore  for his wise purueiaunce
He hath  so wel biset his ordinaunce
That specis of thynges  and progressions
Shullen enduren  by successions
And noght eterne  with outen any lye
This maistow vnderstonde  and seen at Iye
 Loo the ook  that hath so long a norisshynge  
ffro the tyme  that it first gynneth sprynge
And hath so long a lyf  as ye may see
Yet at the laste  wasted is the tree
 Considreth eek  how þat the harde stoon
Vnder oure foot on which we ryde and goon
It wasteth  as it lyth by the weye
The brode Ryuer  som tyme wexeth dreye
The grete townes  se we wane and wende
Thanne se ye  þat al this thyng hath ende
Of man and womman  se we wel also
That nedeth  in oon of thise termes two
This is to seyn  in youthe  or ellis age
He moot be deed  the kyng as shal a page
Som in his bed  som in the depe see
Som in the large feeld  as ye may se
Ther helpeth noght al gooth that ilke weye
Thanne may I seyn  þat al this thyng moot deye
What maketh this but Iuppiter the kyng
That is Prince  and cause of alle thyng
Conuertyng  al vn to his propre welle
ffrom which he is diryued sooth to telle


And heer agayns  no creature on lyue
Of no degree  auailleth for to stryue
 Thanne is it wisdom  as it thynketh me
To maken vertu  of necessitee
And take it wel  þat we may nat eschue
And nameliche  that to vs alle is due
And who so gruccheth oght he dooth folye
And rebel is  to hym þat al may gye
And certeinly  a man hath moost honour
To dyen  in his excellence and flour
Whan he is siker  of his goode name
Thanne hath he doon  his freend ne hym no shame
And gladder oghte  his freend been of his deeth
Whan with honour  yolden is vp his breeth
Than whan his name  apalled is for age
ffor al forgeten is his vasselage
Thanne is it best as for a worthy fame
To dyen  whan he is best of name
 The contrarie of al this  is wilfulnesse
Why grucchen we  why haue we heuynesse
That goode Arcite  of chiualrie flour  
Departed is  with duetee  and with honour
Out of this foule prison  of this lyf
Why gruccheth heere  his cosyn and his wyf
Of his welfare  þat loueth hem so weel
Kan he hem thank nay good woot neuer a deel
That bothe his soule  and eek hem self offende
And yet they mowe  hir lustes nat amende
 What may I conclude  of this longe serye
But after wo  I rede vs to be merye
And thanken Iuppiter  of al his grace
And er we  departen from this place
I rede we make  of sorwes two
O parfit Ioye  lastynge euere mo
And loketh now  wher moost sorwe is her Inne
Ther wol I first amenden and bigynne


 Suster quod he  this is my ful assent
With al thauys  heer of my parlement
That gentil Palamon  youre owene knyght
That serueth yow  with wyl and herte myght
And euere hath doon  syn ye first hym knewe
That ye shal of youre grace vp on hym rewe
And taken hym  for housbond and for lord
Leen me youre hond  for this is oure acord
Lat se now  of youre wommanly pitee
He is  a kynges brother sone pardee
And thogh he were  a poure Bachiler
Syn he hath serued yow  so many a yeer
And had for yow  so greet aduersitee
It moste been considred  leueth me
ffor gentil mercy  oghte to passen right
 Thanne seyde he thus  to Palamon the knyght
I trowe  ther nedeth litel sermonyng
To make yow  assente to this thyng
Com neer  and taketh youre lady by the hond
Bitwixe hem  was maad anon the bond
That highte matrymoigne  or mariage
By al the conseil  and the Baronage
And thus  with alle blisse  and melodye
Hath Palamon  ywedded Emelye
And god  that al this world hath wroght  
Sende hym his loue  that hath it deere aboght
ffor now is Palamon  in alle wele
Lyuynge in blisse  in richesse  and in heele
And Emelye  hym loueth so tendrely
And he  hir serueth so gentilly
That was ther no word hem bitwene
Of Ialousie  or any oother teene
Thus endeth Palamon  and Emelye
And god saue  al this faire compaignye Amen
WHan that the knyght hadde thus his tale ytoold
In al the compaignie  nas ther yong ne oold
That he ne seyde  it was a noble Storie
And worthy  for to drawen to memorie
And namely  the gentils euerichon
 Oure hoost lough  and swoor so moot I gon
This gooth aright vnbokeled is the male
Lat se now  who shal telle another tale
ffor trewely  the game is wel bigonne
Now telleth ye sire Monk  if þat ye konne
Som what  to quite with the knyghtes tale
 The Millere  that fordronken was a pale
So that vnnethe  vp on his hors he sat
He nolde aualen  neither hood ne hat
Ne abiden no man  for his curteisye
But in Pilates voys  he gan to crye
And swoor by armes  and by blood and bones
I kan a noble tale  for the nones
With which  I wol now quite the knyghtes tale
 Oure Hoost saugh  þat he was dronke of ale
 And seyde  abyde Robyn leeue brother  
Som bettre man  shal telle vs first another
Abyde  and lat vs werken thriftily
 By goddes soule quod he  that wol nat I
ffor I wol speke  or ellis go my wey
 Oure Hoost answerde  tel on a deuele wey
Thow art a fool  thy wit is ouercome
 Now herkneth quod the Millere  alle and some
But first I make a protestacioun
That I am dronke  I knowe it by my sown
And therfore  if þat I mysspeke  or seye
Wite it  the ale of Southwerk I preye


ffor I wol telle  a legende and a lyf
Bothe of a Carpenter  and of his wyf
How þat a clerk hath set the wrightes cappe
 The Reue answerde  and seyde stynt thy clappe
Lat be  thy lewed dronken harlotrye
It is a synne  and eek a greet folye
To apeyren any man  or hym diffame
And eek to bryngen wyues  in swich fame
Thow mayst ynow  of othere thynges seyn
 This dronken Millere  spak ful soone ageyn
And seyde  leeue brother Osewold
Who hath no wyf  he is no Cokewold
But I seye nat therfore  þat thow art oon
Ther been ful goode wyues many oon
    
    
Why artow angry  wit my tale now
I haue a wyf pardee  as wel as thow
Yet nolde I  for the oxen in my plough
Take vp on me  moore than ynough
As demen of my self  þat I were oon
I wol bileeue wel  þat I am noon
An housbonde  shal noght been Inquisityf
Of goddes pryuetee  nor of his wyf
So he may fynde  goddes foyson there
Of the remenant nedeth noght enquere
 What sholde I moore seyn  but this Millere
He nolde his wordes  for no man forbere
But tolde his cherles tale  in his manere
Me athynketh  that I shal reherce it heere
And therfore  euery gentil wight I preye  
Demeth noght for goddes loue  þat I seye
Of yuel entente  but for I moot reherse
Hir tales alle  be they bet or werse
Or ellis falsen  som of my matere
And therfore  who so list it noght yhere


Turne ouer the leef  and chese another tale
ffor he shal fynde ynowe  grete and smale
Of storial thyng that toucheth gentilesse
And eek moralitee  and holynesse
Blameth noght me  if þat ye chese amys
The Millere is a cherl  ye knowe wel this
So was the Reue eek and othere mo
And harlotrye  they tolden bothe two
Auyseth yow  and put me out of blame
And eek men shal noght maken ernest of game
Whilom ther was dwellyng at Oxenford
A riche gnof that gestes heeld to bord
And of his craft he was a Carpenter
With hym ther was dwellynge a poure Scoler
Hadde lerned art but al his fantasie
Was turned  for to leere Astrologie
And koude  a certeyn of conclusions
To demen  by interrogacions
If þat men axed hym  in certein houres
Whan þat men sholde haue droghte  or ellis shoures
Or if men axed hym  what shal bifalle
Of euery thyng  I may nat rekene hem alle
 This clerk  was clepyd hende Nicholas
Of derne loue he koude  and of solas
And therto he was sleigh  and ful pryuee
And lyk a mayde meke  for to see
A chambre hadde he  in that hostelrie
Allone  withouten any compaignye
fful fetisly dight  with herbes swoote
And he hym self as sweete as is the roote
Of lycorys  or any Cetuale  
His Almageste  and bookes grete and smale
His Astrelabye  longynge for his Art
His Augrym stones  layen faire a part
On shelues couched  at his beddes heed
His presse  ycouered with a ffaldyng reed
And al aboue  ther lay a gay Sautrye
On which  he made a nyghtes melodye
So swetely  þat al the chambre roong
And Angelus ad virginem  he soong
And after that he soong the kynges note
fful often blissed was  his murye throte


And thus this swete clerk  his tyme spente
After his freendes fyndyng and his rente
 This Carpenter  hadde wedded newe a wyf
Which þat he louede  moore than his lyf
Of xviij yeer  she was of age
Ialous he was  and heeld hire narwe in Cage
ffor she was wilde and yong  and he was old
And demed hym self  been lyk a Cokewold
He knew nat Caton  for his wit was rude
That bad  man sholde wedde his similitude
Men sholde wedden  after hir estaat
ffor youthe and Elde  is often at debaat
But sith þat he  was fallen in the snare
He moste endure  as oother folk his care
 ffair was this yonge wyf  and ther with al
As any wesele  hir body gent and smal
A ceynt she werde  barred al of sylk
A barmclooth  as whit as morne Mylk
Vp on hir lendes  ful of many a goore
Whit was hir smok and broyden al bifoore
And eek bihynde  on hir coler aboute
Of col blak silk  withInne and eek withoute
The tapes  of hir white voluper
Were of the same sute  of hir coler
Hir filet brood of sylk and set ful hye
And sikerly  she hadde a likerous Iye
fful smale ypulled  were hir browes two
And tho were bent  and blake as is a slo
She was ful moore  blisful on to see  
Than is the newe  Pereionette tree
And softer  than the wolle is of a wether
And by hir girdel  heeng a purs of lether
Tasseled with silk  and perled with latoun
In al this world  to seken vp and doun
Ther nys no man so wys  þat koude thenche
So gay a Popelote  or swich a wenche


fful brighter was  the shynyng of hir hewe
Than in the Tour  the noble yforged newe
But of hir soong it was as loude and yerne
As any swalwe  sittyng on a Berne
Therto  she koude skippe  and make game
As any kyde  or Calf  folwynge his dame
Hir mouth was sweete  as Bragot or the meeth
Or hoord of Apples  leyd in hey or heeth
Wynsynge she was  as is a ioly Colt
Loong as a Mast  and vprighte as a bolt
A brooch she baar  vp on hir loue coler
As brood  as is the boos of a Bokeler
Hir shoes were laced  on hir legges hye
She was a Prymerole  a piggesnye
ffor any lord  to leggen in his bedde
Or yet for any good yeman to wedde
 Now sire and eft sire  so bifel the cas
That on a day  this hende Nicholas
ffil with this yonge wyf  to rage and pleye
Whil þat hir housbonde  was at Osneye
As clerkes been  ful subtil and ful queynte
And pryuely  he caughte hire by the queynte
And seyde ywys  but if ich haue my wille
ffor derne loue  of thee lemman I spille
And heeld hire harde  by the haunche bones
And seyde lemman  loue me al atones
Or I wol dyen  al so god me saue
And she sproong as a Colt dooth in the Traue
And with hir heed  she wryed faste awey
She seyde I wol nat kisse thee by my fey
Wy lat be quod ich  lat be Nicholas
Or I wol crye  out harrow and allas
Do wey youre handes  for youre curteisye  
 This Nicholas  gan mercy for to crye
And spak so faire  and profred hym so faste
That she hir loue  hym graunted atte laste


And swoor hir ooth  by Seint Thomas of Kent
That she wolde been  at his comaundement
Whan þat she may  hir leyser wel espie
Myn housbonde  is so ful of Ialousie
That but ye waite wel  and been pryuee
I woot right wel  I nam but deed quod she
Ye moste been ful derne  as in this cas
 Nay ther of  care thee noght quod Nicholas
A clerc hadde lutherly  biset his while
But if he koude  a Carpenter bigyle
And thus they been acorded and ysworn
To waite a tyme  as I haue told biforn
Whan Nicholas  hadde doon thus euerydel
And thakked hire  vp on the lendes wel
He kiste hir sweete  and taketh his sautrye
And pleyeth faste  and maketh melodye
 Thanne fil it thus  þat to the parissh chirche
Cristes owene werkes  for to wirche
This goode wyf  wente on an haliday
Hir forheed shoon  as bright as any day
So was it wasshen  whan she leet hir werk
 Now was ther of that chirche a parissh clerk
The which  þat was yclepid Absolon
Crul was his heer  and as the gold it shoon
And strouted as a ffanne  large and brode
fful streight and euene  lay his ioly shode
His rode was reed  hise eyen greye as goos
With Poules wyndow  coruen on his shoos
In hoses rede  he wente fetisly
Yclad he was  ful smal and proprely
Al in a kirtel  of a light waget
fful faire and thikke  been the pointes set
And ther vp on  he hadde a gay surplys
As whit as is the blosme vp on the rys
A murye child he was  so god me saue
Wel koude he laten blood  and clippe and shaue


And maken a chartre of lond  or Aquitaunce  
On twenty manere  koude he trippe and daunce
After the scole  of Oxenford tho
And with his legges  casten to and fro
And pleyen songes  on a smal Rubible
Therto he soong som tyme  a loud quynyble
And as wel  koude he pleye on a gyterne
In al the town  nas Brewhous ne Tauerne
That he ne visited  with his solas
Ther any gaylard tappestere was
But sooth to seyn  he was som del squaymous
Of fartyng  and of speche daungerous
 This Absolon  þat ioly was and gay
Gooth with a sencer  on the haliday
Sensynge the wyues  of the parisshe faste
And many a louely look  on hem he caste
And namely  on this Carpenters wyf
To looke on hire  hym thoughte a murye lyf
She was so propre and sweete and likerous
I dar wel seyn  if she hadde been a Mous
And he a cat he wolde hir hente anon
This parisshe clerk this ioly Absolon
Hath in his herte  swich a loue longynge
That of no wyf  ne took he noon offrynge
ffor curteisye  he seyde he wolde noon
The Moone  whan it was nyght ful brighte shoon
And Absolon  his gyterne  hath ytake
ffor paramours  he thoghte for to wake
And forth he gooth  iolyf and amorous
Til he cam  to the Carpenters hous
A litel after the cokkes hadde ycrowe
And dressed hym vp  by a shot wyndowe
That was  vp on the Carpenters wal
He syngeth  in his voys  gentil and smal
Now deere lady  if thy wille be
I prey yow  þat ye wol rewe on me


fful wel acordant to his giternynge
This Carpenter awook and herde hym synge
And spak vn to his wyf  and seyde anon
What Alison  herestow noght Absolon
That chaunteth thus  vnder oure boures wal  
 And she  answerde hir housbonde  ther with al
Yis god woot Iohn  I here it euerydel
This passeth forth  what wol ye bet than wel
ffro day to day  this ioly Absolon
So woweth hire  þat hym is wo bigon
He waketh al the nyght and al the day
He kembed his lokkes brode  and made hym gay
He woweth hire by meenes  and brocage
And swoor  he wolde been hir owene page
He syngeth brokkyng as a nyghtyngale
He sente hir pyment Meeth  and spiced Ale
And wafres pipyng hoot  out of the gleede
And for she was of towne  he profred meede
ffor som folk  wol be wonnen for richesse
And som for strokes  and som for gentilesse
Som tyme to shewe  his lightnesse and maistrye
He pleyeth Herodes  vp on a scaffold hye
But what auailleth hym  as in this cas
She loueth so  this hende Nicholas
That Absolon  may blowe the Bukkes horn
He ne hadde for his labour  but a scorn
And thus she maketh  Absolon hir Ape
And al his ernest  turneth til a Iape
fful sooth is this prouerbe  it is no lye
Men seith right thus  alwey the neighe slye
Maketh  the ferre leeue to be looth
ffor thogh þat Absolon  be wood or wrooth
By cause  þat he fer was from hir sighte
This neighe Nicholas  stood in his lighte
 Now bere thee wel  thow hende Nicholas
ffor Absolon  may waille  and synge allas


 And so bifel it on a Saterday
This Carpenter  was goon til Osenay
And hende Nicholas  and Alison
Acorded been  to this conclusion
That Nicholas  shal shapen hem a wile
This sely Ialous housbonde  to bigile
And if so be  this game wente aright
She sholde slepen  in his arm al nyght
ffor this was hir desir  and his also  
And right anoon  withouten wordes mo
This Nicholas  no lenger wolde tarie
But dooth ful softe  vn to his chambre carie
Bothe mete and drynke  for a day or tweye
And to hir housbonde  bad hir for to seye
If þat he axed  after Nicholas
She sholde seye  she nyste wher he was
Of al that day  she seigh hym nought with Iye
She trowed  þat he was in maladye
ffor  for no cry  hir mayde koude hym calle
He nolde answere  for no thyng þat myghte falle
 This passeth forth  al thilke Saterday
That Nicholas  stille in his chambre lay
And eet and sleepe  or dide what hym leste
Til Sonday  þat sonne gooth to reste
 This sely Carpenter  hath greet meruaille
Of Nicholas  or what thyng myghte hym aille
And seyde  I am adrad  by Seint Thomas
It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas
God shilde  þat he deyde sodeynly
This world is now  ful tikel sikerly
I seigh to day a corps  born to chirche
That now a monday last I seigh hym wirche
Go vp quod he  vn to his knaue anoon
Clepe at his dore  or knokke with a stoon
Looke how it is  and tel me boldely
 This knaue gooth hym vp  ful sturdily


And at the chambre dore  whil þat he stood
He cryde and knokked  as þat he were wood
What how  what do ye maister Nicholay
How may ye slepen  al the longe day
But al for noght he herde nat a word
An hole he foond  ful lowe vp on a bord
Ther as the Cat  was wont In for to crepe
And at that hole  he looked In ful depe
And atte laste  he hadde of hym a sighte
 This Nicholas  sat euere capyng vprighte
As he hadde kiked  on the newe moone
Adown he gooth  and tolde his maister soone
In what array  he saw this ilke man  
 This Carpenter  to blessen hym bigan
And seyde  help vs seinte ffrideswyde
A man woot litel  what hym shal bityde
This man is falle  with his Astromye
In som woodnesse  or in som Agonye
I thoghte ay wel  how þat it sholde be
Men sholde noght knowe  of goddes priuetee
Ye blissed be alwey  a lewed man
That noght but oonly his bileue kan
So ferde another clerk with Astromye
He walked in the feeldes  for to prye
Vp on the sterres  what ther sholde bifalle
Til he was  in a Marle pit yfalle
He saw nat that but yet by Seint Thomas
Me reweth sore  for hende Nicholas
He shal be rated  of his studiyng
If þat I may  by Ihesus heuene kyng
Get me a staf  þat I may vnderspore
Whil þat thow Robyn  heuest vp the dore
He shal out of his studyyng as I gesse
And to the chambre dore  he gan hym dresse
His knaue  was a strong carl  for the nones
And by the haspe  he haaf it vp atones


In to the floor  the dore fil anoon
This Nicholas  sat ay as stille as stoon
And euere caped vp  in to the Eyr
This Carpenter  wende he were in despeyr
And hente hym  by the sholdres myghtily
And shook hym harde  and cryde spitously
What Nicholay  what how looke adoun
Awake  and thenk on Cristes passioun
I crouche thee  from Elues and fro wightes
Therwith the nyght spel  seyde he anon rightes
On foure halues  of the hous aboute
And on the thresshfold  on the dore withoute
Ihesu crist and Seint Benedight
Blesse this hous  from euery wikked wight
ffor the nyghtesuerye  the white Pater noster
Where wentestow  seinte Petres suster
And at the laste  this hende Nicholas  
Gan for to sike soore  and seyde allas
Shal al the world  be lost eft soones now
 This Carpenter answerde  what seistow
What thenk  on god  as we doon men þat swynke
 This Nicholas answerde  fecche me drynke
And after  wol I speke in pryuetee
Of certein thyng  þat toucheth me and thee
I wol telle it  noon oother man certayn
 This Carpenter gooth doun  and comth agayn
And broghte of myghty ale  a large quart
And whan þat eech of hem  hadde dronke his part
This Nicholas  his dore faste shette
And doun the Carpenter  by hym he sette
And seyde  Iohn  myn hoost lief and deere
Thou shalt vp on thy trouthe  swere me heere
That to no wight thou shalt this conseil wreye
ffor it is cristes conseil  that I seye
And if thou telle it man thou art forlore
ffor this vengeaunce  thow shalt haue ther fore


That if thow wreye me  thow shalt be wood
 Nay Crist forbede it  for his holy blood
Quod tho this sely man  I nam no labbe
And thogh I seye  I nam nat lief to gabbe
Sey what thow wolt I shal it neuere telle
To child ne wyf  by hym that harwed helle
 Now Iohn quod Nicholas  I wol noght lye
I haue yfounde  in myn Astrologye
As I haue looked  in the moone bright
That now a monday next at quarter nyght
Shal falle a reyn  and that so wilde and wood
That half so greet was neuere Nowels flood
This world he seyde  in lasse than in an hour
Shal al be dreynt so hidous is the shour
Thus shal mankynde drenche  and lese hir lyf
 This Carpenter answerde  allas my wyf
And shal she drenche  allas myn Alisoun
ffor sorwe of this  he fil almoost adoun
And seyde  is ther no remedie in this cas
 Why yis for gode  quod hende Nicholas
If thow wolt werken  after loore and reed  
Thow mayst noght werken  after thyn owene heed
ffor thus seith Salomon  þat was ful trewe
Werk al by conseil  and thow shalt noght rewe
And if thow werken wolt by good consayl
I vndertake  withouten mast or sayl
Yit shal I saue hire  and thee and me
Hastow nat herd  how saued was Noe
Whan þat oure lord  hadde warned hym biforn
That al the world  with water sholde be lorn
 Yis quod this Carpenter  ful yore ago
 Hastow nat herd  quod Nicholas also
The sorwe of Noe  with his felaweshipe
Er þat he myghte  gete his wyf to shipe
Hym hadde leuere  I dar wel vndertake
At thilke tyme  than alle hise wetheres blake


That she hadde had a shipe  hir self allone
And therfore  wostow what is best to done
This axeth haste  and of any hastyf thyng
Men may noght preche  or maken tariyng
Anoon go gete vs faste  in to this In
A knedyng trogh  or ellis a kymelyn
ffor eech of vs  but looke þat they be large
In whiche we mowen swymme  as in a barge
And han therInne  vitaille suffisaunt
But for a day  fy on the remenaunt
The water shal aslake  and goon away
Aboute pryme  vp on the nexte day
But Robyn may nat wite of this  thy knaue
Ne eek thy mayde Gille  I may nat saue
Axe noght why  for thogh thou axe me
I wol noght tellen goddes pryuetee
Suffiseth thee  but if thy wittes madde
To han as greet a grace  as Noe hadde
Thy wif shal I wel sauen  out of doute
Go now thy wey  and speed thee heer aboute
But whan thou hast  for hire and thee and me
Ygeten vs  thise knedyng tubbes thre
Thanne shaltow hangen hem  in the roof ful hye
That no man  of oure purueiance espye
And whan thow thus hast doon  as I haue seyd  
And hast oure vitaille  faire in hem yleyd
And eek an Ax  to smyte the corde atwo
Whan þat the water cometh  þat we may go
And breke an hole  an heigh vp on the gable
Vn to the gardynward  ouer the stable
That we may frely  passen forth oure wey
Whan þat the grete shour  is goon awey
Thanne shaltow swymme  as murye I vndertake
As dooth the white doke  after his drake
Thanne woltow clepe  how Alison  how Iohn
Be murye  for the flood wol passe anon


And thou wolt seyn  hail maister Nicholay
Good morwe  I see thee wel  for it is day
And thanne shal we be lordes al oure lyf
Of al the world  as Noe and his wyf
But of o thyng  I warne thee ful right
Be wel auysed  on that ilke nyght
That we been entred  in to shippes bord
That noon of vs  ne speke noght a word
Ne clepe ne crye  but been in his prayere
ffor it is  goddes owene heste deere
Thy wyf and thow  mote hange fer atwynne
ffor þat bitwix yow  shal be no synne
Namoore in lookyng  than ther shal in dede
This ordinaunce is seyd  go god thee spede
Tomorwe at nyght whan men been alle aslepe
In to oure knedyng tubbes  wol we crepe
And sitten there  abidyng goddes grace
Go now thy wey  I haue no lenger space
To make of this  no lenger sermonyng
Men seyn thus  seend the wise and sey no thyng
Thow art so wys  it nedeth thee nat teche
Go saue oure lyf and that I thee biseche
 This sely Carpenter  gooth forth his wey
fful ofte he seyde  allas and weylaway
And to his wyf  he tolde his priuetee
And she was war  and knew it bet than he
What al this queynte cast was for to seye
But nathelees  she ferde as she wolde deye
And seyde allas  go forth thy wey anon  
Help vs to scape  or we been dede echon
I am thy trewe  verray wedded wyf
Go deere spouse  and help to saue oure lyf
 Lo which a greet thyng  is affeccion
Men may dyen  of ymaginacion
So depe  may impression be take
This sely Carpenter  bigynneth quake


Hym thynketh verrailiche  þat he may se
Noes flood  come walwyng as the see
To drenchen Alison  his hony deere
He wepeth  waileth  maketh sory cheere
He siketh  with ful many a sory swogh
And gooth  and geteth hym a knedyng trogh
And after  a tubbe and a kymelyn
And pryuely  he sente hem to his In
And heeng hem  in the roof in priuetee
His owene hand  he made laddres thre
To clymben  by the ronges and the stalkes
Vn to the tubbes  hangyng in the balkes
And hem vitailed  bothe trogh and tubbe
With breed and chese  and good ale in a Iubbe
Suffisynge right ynogh  as for a day
But er þat he hadde maad  al this array
He sente his knaue and  eek his wenche also
Vp on his nede  to london for to go
And on the monday  whan it drogh to nyght
He shette his dore  withouten candel lyght
And dressed alle thyng as it sholde be
And shortly  vp they clomben alle thre
They seten stille  wel a furlong way
Now Pater noster  clom seyde Nicholay
And clum quod Iohn  and clum seyde Alison
This Carpenter  seyde his deuocion
And stille he sit and biddeth his prayere
Awaitynge on the reyn  if he it heere
 The dede sleepe  for wery bisynesse
ffil on this Carpenter  right as I gesse
Aboute corfew tyme  or litel moore
ffor trauaillyng of his goost he groneth soore
And eft he routeth  for his heed myslay  
 Doun of the laddre  stalketh Nicholay
And Alison  ful softe adoun she spedde
Withouten wordes mo  they goon to bedde


Ther as the Carpenter  is wont to lye
Ther was the reuel  and the melodye
And thus lyth Alison  and Nicholas
In busynesse of myrthe  and in solas
Til that the belle of laudees  gan to rynge
And freres in the chauncel  gonne synge
 This parissh clerk this amorous Absolon
That is for loue  alwey so wo bigon
Vp on the monday  was at Osneye
With compaignye  hym to disporte and pleye
And axed vp on caas  a Cloistrer
fful pryuely  after Iohn the Carpenter
And he drogh hym a part out of the cherche
And seyde I noot I saugh hym here noght werche
Sith Saterday  I trowe þat he be went
ffor tymber  ther oure Abbot hath hym sent
ffor he is wont for tymber for to go
And dwellen atte graunge  a day or two
Or ellis  he is at his hous certeyn
Where þat he be  I kan noght soothly seyn
 This Absolon  ful iolyf was and lyght
And thoghte  now is tyme to wake al nyght
ffor sikerly  I saugh hym noght stirynge
Aboute his dore  syn day bigan to sprynge
So mote I thryue  I shal at Cokkes crowe
fful priuely  knokken at hys wyndowe
That stant ful lowe  vp on his boures wal
To Alison  now wol I tellen al
My loue longyng  for yit I shal nat mysse
That at the leeste wey  I shal hir kisse
Som manere confort  shal I haue parfay
My mouth hath icched  al this longe day
That is a signe of kissyng at the leeste
Al nyght me mette eek  I was at a feeste
Therfore I wol go slepe  an houre or tweye
And al the nyght than wol I wake and pleye


 Whan þat the firste cok hath crowe anon  
Vp rist  this ioly louere Absolon
And hym arrayeth gay  at point deuys
But first  he cheweth grayn and likorys
To smellen swete  er he hadde kembd his heer
Vnder his tonge  a trewe loue he beer
ffor ther by  wende he to be gracious
He rometh  to the Carpenters hous
And stille he stant vnder the shot wyndowe
Vn to his brest it raughte  it was so lowe
And ofte he cogheth  with a semy sown
What do ye hony comb  swete Alisoun
My faire bryd  my swete cynamone
Awaketh lemman myn  and speketh to me
Wel litel thynken ye  vp on my wo
That for youre loue  I swete ther I go
No wonder is  thogh þat I swelte and swete
I moorne  as dooth a lamb  after the tete
Ywis lemman  I haue swich loue longyng
That lyk a turtle trewe  is my moornyng
I may nat ete  namoore than a mayde
 Go fro the wyndow  Iakke fool she sayde
As help me god  it wol nat be com pa me
I loue another  and ellis I were to blame
Wel bet than thee  by Ihesu Absolon
Go forth thy wey  or I wol caste a stoon
And lat me slepe  a twenty deuele wey
 Allas quod Absolon  and weilawey
That trewe loue  was euere so yuel biset
Thanne kys me  syn þat it may be no bet
ffor Ihesus loue  and for the loue of me
 Woltow thanne  go thy wey therwith quod she
 Ye certes lemman  quod this Absolon
 Thanne make thee redy quod she  I come anon
    
    
 This Absolon  doun sette hym on his knees


And seyde  I am a lord  at alle degrees
ffor after this  I hope ther cometh moore
Lemman thy grace  and swete bryd thyn oore
 The wyndow she vndooth  and that in haste
Haue do quod she  com of and speed thee faste
Lest þat oure neghebores  thee espye  
 This Absolon  gan wipe his mouth ful drye
Derk was the nyght as pych  or as the cole
And at the wyndow  out she putte hir hole
And Absolon  hym fil no bet ne wers
But with his mouth  he kiste hir naked ers
fful sauourly  er he were war of this
Abak he sterte  and thoghte it was amys
ffor wel he wiste  a womman hath no berd
He felte a thyng al rogh  and longe yherd
And seyde fy allas  what haue I do
 Te hee quod she  and clapte the wyndow to
And Absolon  gooth forth a sory paas
 A berd  a berd  quod hende Nicholas
By goddes corpus  this gooth faire and wel
 This sely Absolon  herde euery del
And on his lippe  he gan for anger byte
And to hym self  he seyde I shal thee quyte
 Who rubbeth now  who froteth now his lippes
With dust with sond  with straw  with clooth  with chippes
But Absolon  þat seith ful ofte allas
My soule  bitake vn to Sathanas
But me were leuere  than al this town quod he
Of this despit awreken for to be
Allas quod he  allas I ne hadde ybleynt
His hote loue was coold  and al yqueynt
ffor fro that tyme  þat he hadde kist hir ers
Of paramours  he sette noght a kers
ffor he was heelyd  of his maladye
fful ofte paramours  he gan defye
And weep  as dooth a child þat is ybete
A softe paas  he went ouer the strete


Vn til a smyth  men clepen daun Gerueys
That in his forge  smythed plogh harneys
He sharpeth shaar  and cultour bisily
This Absolon  knokketh al esily
And seyde  vndo Gerueys and that anoon
 What who artow it am I Absolon
What Absolon  what Cristes swete tree
Why rise ye so rathe  ey benedicitee
What eyleth yow  som gay gerl  god it woot  
Hath broght yow thus  vp on the viritoot
By Seinte note  ye woot wel what I mene
 This Absolon  ne roghte nat a bene
Of al his pley  no word agayn he yaf
He hadde moore tow  on his dystaf
Than Gerueys knew  and seyde freend so deere
That hoote cultour  in the chymenee heere
As lene it me  I haue therwith to doone
I wol brynge it thee  agayn ful soone
 Gerueys answerde  certes were it gold
Or in a poke  nobles al vntold
Thow sholdest haue  as I am trewe Smyth
Ey Cristes foo  what wol ye do therwith
 Therof quod Absolon  be as be may
I shal wel telle it thee  another day
And caughte the cultour  by the colde stele
fful softe  out at the dore he gan to stele
And wente  vn to the Carpenters wal
He cogheth first and knokketh ther with al
Vp on the wyndow  right as he dide er
 This Alison answerde  Who is ther
That knokketh so  I warante it a theef
 Wy nay quod he god woot my swete lief
I am thyn Absolon  my derelyng
Of gold quod he  I haue thee broght a ryng
My moder yaf it me  so god me saue
fful fyn it is  and therto wel ygraue


This wol I yeuen thee  if thow me kisse
 This Nicholas  was risen for to pisse
And thoghte  he wolde amenden al the Iape
He sholde kisse his ers  er þat he scape
And vp the wyndow  dide he hastely
And out his ers  he putteth pryuely
Ouer the buttok  to the haunche bon
 And therwith  spak this clerk this Absolon
Spek swete herte  I noot noght wher thow art
This Nicholas  anoon leet fle a fart
As greet as it hadde been a thonder dent
That with the strook he was almoost yblent
And he was redy  with his Iren hoot  
And Nicholas  in the ers he smoot
Of gooth the skyn  an handbrede aboute
The hoote cultour  brende so his toute
That for the smert he wende for to dye
As he were wood  for wo he gan to crye
Help water  water  help for goddes herte
 This Carpenter  out of his slomber sterte
And herde oon cryen water  as he were wood
And thoghte allas  now cometh Nowelys flood
He sette hym vp  withoute wordes mo
And with his ax  he smoot the corde atwo
And down gooth al  he foond neither to selle
Ne breed ne ale  til he cam to the Celle
Vp on the floor  and there aswowne he lay
 Vp stirte hire  Alison and Nicholay
And cryden out and harrow  in the Strete
The neghebores  bothe smale and grete
In ronnen  for to gauren on this man
That aswowne lay  bothe pale and wan
ffor with the fal  he brosten hadde his arm
But stonde he moste  vn to his owene harm
ffor whan he spak  he was anon bore doun
With hende Nicholas and Alisoun


They tolden euery man  þat he was wood
He was agast so  of Nowelys flood
Thurgh fantasie  þat of his vanytee
He hadde yboght hym  knedyng tubbes thre
And hadde hem hanged  in the roof aboue
And þat he preyde hem  for goddes loue
To sitten in the roof  par compaignye
 The folk gan laughen  at his fantasye
In to the roof  they kiken and they cape
And turned al his harm  vn to a Iape
ffor what so  þat this Carpenter answerde
It was for noght no man his reson herde
With othes grete  he was so sworn adoun
That he was holden wood  in al the toun
ffor euery clerk  anon right heeld with oother
They seyde  the man was wood  my leeue brother
And euery wight gan laughen at this stryf  
Thus swyued  was the Carpenters wyf
ffor al his kepyng and his Ialousye
And Absolon  hath kist hir nether Iye
And Nicholas  is scalded in the toute
This tale is doon  and god saue al the route
WHan folk hadde laughen  at this nyce cas
Of Absolon  and hende Nicholas
Diuerse folk  diuersely they seyde
But for the moore part they lowe and pleyde
Ne at his tale I seigh no man hym greue
But it were oonly  Osewold the Reue
Bycause he was  of Carpenters craft
A litel Ire  is in his herte ylaft
He gan to grucche  and blamed it a lite
So the ik quod he  ful wel koude I thee quyte
With bleryng of a proud Millerys Iye
If þat me liste  speke of rybaudye
But ik am oold  me list no pleye for age
Gras tyme is doon  my fodder is now forage
This white tope  writeth myne olde yerys
Myn herte  is also mowled  as myne herys
But if ik fare  as dooth an Openers
That ilke fruyt is euer lenger the wers
Til it be roten  in Mollok  or in stree
We olde men  I drede so fare we
Til we be roten  kan we noght be rype
We hoppe alwey  whil þat the world wol pipe
ffor in oure wil  ther stiketh ever a nayl
To haue an hoor heer  and a grene tayl
As hath a leek  for thogh oure myght be goon
Oure wil desireth folie  euere in oon
ffor whan we may noght doon  than wol we speke
Yet in oure asshen olde  is fyr yreke
ffoure gleedes haue we  whiche I shal deuyse  
Auauntyng lyyng Anger Coueitise
Thise foure sparkles  longen vn to eelde
Oure lymes  mowe wel been vnweelde


But wil ne shal noght faillen  that is sooth
And yet I haue alwey  a coltes tooth
As many a yeer  as it is passed henne
Syn þat my tappe of lyf  bigan to renne
ffor sikerlik whan ik was bore anon
Deeth drogh the tappe of lyf  and leet it goon
And euere sith  hath so the tappe yronne
Til þat almoost  al empty is the tonne
The streem of lyf  now droppeth on the chymbe
The sely tonge  may wel rynge and chymbe
Of wrecchednesse  þat passed is ful yoore
With olde folk  saue dotage is namoore
 Whan þat oure hoost hadde herd this sermonyng
He gan to speke  as lordly as a kyng
He seyde  what amounteth al this wit
What shal we speke al day  of holy writ
The deuel made  a Reue for to preche
Or of a Soutere  a Shipman  or a leche
Sey forth thy tale  and tarie noght the tyme
Lo Depeford  and it is half wey pryme
Lo Grenewych  ther many a sherewe is Inne
It were al tyme  thy tale to bigynne
 Now sires  quod this Osewold the Reue
I pray yow alle  þat ye noght yow greue
Thogh I answere  and som del sette his howue
ffor leueful is  with force  force of showue
This dronken Myllere  hath ytoold vs heer
How þat  bigiled was a Carpenter
Perauenture in scorn  for I am oon
And by youre leue  I shal hym quyte anon
Right  in his cherles termes  wol I speke
I pray to god  his nekke mote tobreke
He kan wel  in myn eye  seen a stalke
But in his owene  he kan noght seen a balke

AT Trompyngton  nat fer fro Cantebrygge
Ther gooth a brook  and ouer that a brygge
Vp on the which brook  ther stant a Melle  
And this is verray soothe  þat I yow telle
A Millere was ther dwellyng many a day
As any Pecok he was proud and gay
Pipen he koude  and fisshe  and nettes beete
And torne coppes  and wel wrastle and sheete
And by his belt he baar a long Panade
And of a swerd  ful trenchaunt was the blade
A ioly poppere  baar he in his pouche
Ther was no man  for peril dorste hym touche
A Sheffeld thwitel  baar he in his hose
Round was his face  and camuse was his nose
As piled as an Ape  was his skulle
He was a Market betere  atte fulle
Ther dorste no wight hand vp on hym legge
That he ne swoor  he sholde anon abegge
A theef he was for sothe  of corn and mele
And þat a sleigh  and vsant for to stele
His name was hoten  deynous Symkyn
A wif he hadde  comen of noble kyn
The person of the toun  hir fader was
With hire he yaf  ful many a panne a bras
ffor þat Symkyn  sholde in his blood allye
She was yfostred  in a Nonnerye
ffor Symkyn  wolde no wyf as he sayde
But she were wel ynorissed and a mayde
To sauen  his estaat of yemanrye
And she was proud  and peert as is a pye
A ful fair sighte  was it vp on hem two
On halidayes  biforn hire wolde he go


With his tipet wounden aboute his heed
And she cam after  in a gyte of reed
And Symkyn  hadde hosen of the same
Ther dorste no wight clepen hire but dame
Was noon so hardy  þat wente by the weye
That with hire  dorste rage  or ones pleye
But if he  wolde be slayn of Symkyn
With panade  or with knyf or boydekyn
ffor Ialous folk  been perilouse eueremo
Algate  they wolde hir wyues wenden so
And eek  for she was som del smoterlich  
She was as diyne  as water in a dich
And ful of hoker  and of bismare
Hir thoghte  þat a lady sholde hir spare
What for hir kynrede  and hir nortelrye
That she hadde lerned  in the Nonnerye
A doghter hadde they  bitwix hem two
Of twenty yeer  with outen any mo
Sauyng a child  þat was of hal yeer age
In Cradel it lay and was a propre page
This wenche  thikke and wel ygrowen was
With camuse nose  and eyen greye as glas
With buttokes brode  and brestes rounde and hye
But right fair was hir heer  I wol nat lye
 The person of the toun  for she was so feir
In purpos was  to maken hire his heir
Bothe of his catel  and his Mesuage
And straunge he made it of hir mariage
His purpos was  for to bistowe hir hye
In to som worthy blood of Auncetrye
ffor holicherches good  moot been despended
On holicherches blood  þat is descended
Therfore he wolde his holy blood honoure
Thogh þat he  holy chirche sholde deuoure
 Greet sokne  hath this Millere out of doute
With whete and malt of al the lande aboute


And nameliche  ther was a greet Collegge
Men clepeth  the soler halle of Cantebregge
Ther was hir whete  and eek hir malt ygrounde
And on a day  it happed in a stounde
Syk was this maunciple  on a maladie
Men wenden wisly  þat he sholde dye
ffor which this Millere  stal bothe mele and corn
An hondred tyme  moore than biforn
ffor ther biforn  he stal but curteisly
But now  he was a theef outrageously
ffor which the wardeyn  chidde and made fare
But therof  sette the Millere noght a tare
He craked boost  and swoor it was noght so
Thanne were ther  yonge poure scolers two
That dwelten in the halle  of which I seye  
Testyf they were  and lusty for to pleye
And oonly  for hir myrthe and reuerye
Vp on the wardeyn  bisily they crye
To yeue hem leue  but a litel stounde
To go to Mille  and seen hir corn ygrounde
And hardily  they dorste leye hir nekke
The Millere  sholde noght stelen hem half a pekke
Of corn by sleighte  ne by force hem reue
And atte laste  the wardeyn yaf hem leue
Iohn highte that oon  and Aleyn highte that oother
Of oon town were they born  þat highte Strother
ffer in the North  I kan noght telle where
This Aleyn  maketh redy al his gere
And on an hors  the sak he caste anon
fforth gooth Aleyn the clerk and also Iohn
With good swerd  and with bokeler by his syde
Iohn knew the wey  hym neded no gyde
And at the Mille  the sak adoun he layth
 Aleyn spak first al hayl Symkyn in fayth
How fares thy faire doghter  and thy wyf
 Aleyn wel come  quod Symkyn by my lyf


And Iohn also  how now  what do ye here
 By god quod Iohn· Symond nede has na peere
Hym bihoues serue hym self  þat has na swayn
Or ellis  he is a fool  as clerkes sayn
Oure maunciple  I hope he wol be deed
Swa werkes ay  the wanges in his heed
And therfore is I come  and eek Alayn
To grynde oure corn  and carie it heem agayn
I pray yow  speed vs heythen  what ye may
 It shal be doon  quod Symkyn by my fay
What wol ye doon  whil þat it is in hande
By god  right by the hoper  wol I stande
Quod Iohn  and se how the corn gas In
Yet saw I neuere  by my fader kyn
How þat the hoper  wagges til and fra
 Aleyn answerde  Iohan wiltow swa
Thanne wol I be byneth  by my crown
And se  how þat the mele falles down
In to the trogh  that sal be my desport  
ffor Iohn in faith  I may been of youre sort
I is as ille a Millere  as ar ye
 This Millere  smyled of hir nycetee
And thoghte  al this nys doon  but for a wyle
They wene  þat no man may hem bigile
But by my thrift  yet shal I blere hir Iye
ffor al the sleighte  in hir Phislophye
The moore queynte crekys  þat they make
The moore wol I stele  whan I take
In stede of flour  yet wol I yeue hem bren
The grettest clerkes  been noght the wisest men
As whilom to the wolf thus spak the mare
Of al hir art counte I noght a tare
Out of the dore  he gooth ful pryuely
Whan þat he saugh his tyme  softely
He looketh vp and doun  til he hath founde
The clerkes hors  ther as it stood ybounde


Bihynde the Mille  vnder a leefsel
And to the hors  he gooth hym faire and wel
He strepeth of the bridel  right anon
And whan the hors was laus  he gynneth gon
Toward the fen  ther wilde mares renne
And forth with wehe  thurgh thikke and thenne
This Millere gooth ayein  no word he seyde
But dooth his note  and with the clerkes pleyde
Til þat hir corn  was faire and wel ygrounde
And whan the mele  was sakked and ybounde
 This Iohn gooth out and fynt his hors away
And gan to crye  harrow and weilaway
Oure hors is lost Alayn for goddes banes
Step on thy feet  com of man al atanes
Allas oure wardeyn  has his palfrey lorn
 This Alayn al forgat bothe mele and corn
Al was out of his mynde  his housbondrye
What whilk wey is he gane  he gan to crye
 The wyf cam lepyng Inward with a ren
She seyde allas  youre hors gooth to the fen
With wilde mares  as faste as he may go
Vnthank come on his hand  þat boond hym so
And he þat bettre  sholde haue knyt the reyne  
 Allas quod Iohn  Aleyn for Cristes peyne
Lay doun thy swerd  and I wol myn alswa
I is ful wight  God waat as is a ra
By god hert he sal nat scape vs bathe
Why ne had thow  pit the capil in the lathe
Il hail  by god Alayn  thow is a fonne
 This sely clerkes  haan ful faste yronne
Toward the fen  bothe Alayn and eek Iohn
And whan the Millere seigh  þat they were gon
He half a busshel  of hir flour hath take
And bad his wyf  go knede it in a cake
He seyde I trowe  the clerkes were aferd
Yet kan a Millere  maken a clerkes berd


ffor al his art ye lat hem goon hir weye
Lo where he gooth  ye lat the children pleye
They gete hym noght so lightly  by my croun
 Thise sely clerkes  rennen vp and doun
With keep  keep  stand  stand  Iossa warderere
Ga whistle thow  and I sal kepe hym heere
But shortly  til þat it was verray nyght
They koude noght thogh they dide al hir myght
Hir capyl cacche  he ran alwey so faste
Til in a dych  they caughte hym at the laste
 Wery and weet as beest is in the reyn
Comth sely Iohn  and with hym comth Aleyn
Allas quod Iohn  the day þat I was born
Now ar we dryuen  til hethyng and til scorn
Oure corn is stole  men wil vs foolis calle
Bothe the wardeyn  and oure felawes alle
And namely the Millere  weilawey
 Thus pleyneth Iohn  as he gooth by the wey
Toward the Mille  and Bayard in his hond
The Millere  sittyng by the fyr he fond
ffor it was nyght and ferther myghte they noght
But for the loue of god  they hym bisoght
Of herberwe and of ese  as for hir peny
 The Millere seide agayn  if ther be eny
Swich as it is  yet shal ye haue youre part
Myn hous is streyt but ye han lerned art
Ye kan by argumentz  make a place  
A myle brood  of twenty foot of space
Lat se now  if this place may suffise
Or make it rowm with speche  as is youre gyse
 Now Symond seyde this Iohn  by seint Cutberd
Ay is thou myrie  and that is faire answerd
I haue herd seye  men sal tak of twa thynges
Swilk as he fyndes  or tak swilk as he brynges
But specialy  I pray thee hoost deere
Get vs som mete and drynke  and make vs cheere


And we wol payen  trewely atte fulle
With empty hand  men may none haukes tulle
Lo heere oure siluer  redy for to spende
 This Millere in to town  his doghter sende
ffor ale and breed  and rosted hem a goos
And boond hir hors  it sholde namoore go loos
And in his owene chambre  hem made a bed
With shetes and with chalons  faire yspred
Noght from his owene bed  but ten foot or twelue
His doghter hadde a bed  al by hir selue
Right in the same chambre by and by
It myghte be no bet and cause why
Ther was no rowmer herberwe  in the place
They soupen  and they speken  hem to solace
And drynken euere stroong ale  at the beste
Aboute mydnyght  wente they to reste
Wel hath this Millere  vernysshed his heed
fful pale he was fordronke  and noght reed
He yexeth  and he speketh thurgh the nose
As he were  on the quakke  or on the pose
To bedde he goth  and with hym goth his wyf
As any Iay  she light was and iolyf
So was hir ioly whistle  wel ywet
The Cradel  at hir beddes feet is set
To rokken  and to yeue the child to sowke
And whan þat dronken  al was in the Crowke
To bedde wente  the doghter right anon
To bedde gooth Aleyn  and also Iohn
Ther nas namoore  hem neded no dwale
This Millere  hath so wisly bibbed ale
That as an hors  he snorteth in his sleepe  
Ne of his tayl bihynde  he took no keepe
His wyf bar hym  a burdon  a ful strong
Men myghten hir routyng heren a furlong
The wenche  routeth eek par compaignye
 Aleyn the clerc that herde this melodye


He poked Iohn  and seyde slepestow
Herd thow euere  slyk a sang er now
Lo swilk a conplyng  is ymel hem alle
A wilde fyr  on thair bodyes falle
Wha herkned euere  swilk a ferly thyng
Ye they sal haue  the flour of il endyng
This lang night ther tydes me na reste
But yet na force  al sal be for the beste
ffor Iohn seyde he  als euere moot I thryue
If þat I may  yon wenche wol I swyue
Som esement  has lawe shapen vs
ffor Iohn  ther is a lawe  þat says thus
That gif a man  in a point be agreued
That in another  he sal be releued
Oure corn is stoln  soothly it is na nay
And we han had  an ille fit to day
And syn I sal  haue naan amendement
Agayn my los  I wil haue esement
By goddes saule  it sal naan other be
 This Iohn answerde  Aleyn auyse thee
The Millere  is a perilous man he sayde
And if þat he  out of his sleep abrayde
He mighte doon vs bathe  a vileynye
 Aleyn answerde  I counte hym noght a flye
And vp he rist  and by the wenche he crepte
This wenche lay vp righte  and faste slepte
Til he so neigh was  er she myghte aspie
That it hadde been  to late for to crie
And shortly for to seyn  they were at oon
Now pley Aleyn  for I wol speke of Iohn
 This Iohn lith stille  a furlang wey or two
And to hym self he maketh routhe and wo
Allas quod he  this is a wikked Iape
Now may I seyn  þat I is but an ape
Yet has my felawe  som what for his harm  
He has the Milleris doghter  in his arm


He auntred hym  and has his nedes sped
And I lye  as a draf sak  in my bed
And whan this iape  is told another day
I sal ben halden  a daf a Cokenay
I wil arise and auntre it by my fayth
Vnhardy is vnsely  thus men sayth
 And vp he roos  and softely he wente
Vn to the Cradel  and in his hand it hente
And baar it softe  vn to his beddes feet
Soone after this  the wyf hir routynt leet
And gan awake  and wente hir out to pisse
And cam agayn  and gan hir Cradel mysse
And groped heer and ther  but she foond noon
Allas quod she  I hadde almoost mysgoon
I hadde almoost goon to the clerkes bed
Ey benedicite  thanne had I foule ysped
And forth she gooth  til she the Cradel fond
She gropeth alwey  forther with hir hond
And foond the bed  and thoghte noght but good
By cause  þat the Cradel by it stood
And nyste wher she was  for it was derk
But faire and wel  she creep in to the clerk
And lyth ful stille  and wolde haue caught a sleepe
WithInne a while  this Iohn the clerk vp leepe
And on this goode wyf  he leyth on soore
So murie a fyt ne hadde she nat ful yoore
He priketh harde and depe  as he were mad
This ioly lyf  han thise two clerkes lad
Til þat  the thridde cok bigan to synge
 Aleyn wax wery  in the dawenynge
ffor he hadde swonken  al the longe nyght
And seyde  fare wel Malyn swete wight
The day is come  I may no lenger byde
But eueremo  wher so I go or ryde
I is thyn awen clerk so haue I sel
 Now deere lemman quod she  go fare wel


But er thow go  o thyng I wol thee telle
Whan that thow wendest  homward by the Melle
Right at the entree  of the dore bihynde  
Thow shalt a Cake  of half a busshel fynde
That was ymaked  of thyn owene mele
Which þat I heelp  my sire for to stele
And good lemman  god thee saue and kepe
And with that word  almoost he gan to wepe
 Aleyn vp rist and thoghte er þat it dawe
I wol go crepen In  by my felawe
And fond the Cradel  with his hond anon
By god thoghte he  al wrang I haue mysgon
Myn heed is toty  of my swynk to nyght
That maketh me  þat I go noght aright
I woot wel by the Cradel  I haue mysgo
Here lyth the Millere  and his wyf also
And forth he gooth  on twenty deueleway
Vn to the bed  ther as the Millere lay
He wende haue cropen  by his felawe Iohn
And by the Millere  In he creep anoon
And caughte hym by the nekke  and softe he spak
He seyde thou Iohn  thow Swyneshed awak
ffor cristes saule  and here a noble game
ffor by that lord  þat called is Seint Iame
As I haue thries  in this shorte nyght
Swyued the Milleris doghter  bolt vpright
Whil thow hast as a coward been agast
 Ye false harlot quod the Millere hast
A false traytour  false clerk quod he
Thou shalt be deed  by goddes dignytee
Who dorste be so bold  to disparage
My doghter  that is come of swich lynage
And by the throte bolle  he caughte Alayn
And he hente hym  despitously agayn
And on the nose  he smoot hym with his fest
Doun ran the blody streem  vp on his brest


And on the floor  with nose and mouth tobroke
They walwen  as doon two pigges in a poke
And vp they goon  and doun agayn anoon
Til þat the Millere  sporned on a stoon
And doun he fil  bakward vp on his wyf
That wiste no thyng of this nyce stryf
ffor she was falle aslepe  a litel wight  
With Iohn the clerk  that waked hadde al nyght
And with the fal  out of hir sleepe she brayde
Help holy cros of Bromholm  she sayde
In manus tuas  lord to thee I calle
Awake Symond  the feend is on me falle
Myn herte is broken  help I nam but ded
Ther lyth oon vp on my wombe  and vp myn hed
Help Symkyn  for the false clerkes fighte
 This Iohn sterte vp  as faste as euere he myghte
And graspeth by the walles  to and fro
To fynde a staf  and she sterte vp also
And knew the estres  bet than dide this Iohn
And by the wal  a staf she foond anon
And saugh  a litel shymeryng of a light
ffor at an hole  in shoon the moone bright
And by that light she saugh hem bothe two
But sikerly  she nyste who was who
But as she saugh  a whit thyng in hir Iye
And whan she gan  this white thyng espye
She wende the clerk hadde wered a voluper
And with the staf  she drow ay ner and ner
And wende han hit  this Aleyn atte fulle
And smoot the Millere  on the piled skulle
That doun he gooth  and cryde harrow I dye
Thise clerkes bette hym wel  and lete hym lye
And greithen hem  and tooke hir hors anon
And eek hir mele  and on hir wey they gon
And at the Mille  yet they toke hir cake
Of half a busshel flour  ful wel ybake


 Thus is the proude Millere  wel ybete
And hath ylost the gryndyng of the whete
And payed for the souper  euerydel
Of Aleyn  and of Iohn  that bette hym wel
His wyf is swyued  and his doghter als
Lo which it is  a Millere to be fals
And therfore this prouerbe  is seyd ful sooth
Hym thar nat wene wel  þat yuele dooth
A gilour shal hym self  bigiled be
And god  that sitteth heighe in magestee
Saue al this compaignie  grete and smale  
Thus haue I quyt the Millere  in my tale
THe Cook of London  whil the Reue spak
ffor ioye hym thoughte  he clawed hym on the bak
Haha quod he  for Cristes passion
This Millere  hadde a sharpe conclusion
Vp on his argument of herbergage
Wel seyde Salomon  in his langage
Ne bryng nat euery man  in to thyn hous
ffor herberwyng by nyghte is perilous
Wel oghte a man  auysed for to be
Whom þat he broghte  in to his priuetee
I pray to god  so yeue me sorwe and care
If euer sith  I highte Hogge of ware
Herde I a Millere  bettre yset awerk
He hadde a iape of malice  in the derk
But god forbede  that we stynten heere
ffor if ye  vouche sauf to heere
A tale of me  that am a poure man
I wol yow telle  as wel as euere I kan
A litel iape  that fil in oure Citee
 Oure hoost answerde  and seyde I graunte it thee
Now tel on Roger  looke that it be good
ffor many a pastee  hastow laten blood
And many a Iakke of Douere  hastow soold
That hath been twies hoot and twies coold
Of many a pilgrym  hastow Cristes curs
ffor of thy persle  yet they fare the wors
That they han eten  with thy stubbul goos
ffor in thy shoppe  is many a flye loos
Now tel on  gentil Roger  by thy name
But yet I praye thee  be nat wrooth for game
A man may seye ful sooth  in game and pley
 Thow seist ful sooth  quod Roger by my fey


But sooth pley quade pley  as the fflemyng seith  
And therfore herry Bailly  by thy feith
Be thou nat wrooth  er we departen heer
Thogh þat my tale  be of an hostiler
But nathelees  I wol nat telle it yit
But er we parte  ywis thow shalt be quyt
And ther with al  he lough  and made cheere
And seyde his tale  as ye shal after heere
A Prentis  whilom dwelled in oure Citee
And of a craft of vitaillers was he
Gaillard he was  as goldfynch in the shawe
Broun as a berye  a propre short felawe
With lokkes blake  ykembd ful fetisly
Dauncen he koude  so wel and iolily
That he  was clepyd Perkyn Reuelour
He was  as ful  of loue and paramour
As is the hyue  of hony swete
Wel was the wenche  þat with hym myghte meete
At euery bridale  wolde he synge and hoppe
He loued bet the Tauerne  than the Shoppe
ffor  whan ther any ridyng was in Chepe
Out of the shoppe  thider wolde he lepe
Til þat he hadde  al the sighte yseyn
And daunced wel  he wolde noght come ageyn
And gadred hym  a meynee of his sort
To hoppe and synge  and maken swich disport
And ther  they setten steuene  for to meete
To pleyen at the dees  in swich a streete
ffor in the town  nas ther no Prentys
That fairer  koude caste a paire of dys
Than Perkyn koude  and therto he was free
Of his dispense  in place of pryuetee
That foond his maister wel  in his chaffare
ffor ofte tyme  he foond his box ful bare
ffor sikerly  a prentys reuelour
That haunteth dees  ryot or paramour
His maister  shal it in his shoppe abye  
Al haue he  no part of the Minstralcye
ffor thefte and riot  they been conuertible
Al konne he pleye  on Giterne  or Rubible


Reuel and trouthe  as in a lowe degree
They been ful wrothe al day  as men may see
 This ioly Prentys  with his Maister bood
Til he were neigh  out of his prentishood
Al were he snybbed  bothe erly and late
And som tyme  lad with reuel to Newgate
But atte laste  his maister hym bithoghte
Vp on a day  whan he his papir soghte
Of a prouerbe  that seith this same word
Wel bet is roten appul  out of hoord
Than þat it rotte  al the remenaunt
So fareth it  by a riotous seruaunt
It is ful lasse harm  to lete hym pace
Than he shende  alle the seruantz in the place
Ther fore  his maister gaf hym acquitaunce
And bad hym go  with sorw  and with meschaunce
And thus this ioly prentys  hadde his leeue
Now lat hym riote  al the nyght or leeue
And for ther nys no theef  withoute a lowke
That helpeth hym  to wasten and to sowke
Of that he brybe kan  or borwe may
Anon  he sente his bed  and his array
Vn to a compeer  of his owene sort
That loued dees  and reuel  and disport
And hadde a wyf  that heeld for contenaunce
A shoppe  and swyued for hir sustenaunce
Of this Cokes tale
maked Chaucer na
moore 
Experience  thogh noon Auctoritee
Were in this world  is right ynogh for me
To speke of wo  that is in mariage
ffor lordynges  sith þat I twelf yeer was of age
Thonked be god  that is eterne on lyue
Housbondes atte chirche dore  I haue had fyue
If I so ofte  myghte han wedded be
And alle were worthy men  in hir degree
But me was told certeyn  noght longe agon is
That sith þat Crist ne wente neuere but onys
To weddyng in the Cane of Galilee
That by the same ensample  taughte he me
That I ne sholde  wedded be but ones
 Herke eek  lo  which a sharp word for the nones
Bisyde a welle  Ihesus  god and man
Spak in repreeue of the Samaritan
 Thow hast yhad  fyue housbondes quod he
And that ilke man  which that now hath thee
Is nat thyn housbonde  thus he seyde certeyn
What that he mente therby  I kan nat seyn
But þat I axe  why þat the fifthe man
Was noon housbonde  to the Samaritan
How manye  myghte she han in mariage
Yet herde I neuere  tellen in myn age
  
Vpon this nombre  diffynycioun
Men may dyuyne  and glosen vp and doun
But wel I woot expres  withouten lye
God bad vs  for to wexe and multiplye
That gentil text kan I wel vnderstonde
 Eek wel I woot he seyde þat myn housbonde
Sholde lete  fader and moder and take to me
But of no nombre  mencion made he
Of Bigamye  or of Octogamye
Why sholde men thanne  speke of it vileynye
 Lo here  the wise kyng Dann Salomon
I trowe  he hadde wyues many oon
As wolde god  it leueful were to me  
To be refresshed  half so ofte as he
Which yifte of god hadde he  for alle hise wyuys
No man hath swich  that in this world alyue is
God woot this noble kyng as to my wit
The firste nyght hadde many a murye fit
With ech of hem  so wel was hym on lyue
Blessed be god  that I haue wedded fyue
Wel come the sixte  whan þat euere he shal
ffor sith I wol nat kepe me  chaast in al
Whan myn housbonde  is fro the world agon
Som cristen man  shal wedde me anon
ffor thanne thapostle seith  þat I am free
To wedde a goddes half  where it liketh me
He seith  that to be wedded is no synne
Bet is to be wedded  than to brynne
What rekketh me  theigh folk  seye vileynye
Of shrewed Lameth  and his bigamye
I woot wel  Abraham was an holy man
And Iacob eek as fer as euere I kan
And ech of hem  hadde wyues mo than two
And many another  holy man also
 Where kan ye seye  in any maner age
That heighe god  defended mariage
  
By expres word  I pray yow telleth me
Or where comanded he virgynytee
I woot as wel as ye  it is no drede
Thapostle  whan he speketh of maydenhede
He seyde  that precept therof  hadde he noon
Men may conseille a womman  to be oon
But conseillyng nys no comandement
He put it in oure owene Iuggement
ffor hadde god  comanded maydenhede
Thanne hadde he dampned weddyng with the dede
And certes  if ther were no seed ysowe
Virgynytee thanne  wherof sholde it growe
Poul dorste nat comanden  at the leeste
A thyng of which  his mayster yaf noon heeste
The dart is set vp for virgynytee
Cacche who so may  who renneth best lat se
But this word  is noght take of euery wight  
But ther as god  list yeue it of his myght
I woot wel  that thapostle was a mayde
But nathelees  thogh þat he wroot or sayde
He wolde  that euery wight were swich as he
Al nys but conseil  to virgynytee
And for to been a wyf  he yaf me leue
Of Indulgence  so nys it no repreue
To wedde me  if that my make dye
Withouten excepcion of bigamye
Al were it good  no womman for to touche
He mente  as in his bed  or in his couche
ffor peril is  bothe fyr and tow tassemble
Ye knowe  what this ensample may resemble
This al and som  he heeld virgynytee
Moore parfit than weddyng in freletee
ffreletee clepe I  but if þat he and she
Wolde leden  al hir lyf in chastitee
I graunte it wel  I haue noon enuye
Thogh maydenhede  preferre bigamye
  
It liketh hem to be clene  in body and goost
Of myn estat ne wol I make no boost
ffor wel ye knowe  a lord in his houshold
Ne hath nat euery vessel  al of gold
Somme been of tree  and doon hir lord seruyse
God clepeth folk to hym  in sondry wyse
And euerich  hath of god a propre yifte
Som this  som that as hym liketh shifte
Virgynytee  is greet perfeccion
And continence eek with deuocion
But Crist that of perfeccion  is welle
Bad nat euery wight he sholde go selle
Al that he hadde  and yeue it to the poore
And in swich wise  folwe hym and his foore
He spak to hem  that wol lyue parfitly
And lordynges  by youre leue  that am nat I
I wol bistowe  the flour of al myn age
In thactes  and in fruyt of mariage
 Telle me also  to what conclusion
Were membres maad  of generacion
And of so parfit wys a wight ywroght   
Trusteth right wel  they were nat maad for noght
Glose who so wole  and seye bothe vp and doun
That they were maad  for purgacioun
Of Vryne  and oure bothe thynges smale
Was eek to knowe  a femelle from a male
And for noon oother cause  sey ye  no
Thexperience  woot wel it is noght so
So that the Clerkes  be nat with me wrothe
I sey this  þat they maked been for bothe
That is to seyn  for office and for ese
Of engendrure  ther we nat god displese
Why sholde men ellis  in hir bokes sette
That man shal yelde  to his wyf hir dette
Now wherwith  sholde he make his paiement
If he ne vsed  his sely Instrument
  
Thanne were they maad  vpon a creature
To purge vryne  and eek for engendrure
 But I seye noght þat euery wight is holde
That hath swich harneys  as I to yow tolde
To goon  and vsen hem in engendrure
Thanne sholde men take  of Chastitee no cure
Crist was a mayde  and shapen as a man
And many a Seynt sith that the world bigan
yet lyued they euere  in parfit Chastitee
I nyl envie  no virgynytee
Lat hem be breed  of pured whete seed
And lat us wyues  hote Barlybreed
And yet with Barlybreed  Mark telle kan
Oure lord Ihesu  refresshed many a man
In swich estat as god hath clepyd vs
I wol perseuere  I nam nat precius
In wifhode  wol I vse myn Instrument
As frely  as my makere hath it sent
If I be daungerous  god yeue me sorwe
Myn housbonde  shal it han  bothe eue and morwe
Whan that hym list com forth and paye his dette
And housbonde  wol I haue  I wol nat lette
Which shal be  bothe  my dettour and my thral
And haue  his tribulacion  withal
Vpon his flessh  whil that I am his wyf  
I haue the power  duryng al my lyf
Vpon his propre body  and nat he
Right thus  thapostle  tolde it vnto me
And bad oure housbondes  for to loue vs wel
Al this sentence  me liketh euery del
Vp stirte the Pardoner  and that anon
Now dame quod he  by god and by Seint Iohn
Ye been a noble Prechour  in this cas
I was aboute  to wedde a wyf allas
What sholde I bye it  on my flessh so deere
Yet hadde I leuere  wedde no wyf to yeere
  
 Abyd quod she  my tale is nat bigonne
Nay  thow shalt drynken  of another tonne
Er þat I go  shal sauoure wors than Ale
And whan that I  haue toold thee forth my tale
Of tribulacion  in maryage
Of which I am expert in al myn age
This is to seye  my self hath been the whippe
Thanne maystow  chese  wheither þat thow wolt sippe
Of thilke tonne  that I shal abroche
Be war of it  er thow to neigh approche
ffor I shal telle ensamples  mo than ten
Who so þat nyle  be war by othere men
By hym  shal othere men corrected be
Thise same wordes  writeth Protholome
Rede in his Almageste  and take it there
 Dame I wolde pray yow  if youre wyl it were
Seyde this Pardoner  as ye bigan
Telle forth youre tale  spareth for no man
And techeth vs yonge men  of youre praktyke
 Gladly quod she  syn it may yow lyke
But that I praye  to al this compaignye
If that I speke  after my fantasye
As taketh nat agrief  of that I seye
ffor myn entente  nys but for to pleye
Now sire  thanne wol I telle yow forth my tale
As euere  moot I drynke  wyn or Ale
I shal seye sooth  tho housbondes þat I hadde
As three of hem were goode  and two were badde
The thre men  were goode  and ryche  and olde  
Vnnethe myghte they  the Statut holde
In which  that they were bounden vnto me
Ye woot wel  what I mene of this pardee
As help me god  I laughe whan I thynke
How pitously  a nyght I made hem swynke
And by my fey  I tolde of it no stoor
They hadde me yeuen  hir land and hir tresoor
  
Me neded nat do lenger diligence
To wynne hir loue  or doon hem reuerence
They loued me so wel  by god aboue
That I ne tolde  no deyntee of hir loue
A wys womman  wol bisye hire  euere in oon
To gete hir loue  ye ther as she hath noon
But sith I hadde hem  hoolly in myn hond
And sith that they  hadde yeuen me al hir lond
What sholde I take kepe  hem for to plese
But it were  for my profit and myn ese
I sette hem awerk by my fey
That many a nyght they songen weylawey
The bacon  was nat fet for hem I trowe
That som men han  in Essexe at Donmowe
I gouerned hem  so wel after my lawe
That ech of hem  ful blisful was and fawe
To brynge me  gaye thynges fro the ffeyre
They were ful glad  whan I spak to hem feyre
ffor god it woot I chidde hem spitously
 Now herkneth  how I bar me proprely
ye wise wyues  that konne vnderstonde
Thus sholde ye speke  and bere hem wrong on honde
ffor half so boldely  kan ther no man
Swere and lye  as a womman kan
I sey nat this  by wyues þat ben wyse
But if it be  whan they hem mysauyse
A wys wyf  if that she kan hir good
Shal bere hym an hond  the Cow is wood
And take witnesse  of hir owene mayde
Of hire assent but herkneth how I sayde
 Sire olde kaynard  is this thyn array
Why is  my Neghebores wyf so gay
She is honoured  ouer al ther she goth  
I sitte at hoom  I haue no thrifty cloth
What dostow  at my neghebores hous
Is she so fair  artow so amorous
  
What rowne ye with oure mayde  benedicite
Sire olde lechour  lat thy Iapes be
And if I haue  a gossib  or A freend
Withouten gilt ye chiden as a feend
If that I walke  or pleye vnto his hous
Thow comest hoom  as dronken as a mous
And prechest on thy bench  with yuel preef
Thow seyst to me  it is a greet mescheef
To wedde a poure womman  for costage
And if that she be ryche  of heigh parage
Thanne seistow  that it is a tormentrye
To suffre  hir pryde  and hir malencolye
And if þat she be fair  thow verray knaue
Thow seist that euery holour wol hire haue
She may no while  in chastitee abyde
That is assayled  vpon ech a syde
 Thow seyst som folk  desiren vs for richesse
Somme for oure shape  and somme for oure fairnesse
And somme  for she kan outher synge  or daunce
And somme  for gentillesse  and dalyaunce
Somme for hir handes  and hir armes smale
Thus goth al to the deuel  by thy tale
Thow seyst men may nat kepe a Castel wal
It may so longe  assaylled been ouer al
And if that she be foul  thow seyst þat she
Coueiteth euery man  that she may se
ffor as a Spaynel  she wol on hym lepe
Til that she fynde  som man hir to chepe
Ne noon so grey goos  goth ther in the lake
As seistow  wol be withoute make
And seyst it is an hard thyng for to wolde
A thyng that no man wol his thankes holde
Thus seistow lorel  whan thow goost to bedde
And that no wys man  nedeth for to wedde
Ne no man  that entendeth vnto heuene
With wilde thonder dynt and firy leuene
  
Moote thy welked nekke  be tobroke  
Thow seyst that droppyng houses  and eek smoke
And chidyng wyues  maken men to flee
Out of hir owene houses  a benedicitee
What eyleth  swich an old man for to chide
Thow seyst we wyues  wil oure vices hyde
Til we be fast and thanne we wol hem shewe
Wel may that be  a prouerbe of a shrewe
Thow seist þat Oxen  Asses  hors  and houndes
They been assayed  at dyuerse stoundes
Bacynes  lauours  er that men hem bye
Spoones  stooles  and al swich housbondrye
And so be pottes  clothes  and array
But folk of wyues  maken noon assay
Til they be wedded  olde dotard shrewe
And thanne seistow  we wil oure vices shewe
Thow seist also  that it displeseth me
But if that thow  wolt preise my beautee
And but thow powre  alwey vpon my face
And clepe me faire dame  in euery place
And but thow make a feeste  on thilke day
That I was born  and make me fressh and gay
And but thow do  to my norice honour
And to my chambrere · withInne my bour
And to my fadres folk  and his allyes
Thus seistow  olde barel ful of lyes
And yet of oure Apprentice  Iankyn
ffor his crispe heer  shynyng as gold so fyn
And for he squyereth me  bothe vp and doun
Yet hastow caught fals suspecioun
I wil hym nat thogh thow were deed to morwe
 But tel me this  why hidestow with sorwe
The keyes of thy Cheste  awey fro me
It is my good  as wel as thyn pardee
What wenestow  make an ydiote of oure dame
Now by that lord  that called is Seint Iame
  
Thow shalt noght bothe  thogh þat thow were wood
Be maister  of my body  and my good
That oon thow shalt forgo  maugree thyne eyen
What helpeth it of me enquere and spyen
I trowe  thow woldest lok me in thy chiste  
Thow sholdest seye  wyf go wher thee liste
Taak youre disport I nyl leue no talis
I knowe yow  for a trewe wyf Dame Alis
We loue no man  that taketh kepe  or charge
Wher þat we goon  we wol been at oure large
Of alle men  yblessed moote he be
The wise Astrologen  Daun Protholome
That seith this prouerbe  in his Almageste
Of alle men  his wisdom is hyeste
That rekketh nat who hath the world in hond
By this prouerbe  thow shalt vnderstonde
Haue thow ynogh  what thar thee rekke  or care
How myrily  that othere folkes fare
ffor certes  olde dotard  by youre leue
Ye shal han queynte  right ynogh at eue
He is to greet a nygard  that wil werne
A man to lighte a candle  at his lanterne
He shal han  neuer the lasse light pardee
Haue thow ynogh  thee thar nat pleyne thee
 Thow seist also  that if we make vs gay
With clothyng and with precious array
That it is peril  of oure chastitee
And yet with sorwe  thow most enforce thee
And seye thise wordes  in thapostles name
In habit maad with chastitee and shame
Ye wommen  shal apparaille yow quod he
And nat in tressed heer  and gay perree
As perlys  ne with gold  ne clothes ryche
After thy text ne after thy rubryche
I wol nat werke  as muche  as is a gnat
Thow seydest this  þat I was lyk a Cat
  
ffor who so wolde senge  a Cattes skyn
Thanne wolde the Cat wel dwellen in his In
And if the Cattes skyn  be slyk and gay
She wol nat dwelle in house  half a day
But forth she wole  er any day be dawed
To shewe hir skyn  and goon a Caterwawed
This is to seye  if I be gay sire shrewe
I wol renne out my borel for to shewe
Sire olde fool  what helpeth thee tespyen  
Thogh thow preye Argus  with his hundred eyen
To be my wardecorps  as he kan best
In feith  he shal nat kepe me  but me lest
Yet koude I make his berd  as mote I thee
 Thow seydest eek þat ther ben thynges three
The whiche thynges  troublen al this erthe
And that no wight may endure the ferthe
O leeue sire shrewe  Ihesu shorte thy lyf
Yet prechestow  and seist an hateful wyf
Yrekened is  for oon of thise myschaunces
Been ther  noone othere resemblaunces
That ye may likne  youre parables to
But if a sely wyf be oon of tho
 Thow liknest eek  wommanes loue to helle
To bareyne lond  ther water may nat dwelle
Thow liknest it also  to wilde fyr
The moore it brenneth  the moore it hath desyr
To consumen euery thyng þat brent wol be
Thow seist right as wormes shende a tree
Right so a wyf  destroyeth hir housbonde
This knowen they  that been to wyues bonde
 Lordynges  right thus  as ye han vnderstonde
Bar I stifly  myne olde housbondes on honde
That thus they seyden  in hir dronkenesse
And al was fals  but that I took witnesse
On Iankyn  and on my Nece also
O lord  the pyne I dide hem  and the wo
  
fful giltlees  by goddes swete pyne
ffor as an hors  I koude byte and whyne
I koude pleyne  and I was in the gilt
Or ellis  often tyme  I hadde been spilt
Who so that first to Mille comth  first grynt
I pleyned first so was oure werre stynt
They were ful glad  to excusen hem ful blyue
Of thyng of which they neuere agilte hir lyue
Of wenches  wolde I bern hem on honde
Whan that for syk they myghte vnnethe stonde
Yet tikled I his herte  for that he
Wende that I hadde had of hym  so greet chiertee
I swoor  that my walkyng out by nyghte  
Was for to espye  wenches that he dighte
Vnder that colour  hadde I many a myrthe
ffor al swich wit is yeuen vs in oure birthe
Deceite  wepyng spynnyng god hath yeue
To wommen kyndely  whil they may lyue
And thus  of o thyng I auante me
At ende  I hadde the bet in ech degree
By sleighte  or force  or by som maner thyng
As by continuel murmur  or grucchyng
Namely abedde  hadden they meschaunce
Ther wolde I chide  and do hem no plesaunce
I wolde no lenger  in the bed abyde
If that I felte his arm  ouer my syde
Til he hadde maad  his raunceon vnto me
Thanne wolde I suffre hym  do his nycetee
And therfore  euery man  this tale I telle
Wynne who so may  for al is for to selle
With empty hond  men may none haukes lure
ffor wynnyng wolde I al his lust endure
And make me  a feyned appetit
And yet in bacon  hadde I neuere delit
That made me  that euere I wolde hem chyde
For thogh the Pope  hadde seten hem bisyde
  
I wolde noght spare hem  at hir owene bord
ffor by my trouthe  I quytte hem  word for word
As help me  verray god omnipotent
Togh I right now  sholde make my testament
I ne owe hem nat a word  that it nys quyt
I broghte it so aboute  by my wit
That they moste yeue it vp  as for the beste
Or ellis  hadde we neuere been in reste
ffor thogh he looked  as a wood leon
yet sholde he faille  of his conclusion
 Thanne wolde I seye  good lief taak keepe
How mekely  looketh Wilkyn oure scheepe
Com neer my spouse  lat me ba thy cheke
Ye sholden be  al pacient  and meke
And han  a swete spyced conscience
Sith ye so preche  of Iobes pacience
Suffreth alwey  syn ye so wel kan preche  
And but ye do  certeyn we shal yow teche
That it is fair  to han a wyf in pees
Oon of vs two  moste bowen doutelees
And sith a man  is moore resonable
Than womman is  ye mosten been suffrable
What eyleth yow  to grucche thus and grone
Is it for ye wolde haue  my queynte allone
Wy taak it al  lo haue it euery del
Peter I shrewe yow  but ye loue it wel
ffor if I wolde selle  my bele chose
I koude walke  as fressh as is a rose
But I wol kepe it for youre owene tooth
Ye be to blame  by god I sey yow sooth
Swiche manere wordes  hadde we on honde
Now wol I speke  of my ferthe housbonde
My ferthe housbonde  was a reuelour
This is to seyn he hadde a paramour
And I was yong and ful of ragerye
Stibourne and strong and ioly as a pye
  
How koude I daunce  to an harpe smale
And synge ywys  as any nyghtyngale
Whan I hadde dronke  a draghte of swete wyn
Metellyus  the foule cherl the swyn
That with a staf  birafte his wyf hir lyf
ffor she drank wyn  though I hadde been his wyf
Ne sholde nat han daunted me fro drynke
And after wyn  on Venus moste I thynke
ffor also siker  as coold engendreth hayl
A likerous mouth  moste han a likerous tayl
In womman vynolent  is no defence
This knowen lechours  by experience
But lord crist whan þat it remembreth me
Vpon my youthe  and on my iolytee
It tikeleth me  aboute myn herte roote
Vnto this day  it dooth myn herte boote
That I haue had my world  as in my tyme
But age allas  that al wole enuenyme
Hath me biraft my beautee  and my pith
Lat go farwel  the deuel go therwith
The flour is goon  ther is namoore to telle  
The bren as I best kan  now moste I selle
But yet to be right murye  wol I fonde
Now wol I tellen  of my ferthe housbonde
 I seye I hadde in herte gret despit
That he  of any oother had delit
But he was quyt by god and by Seint Ioce
I made hym  of the same wode a troce
Nat of my body  in no foul manere
But certeynly  I made folk swich chiere
That in his owene grece  I made hym frye
ffor angre  and for verray Ialousye
By god  in erthe  I was his purgatorie
ffor which I hope  his soule be in glorie
ffor god it woot he sat ful ofte and soong
Whan þat his shoo  ful bitterly hym wroong
  
Ther was no wight saue god and he  þat wiste
In many wise  how soore I hym twiste
He deyde  whan I cam fro Ierusalem
And lyth ygraue  vnder the roode beem
Al is his toumbe  noght so curyus
As was the sepulcre  of hym Daryus
Which that Appellus  wroghte subtilly
It nys but wast to burye hym preciously
Lat hym fare wel  god gyue his soule reste
He is now  in his graue  and in his cheste
Now  of my fifthe housbonde  wol I telle
God lat his soule  neuere come in helle
And yet was he to me  the mooste shrewe
That feele I  on my rybbes al by rewe
And euere shal  vnto myn endyng day
But in oure bed  he was so fressh and gay
And ther with al  so wel koude he me glose
Whan that he wolde  han my bele chose
That thogh he hadde me bet on euery bon
He koude wynne agayn  my loue anon
I trowe I loued hym best for that he
Was of his loue  daungerous to me
We wommen han  if that I shal nat lye
In this matere  a queynte fantasye
Wayte what thyng we may nat lightly haue  
Ther after  wol we crye al day  and craue
fforbede vs thyng and that desiren we
Preesse on vs faste  and thanne wol we fle
With daunger  oute we  al oure chaffare
Greet prees at Market  maketh deere ware
And to greet cheepe  is holden at litel prys
This knoweth euery womman  that is wys
 My fifthe housbonde  god his soule blesse
Which þat I took for loue  and no rychesse
He som tyme  was a clerk of Oxenford
And hadde laft scole  and wente at hom to bord
  
With my gossyb  dwellyng in oure town
God haue hir soule  hir name was Alisoun
She knew myn herte  and eek my pryuetee
Bet than oure parysshe preest as mote I thee
To hire biwreyed I  my conseil al
ffor hadde myn housbonde  pissed on a wal
Or doon a thyng  that sholde haue cost his lyf
To hire  and to another worthy wyf
And to my Nece  which þat I loued wel
I wolde han toold  his conseil euery del
And so I dide  ful often  god it woot
That made his face  often reed and hoot
ffor verray shame  and blamed hym self for he
Hadde toold to me  so greet a pryuetee
 And so bifel  that ones in a lente
So often tymes  I to my gossyb wente
ffor euere yet I louede to be gay
And for to walke  in March  Auerylle  and May
ffrom hous to hous  to here sondry tales
That Iankyn Clerk and my gossyb dame Alys
And I my self  in to the feeldes wente
Myn housbonde was at london  al that lente
I hadde  the bettre leyser for to pleye
And for to se  and eek for to be seye
Of lusty folk what wiste I wher my grace
Was shapen for to be  or in what place
Therfore  I made my visitacions
To Vigilies  and to processions
To prechyng eek  and to thise pilgrymages  
To pleyes of myracles  and to mariages
And wered vp on  my gaye scarlet gytes
Thise wormes  ne thise moththes  ne thise Mytes
Vpon my peril  frete hem neuer a del
And wostow  why  for they were vsed wel
 Now wol I tellen forth  what happed me
I seye  that in the feeldes walked we
  
Til trewely  we hadde swich daliaunce
This clerk and I  that of my purueiaunce
I spak to hym  and seyde hym  how that he
If I were wydewe  sholde wedde me
ffor certeynly  I seye for no bobaunce
Yet was I neuere  withouten purueiaunce
Of mariage  nof othere thynges eek 
I holde a mouses herte  noght worth a leek
That hath but oon hole  for to sterte to
And if that faille  thanne is al ydo

My Dame taught me  that sotilte
And eke I seide  I mette of him al nyght
He wold han slayn me  as I lay vp right
And al my bed  was ful of verray blod
But ȝet I hope  that ȝe shuln do me good
ffor blod bytokeneth gold  as me was taught
And al was fals  I dremed of it right nought
But as I folwed ay  my dames loore
As wel of that  as of othere thynges more
But now sire  lat me se  what shal I seyn
A ha by god  I haue my tale ageyn
 Whan that my fourthe housbonde  was a beere
I weep algate  and made sory cheere
As wyues mooten  for it is vsage
And with my couerchief  couered my visage
But for that I was  purueyed of a make
I wepte but smal  and that I vndertake
 To chirche was myn housbonde  born a morwe
With neghebores  that for hym maden sorwe
And Iankyn oure clerk  was oon of tho
As help me god  whan that I saw hym go
After the beere  me thoughte he hadde a payre
Of legges and of feet so clene and fayre
That al myn herte  I gaf vnto his hoold
He was I trowe  twenty wynter oold
  
And I was fourty  if I shal seye sooth
But yit I hadde alwey  a coltes tooth
Gat tothed I was  and that bicam me weel
I hadde the preente  of Seynt Venus seel
As help me god I was a lusty oon
And fayr and ryche  and yong and wel bigoon
And trewely  as myne housbondes tolde me  
I hadde the beste quonyam  myghte be

In feelyng  and myn hert is Marcien
Venus me ȝaf my lust  my likerousnesse
And Mars ȝaf me  my sturdy hardynesse
Myn ascendent was Taur  and Mars therInne
Allas  allas  that euere loue was synne
I folwed ay  myn Inclinacion
By vertu  of my constellacion
That made me  I koude noght withdrawe
My chambre of Venus  from a good felawe

And also  in a nother pryue place
ffor god so wysely  be my sauacioun
I louede neuere  by no discrecioun
But euere folwed  myn appetit
Al were he short  long blak or whiȝt
I toke no kepe  so that he liked me
How poore he was  ne eke of what degree
 What sholde I seye  but at the Monthes ende
This ioly clerk  Iankyn þat was so hende
Hath wedded me  with greet solempnytee
And to hym yaf I  al the lond and fee
That euere was me yeuen  ther bifore
But afterward  repented me ful sore
He nolde suffre  no thyng of my list
By god  he smoot me ones  on the lyst
ffor that I rente  out of his book a leef
That of the strook myn ere weex al deef
  
Stibourne I was  as is a leonesse
And of my tonge  a verray Iangleresse
And walke I wolde  as I hadde doon biforn
ffrom hous to hous  althogh he hadde it sworn
ffor which  he often tymes  wolde preche
And me  of olde Romayn gestes teche
How he Symplicius Gallus  lafte his wif
And hire forsook for terme of al his lif
Noght but for open heueded he hir say
Lokynge out at his dore  vpon a day
 Another Romayn  tolde he me by name
That for his wyf  was at a Someres game
Withouten his wityng  he forsook hire eke
And thanne wolde he  vpon his Bible seke
That ilke prouerbe  of Ecclesiaste
Where he comandeth  and forbedeth faste
Man shal nat suffre his wyf  go roule aboute
Thanne wold he seye right thus  withouten doute
Who so þat buyldeth his hous  al of salwes
And priketh his blynde hors  ouer the falwes
And suffreth his wyf  to go seken halwes
Is worthy  to ben hanged on the galwes
But al for noght I sette noght an hawe  
Of his prouerbe  nof his olde sawe
Ny wolde nat of hym corrected be
I hate hym  þat my vices telleth me
And so doon mo  god woot of vs than I
This made hym  with me wood al outrely
I nolde noght forbere hym  in no cas
 Now wol I sey yow sooth  by Seint Thomas
Why þat I rente  out of his book a leef
ffor which  he smoot me so  þat I was deef
He hadde a book þat gladly nyght and day
ffor his disport he wolde rede alway
He clepyd it Valerie and Theofraste
At which book he logh alwey ful faste
  
And eek ther was  som tyme a clerk at Rome
A Cardynal  that highte Seint Ierome
That made a book agayn Iovinian
In which book eek ther was Tertulan
Crisippus  Trotula  and Helowys
That was Abbesse  nat fer fro Parys
And eek the parables  of Salomon
Ouydes art and bokes many on
And alle thise were bounden  in o volume
And euery nyght and day  was his custume
Whan he hadde leyser  and vacacion
ffrom oother  worldly ocupacion
To reden in this book of wikked wyues
He knew of hem  mo legendes and lyues
Than been of goode wyues in the Bible
ffor trusteth wel  it is an inpossible
That any clerk wol speke good of wyues
But if it be  of holy seintes lyues
Nof noon oother womman  neuer the mo
Who peynted the leon  tel me who
By god  if wommen  hadden writen stories
As clerkes han  withInne hir oratories
They wolde han writen of men  moore wikkednesse
Than al the mark of Adam may redresse
The children  of Mercurie and Venus
Been in hir wirkyng ful contrarius
Mercurie loueth  wysdam and science  
And Venus loueth  Riot and dispence
And for hir diuerse  disposicion
Ech faileth  in ootheres exaltacion
And thus god woot Mercurie is desolat
In pisces  wher venus is exaltat
And venus faileth  ther Mercurie is reysed
Therfore no womman  of no clerk is preysed
The clerk whan he is old  and may noght do
Of venus werkes  worth his olde sho
  
Thanne sit he doun  and writ in his dotage
That wommen  kan nat kepe hir mariage
 But now to purpos  why I tolde thee
That I was beten  for a book pardee
Vpon a nyght Iankyn þat was oure sire
Redde on his book as he sat by the fire
Of Eua first þat for hir wikkednesse
Was al mankynde  broght to wrecchednesse

That bought vs  with his hert blod agayn
Loo heere expres of wommen  may ȝe fynde
That womman was the losseof al mankynde
 Tho redde he me  how Sampson loste his herys
Slepynge  his lemman kitte it with hir sherys
Thurgh which treson  loste he bothe hise eyen
 Tho redde he me  if that I shal nat lyen
Of hercules  and of his Dianyre
That caused hym  to sette hym self a fyre
 No thyng forgat he  the sorwe and wo
That Socrates  hadde with his wyues two
How Xantippa  caste pisse vpon his heed
This sely man sat stille  as he were deed
He wipte his heed  namoore dorste he seyn
But er that thonder stynte  comth a reyn
 Of Phasifpha  that was the queene of Crete
ffor shrewednesse  hym thoughte the tale swete
ffy spek namoore  it is a grisly thyng
Of hire horrible lust and hir likyng
 Of Clitermystra  for hir lecherye
That falsly  made hir housbonde for to dye
He redde it with ful good deuocioun
 He tolde me eek for what occasioun
Amphiorax  at Thebes loste his lyf
Myn housbonde  hadde a legende of his wyf
 Exiphilem  that for an Ouche of gold  
Hath priuely  vnto the grekys told
  
Wher þat hir housbonde  hidde hym in a place
ffor which  he hadde at Thebes sory grace
 Of lyma tolde he me  and of lucie
They bothe  made hir housbondes for to dye
That oon for loue  that oother was for hate
Lyma hir housbonde  on an euen late
Empoysoned hath  for þat she was his fo
Lucya likerous  loued hir housbonde so
That for he sholde alwey  vpon hir thynke
She yaf hym  swich a manere loue drynke
That he was deed  er it were by the morwe
And thus algates  housbondes han sorwe
 Thanne tolde he me  how þat oon latumyus
Compleygned  vnto his felawe Arrius
That in his gardyn  growed swich a tree
On which he seyde  how þat hise wyues thre
Honged hem self  for hertes despitus
 O leeue brother  quod this Arrius
yif me a plante  of thilke blessed tree
And in my gardyn  planted shal it be
 Of latter date of wyues  hath he red
That somme han slayn  hir housbondes in hir bed
And lete hir lechour  dighte hire al the nyght
Whan þat the corps  lay in the floor vp ryght
 And somme  han dryuen nayles in hir brayn
Whil þat they sleepe  and thus they han hem slayn
 Somme han hem yeuen poysoun  in hir drynke
He spak moore harm  than herte may bithynke
And ther with al  he knew of mo prouerbes
Than in this world  ther growen gras or herbes
Bet is quod he  thyn habitacioun
Be with a leon  or a foul dragoun
Than with a womman  vsyng for to chide
Bet is quod he  hye in the roof abyde
Than with an angry wyf  down in the hous
They been so wikked  and contrarious
  
They haten  that hir housbondes loueth ay
He seyde  a womman  cast hir shame away
Whan she cast of hir smok and forther mo  
A fair womman  but she be chaast also
Is lyk a gold ryng in a sowes nose
Who wolde wene  or who wolde suppose
The wo  that in myn herte was and pyne
 And whan I say  he wolde neuere fyne
To reden  on this cursed book al nyght
Al sodeynly  thre leues  haue I plyght
Out of his book right as he radde  and eke
I with my fist so took  on the cheke
That in oure fyr he fil bakward adown
And he vp stirte  as dooth a wood leoun
And with his fest he smoot me on the heed
That in the floor  I lay as I were deed
And whan he say  how stille þat I lay
He was agast and wolde haue fled his way
Til atte laste  out of my swowgh I brayde
O hastow slayn me  false theef I sayde
And for my land  thus hastow mordred me
Er I be deed  yet wol I kisse thee
 And neer he cam  and kneled faire adown
And seyde  deere suster Alisoun
As help me god  I shal thee neuere smyte
That I haue doon  it is thy self to wyte
fforyeue it me  and that I thee biseke
And yet eft soones  I hitte hym on the cheke
And seyde theef thus muchel am I wreke
Now wol I dye  I may no lenger speke
 But at the laste  with muchel care and wo
We fille acorded  by vs seluen two
He yaf me  al the brydel in myn hond
To han the gouernance  of hous and lond
And of his tonge  and his hond also
And made hym brenne his book anon right tho
  
And whan that I hadde  geten vnto me
By maistrye  al the soueraynetee
And þat he seyde  myn owene trewe wyf
Do as thee lust the terme of al thy lyf
Keepe thyn honour  and keepe eek myn estaat
After that day  we hadde neuere debaat
God help me so  I was to hym as kynde  
As any wyf  from Denmark vnto Inde
And also trewe  and so was he to me
I pray to god  that sit in magestee
So blesse his soule  for his mercy deere
Now wol I seye my tale  if ye wol heere
The frere logh  whan he hadde herd al this
Now dame quod he  so haue I ioye  or blys
This is a long preamble  of a tale
And whan the Somnour  herde the frere gale
 Lo quod the Somnour  goddes armes two
A frere  wol entremette hym euere mo
Loo goode men  a flye  and eek a frere
Wol falle in euery dyssh and matere
What spekestow  of preambulacioun
What amble  or trotte  or pees  or go sit doun
Thow lettest oure disport in this manere
 Ye woltow so  sir Somnour  quod the frere
Now by my feith  I shal er that I go
Telle of a Somnour  swich a tale  or two
That al the folk shal laughen in this place
 Now ellis frere  I wol bishrewe thy face
Quod this Somnour  and I bishrewe me
But if I telle tales  two or thre
Of freres  er I come to Sydyngborne
That I shal make  thyn herte for to morne
  
ffor wel I woot thy pacience is gon
 Oure hoost cryde pees  and that anon
And seyde  lat the womman  telle hir tale
Ye fare as folk that dronken ben of Ale
Do dame  tel forth youre tale  and that is best
 Al reddy sire quod she  right as yow lest
If I haue licence  of this worthy frere
 Yis dame quod he  tel forth  and I wol heere  
IN tholde dayes  of the kyng Arthour
Of which that Britons  speken greet honour
Al was this land  fulfild of ffairye
The Elf queene  with hir ioly compaignye
Daunced ful ofte  in many a grene mede
This was  the olde opynyon  as I rede
I speke  of many hundred yerys ago
But now kan no man  se none Elues mo
ffor now the grete charitee  and prayeres
Of lymytours  and othere holy freres
That serchen  euery lond and euery streem
As thikke  as motes in the sonne beem
Blessynge halles  chambres  kichenes boures
Citees  Burghes  Castels  hye Toures
Thropes  Bernes  Shipnes  dayeryes
This maketh  þat ther been no fairyes
ffor ther as wont to walken was an Elf
Ther walketh now  the lymytour hym self
In vndermelys  and in morwenynges
And seith his matyns  and his holy thynges
As he gooth  in his lymytacioun
Wommen  may go saufly vp and down
In euery bussh  or vnder euery tree
Ther is noon oother Incubus  but he
And he ne wol doon hem  but dishonour
 And so bifel  that this kyng Arthour
Hadde in his hous  a lusty Bachiler
That on a day  cam ridyng fro Ryuer
  
And happed that allone  as he was born
He say a mayde  walkynge hym biforn
Of which mayde  anoon maugree hir hed
By verray force  he rafte hir maydenhed
ffor which oppressioun  was swich clamour
And swich pursuyte  vnto the kyng Arthour
That dampned was this knyght for to be deed
By cours of lawe  and sholde han lost his heed
Par auenture  swich was the statut tho  
But that the queene  and othere ladyes mo
So longe preyden  the kyng of grace
Til he his lyf  hym graunted in the place
And yaf hym to the queene  al at hir wille
To chese  wheither she wolde  hym saue or spille
The queen thanked the kyng with al hir might
And after this  thus spak she to the knyght
Whan that she saw  hir tyme vpon a day
Thow standest yet quod she  in swich array
That of thy lyf  yet hastow no suretee
I graunte thee lyf  if thow kanst tellen me
What thyng is it þat wommen moost desiren
Be war  and keepe thy nekke boon from Iren
And if thow kanst nat  tellen me anon
Yet wol I yeue thee leue  for to gon
A twelf monthe and a day  to seche and lere
An answere suffisant in this matere
And seuretee wol I han  er that thow pace
Thy body  for to yelden  in this place
 Wo was this knyght and sorwefully he siketh
But what he may nat doon  al as hym liketh
And atte laste  he chees hym for to wende
And come agayn  right at the yeres ende
With swich answere  as god wolde hym purueye
And taketh his leue  and wendeth forth his weye
He seketh euery hous  and euery place
Where as he hopeth  for to fynde grace
  
To lerne  what thyng wommen loue moost
But he ne koude  arryuen in no coost
Where as he myghte fynde  in this matere
Two creatures  acordyng in feere
 Somme seyden  wommen louen best richesse
Somme seyde honour  somme seyde Iolifnesse
Somme riche array  somme lust abeddo
And ofte tyme  to be widwe and wedde
Somme seyde  that oure herte  is moost esed
Whan that we been  yflatered and yplesed
He gooth ful ny the sothe  I wol nat lye
A man shal wynne vs best  with flaterye
And with attendaunce  and with bisynesse  
Been we ylymed  bothe moore and lesse
 And somme seyn  þat we louen best
ffor to be free  and do as vs lest
And that no man  repreue vs of oure vice
But seye þat we be wise  and no thyng nyce
ffor trewely  ther is noon of vs alle
If any wight wolde clawe vs on the galle
That we nyl like  for he seith vs sooth
Assay  and he shal fynde it that so dooth
ffor be we  neuer so vicious  withInne
We wol be holden wise  and clene of synne
 And somme seyn  that greet delit han we
ffor to be holden  stable and eek secree
And in o purpos  stedefastly to dwelle
And nat biwreye thyng that men vs telle
But that tale  is nat worth a Rake stele
Pardee  we wommen  konne no thyng hele
Witnesse on Mida  wol ye heere the tale
 Ouyde  amonges othere thynges smale
Seyde  Mida  hadde vnder his longe herys
Growynge vp on his heed  two Asses erys
The which vice he hidde  as he best myghte
fful sotilly  from euery mannes sighte
  
That saue his wyf  ther wiste of it na mo
He loued hire moost and trusted hire also
He preyed hire  that to no creature
She sholde tellen  of his diffigure
 She swoor hym nay  for al this world to wynne
She nolde do  that vileynye  or syn
To make hir housbonde  han so foul a name
She nolde nat telle it for hir owene shame
But nathelees  hir thoughte þat she dyde
That she so longe  sholde a conseil hyde
Hir thoughte  it swal so soore aboute hir herte
That nedely  som word  hir moste asterte
And sith  she dorste nat telle it to no man
Doun to a Marys  faste by she ran
Til she cam there  hir herte was a fyre
And as a Bitore  bombleth in the Myre
She leyde hir mouth  vnto the water down  
Biwrey me nat thow water with thy sown
Quod she  to thee I telle it and namo
Myn housbonde  hath longe Asses erys two
Now is myn herte al hool  now it is oute
I myghte no lenger  kepe it out of doute
Heere may ye see  thogh we a tyme abyde
Yet out it moot we kan no conseil hyde
The remenant of the tale  if ye wol heere
Redeth Ouyde  and ther ye may it leere
 This knyght of which my tale is specially
Whan that he say  he myghte nat come ther by
This is to seye  what wommen louen moost
WithInne his brest ful sorweful was the goost
But hom he gooth  he myghte nat soiorne
The day was come  that homward moste he torne
And in his wey  it happed hym to ryde
In al this care  vnder a fforest syde
Wher as he say  vp on a daunce go
Of ladyes xxiiij and yet mo
  
Toward the whiche daunce  he drow ful yerne
In hope  that som wisdom sholde he lerne
But certeynly  er he cam fully there ·
Vanysshed was this daunce  he nyste where
No creature say he  that bar lyf
Saue on the grene  he say sittynge a wyf
A fouler wight ther may no man deuyse
Agayn the knyght this olde wyf gan ryse
And seyde sire knyght heer forth ne lyth no wey
Tel me  what þat ye seken by youre fey
Par auenture  it may the bettre be
This olde folk konne muchel thyng quod she

Koude ye me wisse  I wolde wel quyte youre hyre
 Plight me thy trouthe  here in myn hand quod she

Thow shalt it do  if it lye in thy myght
And I wol telle it yow  er it be nyght
 Haue here my trouthe  quod the knyght I graunte  
 Thanne quod she  I dar me wel auaunte
Thy lyf is sauf for I wole stonde ther by
Vpon my lyf the queene wol seye as I
Lat see  which is the prouddeste of hem alle
That wereth on  a couerchief  or a calle
That dar seye nay  of that I shal thee teche
Lat vs go forth  withouten lenger speche
Tho rowned she  a pistel in his ere
And bad hym to be glad  and haue no fere
 Whan they be comen to the Court this knyght
Seyde  he hadde holde his day  as he had hight
And redy was his answere  as he sayde
fful many a noble wyf and many a mayde
And many a widwe  for þat they ben wise
The queene hir self  sittyng as Iustise
  
Assembled been  this answere for to here
And afterward  this knyght was bode appere
To euery wight comanded was silence
And that the knyght sholde telle in audience
What thyng that worldly wommen louen best
This knyght ne stood nat stille as dooth a best
But to his question  anon answerde
With manly voys  that al the court it herd
 My lige lady  generally quod he
Wommen desire  to haue souereyntee
As wel  ouer hir housbonde  as hir loue
And for to been in maistrie  hym aboue
This is youre mooste desir  thogh ye me kille
Dooth as yow list I am here at youre wille
 In al the Court ne was ther wyf ne mayde
Ne wydwe  that contraryed that he sayde
But seyden  he was worthy han his lyf
 And with that word  vp stirte that olde wyf
Which that the knyght say sittyng on the grene
Mercy quod she  my souereyn lady queene
Er that youre Court departe  do me right
I taughte this answere  vnto the knyght
ffor which  he plighte me his trouthe there
The firste thyng I wolde hym requere
He wolde it do  if it laye in his myght  
Bifore the court thanne preye I thee sire knyght
Quod she  that thow me take vnto thy wyf
ffor wel thow woost that I haue kept thy lyf
If I seye fals  sey nay vpon thy fey
 This knyght answerde  allas and weilawey
I woot right wel  that swich was my biheste
ffor goddes loue  as chees a newe requeste
Taak al my good  and lat my body go
 Nay thanne quod she  I shrewe vs bothe two
ffor thogh þat I be foul  old  and poore
I nolde for al the metal  ne for oore
  
That vnder erthe is graue  or lith aboue
But if thy wyf I were  and eek thy loue
 My loue quod he  nay my dampnacion
Allas  that any of my nacion
Sholde euere  so foule disparaged be
But al for noght thende is this  that he
Constreyned was  he nedes moste hir wedde
And taketh his olde wyf  and goth to bedde
 Now wolden som men  seye par auenture
That for my necligence  I do no cure
To tellen yow  the ioye  and al tharray
That at the feste  was that ilke day
To which thyng shortly  answere I shal
I seye  ther nas no ioye  ne feste at al
Ther nas but heuynesse  and muche sorwe
ffor priuely  he wedded hire on morwe
And al day after  hidde hym as on Owle
So wo was hym  his wyf looked so foule
 Greet was the wo  the knyght hadde in his thoght
Whan he was with his wyf  a bedde ybroght
He walweth  and he turneth to and fro
His olde wyf lay smylyng euere mo
And seyde  o deere housbonde benedicite
ffareth euery knyght thus with his wyf as ye
Is this the lawe  of kyng Arthures hous
Is euery knyght of his  thus daungerous
I am youre owene loue  and youre wyf
I am she  which that saued hath youre lyf
And certes  yet ne dide I yow neuere vnright  
Why fare ye thus with me  this firste nyght
Ye faren lyk a man  hadde lost his wit
What is my gilt for goddes loue tel it
And it shal ben amended  if I may
 Amended quod this knyght allas nay  nay
It wol nat ben amended neuere mo
Thow art so loothly  and so old also
  
And therto comen  of so lowe a kynde
That litel wonder is  thogh I walwe and wynde
So wolde god  myn herte wolde breste
 Is this quod she  the cause of youre vnreste
 Ye certeynly quod he  no wonder is
 Now sire quod she  I koude amende al this
If that me liste  er it were dayes thre
So wel ye myghte  bere yow vnto me
 But for ye speken of swich gentillesse
As is descended  out of old richesse
That therfore  sholden ye be gentil men
Swich errogance  is nat worth an hen
Looke who þat is  moost vertuous alway
Pryuee and apert and moost entendeth ay
To do  the gentil dedes  þat he kan
Taak hym  for the gentileste man
Crist  wol we clayme of hym oure gentilesse
Nat of oure eldres  for hir old richesse
ffor thogh they yeue vs  al hir heritage
ffor which we clame  to been of hir parage
Yet may they nat biquethe  for no thyng
To noon of vs  hir vertuous lyuyng
That made hem  gentil men ycalled be
And bad vs  folwen hem in swich degree
 Wel kan  the wise poete of fflorence
That highte Dant speken in this sentence
Lo  in swich manere rym  is Dantes tale
fful selde vp riseth  by his branches smale
Prowesse of man  for god of his prowesse
Wole  that of hym  we clayme oure gentilesse
ffor of oure eldres  may we no thyng clayme
But temporel thyng that man may hurte and mayme
Eek euery wight woot this as wel I  
If gentilesse  were planted naturelly
Vnto a certeyn lynage  doun the lyne
Pryuee and apert thanne wolde they neuere fyne
  
To doon  of gentilesse  the faire office
They myghte do  no vileynye or vice
 Taak fyr  and bere it in the derkeste hous
Bitwix this  and the mount of kaukasous
And lat men shette the dores  and go thenne
Yet wol the fyr  as faire lye and brenne
As twenty thousand men  myghte it biholde
His office naturel  ay wol it holde
Vp peril of my lyf til that it dye
Here may ye se wel  how þat genterye
Is nat annexed  to possession
Sith folk ne doon hir operacion
Alwey  as dooth the fyr lo in his kynde
ffor god it woot men may wel often fynde
A lordes sone  do shame and vileynye
And he þat wol han prys  of his gentrye
ffor he was born  of a gentil hous
And hadde hise eldres  noble and vertuous
And nyl hym seluen  do no gentil dedis
Ne folwen his gentil Auncestre  that deed is
He nys nat gentil  be he duc or Erl
ffor vileynes synful dedes  maken a cherl
ffor gentilesse  nys but renomee
Of thyne Auncestres  for hir hye bountee
Which is straunge thyng for thy persone
Thy gentilesse  cometh fro god allone
Thanne comth  oure verray gentilesse of grace
It was no thyng biquethe vs  with oure place
Thenketh how noble  as seith Valerius
Was thilke  Tullius hostillius
That out of pouerte  roos to heigh noblesse
Redeth Senek and redeth eek Boece
Ther shul ye seen expres  þat no drede is
That he is gentil  that dooth gentil dedis
And therfore  leue housbonde  I thus conclude
Al were it that myne Auncestres weren rude
  
Yet may the hye god  and so hope I   
Graunte me grace  to lyuen vertuously
Thanne am I gentil  whan þat I bigynne
To lyuen vertuously  and weyue synne
 And ther as ye  of pouerte me repreue
The hye god  on whom þat we bileue
In wilful pouerte  chees to lyue his lyf
And certes euery man  mayden  or wyf
May vnderstonde  þat Ihesus heuene kyng
Ne wolde nat chese  a vicious lyuyng
Glad pouerte  is an honeste thyng certeyn
This wol Senek and othere clerkes seyn
Who so þat halt hym payd  of his pouerte
I holde hym riche  al hadde he nat a sherte
He that coueiteth  is a poure wight
ffor he wolde han  that is nat in his myght
But he þat noght hath  ne coueiteth haue
Is riche  al thogh we holde hym but a knaue
Verray pouerte  is synne proprely
Iuuenal seith  of pouerte myrily
 The poure man  whan he gooth by the weye
Biforn the theues  he may synge and pleye
Pouerte is hateful good  and as I gesse
A ful greet bryngere  out of bisynesse
A greet amendere eek of Sapience
To hym  that taketh it in pacience
Pouerte is thyng al thogh it seme elenge
Possession  that no wight wol chalenge
Pouerte ful often  whan a man is lowe
Maketh hym self  and eek his god to knowe
Pouerte  a spectacle is  as thynketh me
Thurgh which he may  his verray freendes se
And therfore sire  syn þat I noght yow greue
Of my pouerte  namoore ye me repreue
 Now sire  of elde ye repreue me
And certes sire  thogh noon auctoritee
  
Were in no book ye gentils of honour
Seyn  þat men an old wight sholde doon fauour
And clepe hym fader  for youre gentilesse
And Auctours  shal I fynden  as I gesse
 Now ther ye seye  that I am foul and old  
Thanne drede yow noght to been a Cokewold
ffor filthe and elde  also mote I thee
Been grete wardeyns  vpon chastitee
But nathelees  syn I knowe youre delit
I shal fulfille  youre worldly appetit
 Chees now quod she  oon of thise thinges tweye
To han me foul and old  til that I deye
And be to yow  a trewe humble wyf
And neuere yow displese  in al my lyf
Or ellis  ye wol han me  yong and fair
And take youre auenture  of the repair
That shal be to youre hous  by cause of me
Or in som oother place  may wel be
Now chees your seluen  wheither þat yow liketh
 This knyght auyseth hym  and soore siketh
But atte laste  he seyde in this manere
My lady and my loue  and wyf so deere
I putte me  in youre wise gouernance
Cheseth youre self which þat may be moost plesance
And moost honour to yow  and me also
I do no fors  the wheither of the two
ffor as yow liketh  it suffiseth me
 Than haue I gete  of yow maistrye  quod she
Syn I may chese  and gouerne as me lest
 Ye certes wyf quod he  I holde it best
 Kys me quod she  we be no lenger wrothe
ffor by my trouthe  I wol be to yow bothe
This is to seyn  ye bothe fair and good
I pray to god  that I mote steruen wood
But I to yow  be al so good and trewe
As euere was wyf syn þat the world was newe
  
And but I be to morn  as fair to sene
Ay any lady  Emperice  or Queene
That is bitwix the Est and eek the West
Do with my lyf and deth  right as yow lest
Cast vp the Curtyn  looke how þat it is
And whan the knyght say verraily al this
That she so fair was  and so yong therto
ffor ioye he hente hire  in his armes two
His herte bathed  in a bath of blisse  
A thousand tyme a rewe  he gan hir kisse
And she obeyed hym  in euery thyng
That myghte do hym plesance  or likyng
And thus they lyue  vnto hir lyues ende
In parfit ioye  and Ihesu crist vs sende
Housbondes meke  yonge  and fressh a bedde
And grace  touerbyde hem that we wedde
And eek I praye Ihesu shorte hir lyues
That noght wol be gouerned  by hir wyues
And olde  and angry nygardes of dispence
God sende hem soone  verray pestilence  
This worthy lymytour  this noble frere
He made al wey  a manere louryng cheere
Vp on the Somnour  but for honestee
No vileyns word  as yet to hym spak he
But atte laste  he seyde vnto the wyf
Dame quod he  god yeue yow right good lyf
Ye han heer touched  al so mote I thee
In scole matere  greet difficultee
Ye han seyd muche thyng right wel I seye
But dame  here as we ryden by the weye
Vs nedeth nat to speken  but of game
And lete Auctoritees  on goddes name
To prechyng and to scole of clergye
But if it like  to this compaignye
I wol yow  of a Somnour telle a game
Pardee  ye may wel knowe by the name
That of a Somnour  may no good be sayd
I praye  that noon of yow  be ypayd
A somnour  is a rennere vp and doun
With mandementz  for fornicacioun
And is ybet at euery townes ende
 Oure hoost tho spak  a sire  ye sholde be hende
And curteys  as a man of youre estaat  
In compaignye  we wol no debaat
Telleth youre tale  and lat the Somnour be
 Nay quod the Somnour  lat hym seye to me
What so hym list whan it comth to my lot
By god  I shal hym quyten euery grot
I shal hym telle  which a gret honour
It is  to be a flaterynge lymytour
And of many another manere cryme
Which nedeth nat rehercen  for this tyme
And his office  I schal hym telle ywys
 Oure hoost answerde  pees namoore of this
And after this  he seyde vnto the frere
Tel forth youre tale  leeue maister deere
WHilom  ther was dwellynge in my contree
An Erchedekne  a man of hy degree
That boldely  dide execucion
In punysshynge of ffornicacion
Of wicchecraft and eek of Bawderye
Of diffamacion  and auoutrye
Of chirche Reues  and of testamentz
Of contractes  and eek of lakke of sacramentz
Of vsure  and of Symonye also
But certes  lecchours  dide he grettest wo
They sholde synge n if that they were hent
And smale tyth eres were foule yschent
If any person  wold vpon hem pleyne
Ther myghte asterte hym no pecunial peyne
ffor smale tithes and for smal offryng
He made the peple ful pitusly to syng
ffor er the bysschop caght hem with hys hooc
They were in the erchdeknys book
And thanne had he thurgh hys Iurisdiccion
Power  to do on hem correccion
He hadde a Somnour  redy to his hond  
A slyer boy  nas noon in Engelond
ffor subtilly  he hadde his espiaille
That taughte hym  wher hym myghte auaille
He koude spare  of lecchours  oon or two
To techen hym  to foure and twenty mo
ffor theigh this Somnour  wood were as an hare
To telle his harlotrye  I wol nat spare
  
ffor we been  out of his correccion
They han of vs  no Iurisdiccion
Ne neuere shullen  terme of hir lyues
 Peter  so been the wommen of the styves
Quod this Somnour  yput out of my cure
 Pees with myschaunce  and with mysauenture
Thus seyde oure hoost  and lat hym telle his tale
Now telleth forth  thogh þat the Somnour gale
Ne spareth nat myn owene mayster deere
 This false theef this Somnour  quod the frere
Hadde alwey  baudes redy to his hond
As any hauk to lure in Engelond
That tolde hym  al the secree þat they knewe
ffor hire aqueyntance  was nat come of newe
They weren  hise Approwours pryuely
He took hym self  a greet profit ther by
His maister knew nat alwey  what he wan
Withouten mandement a lewed man
He koude somne  on peyne of cristes curs
And they were glade  for to fille his purs
And make hym  grete festes atte nale
And right as Iudas  hadde purses smale
And was a theef right swich a theef was he
His maister  hadde but half his duetee
He was  if I shal yeuen hym his laude
A theef  and eek a somnour  and a baude
He hadde eek wenches  at his retenue
That wheither þat sir Robert  or sire hewe
Or Iakke  or Rauf or who so that it were
That lay by hem  they tolde it in his ere
Thus was the wenche and he  of oon assent
And he wolde fecche  a feyned mandement
And somne hem to Chapitre  bothe two  
And pile the man  and lete the wenche go
 Thanne wolde he seye  freend I shal for thy sake
Do stryke hire  out of oure lettres blake
  
Thee thar namore  as in this cas trauaille
I am thy freend  ther I thee may auaille
Certeyn  he knew of bryberyes mo
Than possible is  to telle in yeres two
ffor in this world  nys dogge for the bowe
That kan an hurt deer  from an hool knowe
Bet than this Somnour  knewe a sly lecchour
Or an Auouter  or a paramour
And for that was  the fruyt of al his rente
Therfore on it he sette al his entente
 And so bifel  that ones on a day
This Somnour  euere waityng on his pray
ffor to somne an old wydewe  a Ribibe
ffeynynge a cause  for he wolde brybe
Happed  that he say  bifore hym ryde
A gay yeman  vnder a fforest syde
A bowe he bar  and arwes brighte and kene
He hadde vpon  a courtepy of grene
An hat vpon his heed  with frenges blake
 Sire quod this Somnour  hayl  and wel atake
 Wel come quod he  and euery good felawe
Where ridestow  vnder this grene shawe
Seyde this yeman  wiltow fer to day
 This Somnour hym answerde  and seyde nay
Here faste by quod he  is myn entente
To ryden  for to reysen vp a rente
That longeth  to my lordes duetee
 Artow thanne a Bailly  ye quod he
He dorste nat for verray filthe and shame
Seye þat he was a Somnour  for the name
 Depardieux quod this yeman  deere brother
Thow art a bailly  and I am another

Of thyn aqueyntance  I wolde praye thee
And eek of bretherhede  if þat yow leste

If that thee happed to come in oure shire  
Al shal be thyn  right as thow wolt desire
 Graunt mercy quod this Somnour  by my feith
Euerich in ootheres hond  his trouthe leyth
ffor to be sworn bretheren  til they deye
In daliaunce  they ryden forth and pleye

As ful of venym  been thise waryangles
And euere enqueryng vpon euery thyng
Brother quod he  where is now youre dwellyng
Another day  if þat I sholde yow seche
This yeman hym answerde  in softe speche
 Brother quod he  fer in the North contree

That of myn hous  ne shaltow neuere mysse
 Now brother quod this Somnour I yow preye
Teche me  whil þat we ryden by the weye
Syn þat ye been a Baillyf  as am I

In myn office  how I may moost wynne
And spareth nat for conscience ne synne
But as my brother  tel me how do ye
 Now by my trouthe  brother deere  seyde he
As I shal tellen thee  a feithful tale
My wages been  ful streyte  and ful smale
My lord is hard to me  and daungerous
And myn office  is ful laborous
And therfore  by extorcions I lyue
ffor sothe I take  al that men wol me yeue
Algate  by sleighte  or by violence
ffro yeer to yeer  I wynne al my dispence
I kan no bettre tellen  feithfully
 Now certes quod this Somnour  so fare I

But it be to heuy  or to hoot
  
What I may gete  in conseil priuely
No manere conscience  of that haue I
Nere myn extorcion  I myghte nat lyuen
Ne of swiche Iapes  wol I nat be shryuen
Stomak ne Conscience  ne knowe I noon  
I sherewe  thise Shryftesfadres euerychon
Wel be we met by god  and by Seint Iame
But leeue brother  tel me thanne thy name
Quod this Somnour  in this mene whyle

And here I ryde  aboute my purchasyng
To wite  wher men wol yeue me any thyng
My purchas  is theffect of al my rente
Looke how thow rydest for the same entente
To wynne good  thow rekkest neuere how
Right so fare I  for ryde wold I now
Vnto the worldes ende  for a preye
 A quod this Somnour  benedicite what sey ye

Ye han a mannes shape  as wel as I
Han ye a figure thanne  determynat
In helle ther ye been  in youre estat
 Nay certeynly quod he  ther haue we noon
But whan vs liketh  we kan take vs oon
Or ellis make yow seme  we ben shape
Som tyme  lyk a man  or lyk an Ape
Or lyk an Aungel  kan I ryde or go
It is no wonder thyng theigh it be so
A lousy Iogelour  kan deceyue thee
And pardee yet kan I  moore craft than he
 Whi quod this Somnour  ryde ye thanne or goon
In sondry shape  and nat alwey in oon

As moost able is  oure preyes for to take
  
 What maketh yow  to han al this labour
 fful many a cause  leue sire Somnour
Seyde this feend  but alle thyng hath tyme
The day is short and it is passed pryme
And yet ne wan I no thyng in this day
I wol entende  to wynnyng if I may
And nat entende  oure wittes to declare
ffor brother myn  thy wit is al to bare
To vnderstonde  althogh I tolde hem thee  
But for thow axest why labouren we

And meenes  to doon his comandementz
Whan that hym list vp on his creatures
In diuers art and in diuerse figures
Withouten hym  we han no myght certayn
If that hym lyst to stonde ther agayn
And som tyme  at oure preyere  han we leue
Oonly the body  and nat the soule greue
Witnesse on Iob  whom þat we diden wo
And som tyme  han we myght of bothe two
This is to seyn  of soule and body eke
And som tyme  be we suffred for to seke
Vpon a man  and do his soule vnreste
And nat his body  and al is for the beste
Whan he withstandeth  oure temptacion
It is  a cause  of his sauacion
Al be it that it was  nat oure entente
He sholde be sauf but þat we wolde hym hente
And som tyme  be we seruant vnto man
As to the Erchebisshope  Seint Dunstan
And to the Apostles  seruant eek was I
 Yet tel me  quod the Somnour feithfully
Make ye yow newe bodyes  thus alway
Of Elementz  the feend answerde nay
Som tyme we feyne  and som tyme we aryse
With dede bodyes  in ful sondry wyse
  
And speke as renably  and faire and wel

And right at the entryng of the townes ende

And with that word  this foule feend hym hente
Body and soule  he with the deuel wente
Wher as that Somnours  han hir heritage  
And god  that made after his ymage
Mankynde  saue  and gyde vs alle and some
And leue thise Somnours  goode men to bicome
 Lordynges I koude han told yow  quod the frere
Hadde I had leyser  for this Somnour heere
After the text  of crist Poul and Iohn
And of oure othere doctours  many oon
Swich peynes  that youre hertes myghte agryse
Al be it so  no tonge may it deuyse
Thogh that I myghte  a thousand wynter telle
The peynes  of thilke cursed hous of helle
  
But for to kepe vs  fro that cursed place
Waketh  and preyeth Ihesu for his grace
So kepe vs  fro the temptour Sathanas
Herketh this word  beth war as in this cas
The leon sit in his awayt alway
To sle the Innocent if that he may
Disposeth ay youre hertes  to withstonde
The feend  that yow wolde maken thral and bonde
He may nat tempte yow  ouer youre myght
ffor crist wol be youre champion and knyght
And prayeth  that this Somnours hem repente
Of hir mysdedes  er that the feend hem hente  
This Somnour in his Stiropes  hye he stood
Vpon this frere  his herte was so wood
That lyk an Aspen lief  he quook for Ire
 Lordynges quod he  but o thyng I desire
I yow biseke  that of youre curteisye
Syn ye han herd  this false frere lye
As suffreth me  I may my tale telle
This frere bosteth  that he knoweth helle
And god it woot that it is litel wonder
ffreres and feendes  been but lyte a sonder
ffor pardee  ye han ofte tyme herd telle  
How that a frere  rauysshed was to helle
In Spirit ones  by avisioun
And as an Aungel  ladde hym vp and down
To shewen hym  the peynes þat ther were
In al the place  say he nat a frere
Of oother folk  he say ynowe in wo
Vnto this Angel  spak the frere tho
 Now Sire quod he  han freres swich a grace
That noon of hem  shal come to this place
 Yis quod this Aungel  many a Milioun
And vnto Sathanas  he ladde hym doun
And now hath Sathanas  seith he a tayl
Brodder  than of a Carryk is the sayl
Hold vp thy tayl  thow Sathanas quod he
Shewe forth thyn ers  and lat the frere se
Where is thee nest of freres  in this place
And er þat  half a furlong wey of space
  
Right so as bees  out swarmen from an hyue
Out of the deueles ers  ther gonne dryue
Twenty thousand freres  on a route
And thurghout helle  swarmeden aboute
And comen again  as faste as they may gon
And in his ers  they crepten euerychon
He clapte his tayl agayn  and lay ful stille
This frere  whan he looked hadde his fille
Vpon the tormentz  of this sory place
His spirit god restored of his grace
Vnto his body agayn  and he awook
But nathelees  for fere yet he quook
So was the deueles ers  ay in his mynde
That is his heritage  of verray kynde
God saue yow alle  saue this cursed frere
My prologe  wol I ende  in this manere  
LOrdynges  ther is in Yorkshire  as I gesse
A Merssh contree  called Holdernesse
In which  ther wente a lymytour aboute
To preche  and eek to begge  it is no doubte
And so bifel  that on a day this frere
Hadde preched at a chirche  in his manere
And specially  abouen euery thyng
Excyted he the peple  in his prechyng
To trentals  and to yeue for goddes sake
Wherwith men myghte  holy houses make
Ther as dyuyne seruice  is honoured
Nat ther  as it is wasted and deuoured
Ne ther  it nedeth nat to be yeue
As to possessioners  that mowen lyue
Thanked be god  in wele and habundance
Trentals seyde he  deliuereth from penaunce
Hir freendes soules  as wel olde as yonge
Ye  whan that they  been hastily ysonge
Nat for to holde a preest Ioly and gay
He syngeth nat but o masse in a day
Deliuereth out quod he  anon the soules
fful hard it is  with flesshhook or with oules
To been yclawed  or to brenne  or bake
Now spede yow hastily  for cristes sake
And whan this frere  hadde seyd al his entente
With qui cum patre  forth his wey he wente
Whan folk in chirche  hadde yeue hym  what hem leste
He wente his wey  no lenger wolde he reste
  
With scryppe and typped staf  ytukked hye
In euery hous  he gan to poure and prye
And beggeth Mele  and chese  or ellis corn
His felawe hadde a staf  typped with horn
A peyre of tables  al of yuory
And a poyntel  polysshed fetisly
And wroot the names  alwey as he stood
Of alle folk  that yaf hem any good
Ascaunces  that he wolde for hem preye  
Yif vs a busshel whete  Malt or Reye
A goddes kechyl  or a trype of cheese
Or ellis what yow lyst we may nat chese
A goddes half peny  or a masse peny
Or yif vs of youre brawn  if ye haue eny
A dagon of youre Blanket leeue dame
Oure suster deere  lo heere I write youre name
Bacon  or boef  or swich thyng as ye fynde
A sturdy harlot wente ay hem bihynde
That was hir hostes man  and baar a sak
And what men yaf hem  leyde it on his bak
And whan that he was out at dore anon
He planed awey  the names euerichon
That he biforn  hadde writen in his tables
He serued hem  with nyfles and with fables
 Nay ther thow lixt thow Somnour quod the frere
 Pees quod oure hoost for cristes moder deere
Tel forth thy tale  and spare it nat at al
 So thryue I quod this Somnour  so I shal
So longe he wente  hous by hous  til he
Cam til an hous  ther he was wont to be
Refresshed moore  than in an hundred placis
Syk lay the goode man  whos the place is
Bedrede vpon a couche  lowe he lay

Seyde this frere  curteisly and softe
Thomas quod he  god yelde yow ful ofte
  
Haue I vpon this bench  faren ful wel
Heere haue I eten  many a murye mel
And fro the bench  he droof awey the cat
And leyde adoun  his potente and his hat
And eek his scrippe  and sette hym softe adown
His felawe  was go walked in to town
fforth with his knaue  into that hostelrye
Wher as he shoope hym  thilke nyght to lye
 O deere maister  quod this syke man
How han ye fare  sith that March bigan

And for oure othere freendes  god hem blesse

And seyd a sermon  after my symple wit
Nat al  after the text of holy writ

And therfore  wol I teche yow al the glose

Ther haue I taught hem  to be charitable
And spende hir good  ther it is resonable
And ther I say oure dame  a where is she

 Ey maister  wel come be ye  by Seint Iohn

To grope tendrely  a conscience

And studie  in Petres wordes  and in Poules

To yelden Ihesu crist  his propre rente
To sprede his word  is set al myn entente
 Now by youre leeue  o deere sire quod she

Thogh that he haue  al that he kan desire
Thogh I hym wrye a nyght and make hym warm
And on hym leye  my leg outher myn arm
He groneth lyk oure boor  lyth in oure Sty
Oother disport right noon of hym haue I

 O Thomas Ie vous dy  Thomas  Thomas

And therof  wol I speke  a word  or two
 Now maister quod the wyf  er þat I go

 Now dame quod he  now Ie vous dy sanz doute

And of youre softe breed  nat but a shyuere
And after that a rosted pigges heed
But þat I nolde  no beest for me were deed
Thanne hadde I with yow  homly suffisaunce

My Spirit hath his fostryng in the bible
The body is ay  so redy and penyble
To wake  that my stomak is destroyed
I pray yow dame  ye be nat anoyed
Thogh I so freendly  yow my conseil shewe
By god  I wolde nat telle it but a fewe
 Now sire quod she  but o word  er I go

Soone after that ye wente  out of this town

After his deeth  I say hym born to blisse
In myn avision  so god me wisse
So dide oure Sexteyn  and oure ffermerer
That han been trewe freres fifty yeer
They may now  god be thanked  of his lone
Maken hir Iubilee  and walke allone
And vp I roos  and al oure Couent eke
With many a teere  triklyng on my cheke
Withouten noyse  or clateryng of belles  
Te Deum was oure song and no thyng elles
Saue that to crist  I seyde an orison
Thankynge hym  of his reuelacion
ffor sire and dame  trusteth me right wel
Oure orisons  been wel moore effectuel
And moore we seen  of cristes secree thynges
Than burell folk al thogh þat they were kynges
We lyue in pouerte  and in abstinence
And burell folk in richesse and dispence
Of mete and drynke  and in hir foul delit
We han this worldes lust al in despit
Lazar and Diues  lyueden diuersly
And diuerse gerdon  hadde they therby
Who so wol praye  he moot faste and be clene
And fatte his soule  and make his body lene
  
We fare as seith thapostle  clooth and foode
Suffiseth vs  thogh they be nat ful goode
The clennesse  and the fastyng of vs freres
Maketh  that crist accepteth oure prayeres
 Lo Moyses  fourty dayes  and fourty nyght
ffasted  er that the heighe god of myght
Spak with hym  in the mountayne of Synay
With empty wombe  fastynge many a day
Receyued he the lawe  that was writen
With goddes fynger  and Elye wel ye witen
In Mount Oreb  er he hadde any speche
With hye god  that is oure lyues leche
He fasted longe  and was in contemplaunce
Aaron  that hadde the temple in gouernaunce
And eek  that othere preestes euerichon
Into the temple  whan they sholde gon
To preye for the peple  and do seruyse
They nolden drynken  in no maner wyse
No drynke  which that myghte hem dronke make
But there in abstinence  preye and wake
Lest that they deyden  tak hede what I seye
But they be sobre  that for the peple preye
War that I seye namoore  for it suffiseth
Oure lord Ihesu  as holy writ deuyseth
Yaf vs ensample  of fastyng and prayeres  
Ther fore  we mendynantz  we sely freres
Been wedded  to pouerte and continence
To charitee  humblesse and abstinence
To persecucion  for rightwisnesse
To wepyng misericorde and clennesse
And therfore may ye se  that oure prayeres
I speke of vs  we mendinantz  we freres
Be to the hye god  moore acceptable
Than youres  with youre festes at the table
ffro Paradys first if I shal nat lye
Was man out chaced  for his glotonye
  
And chaast was man  in Paradys certeyn
 But herkne Thomas  what I shal seyn
I ne haue no text of it as I suppose
But I shal fynde it in a maner glose
That specially  oure swete lord Ihesus
Spak this by freres  whan he seyde thus
Blessed be they  that poure in Spirit been
And so forth  in the gospel  may ye seen
Wher it be likker  oure profession
Or hire  that swymmen in possession
ffy on hir pompe  and hir glotonye
And for hir lewednesse  I hem diffye
Me thynketh  they been lyk Iouynyan

Al vynolent as Botel in the Spence
Hir preyere is  of ful greet reuerence
Whan they for soules  seye the psalm of Dauit
Lo buf they seye  cor meum eructauit
Who folweth cristes gospel  and his foore
But we that humble been  and chaast and poore
Werkers of goddes word  nat Auditours
Ther fore  right as an hauk  vp at a sours
Vp spryngeth into theyr  right so prayeres
Of charitable  and chaste bisy freres
Maken hir sours  to goddes erys two
Thomas  Thomas  so mote I ryde or go
And by that lord  that clepid is Seint yue
Nere thow oure brother  sholdestow nat thryue
 oure chapitre  praye we day and nyght
To crist that he thee sende  heele and myght
Thy body  for to welden hastily

As help me crist as I in fewe yeres
Haue spended  vpon diuerse manere freres

Certeyn  my good haue I almoost biset
  
ffarwel my gold  for it is al ago
 The frere answerde  o Thomas doostow so
What nedeth yow  diuerse freres seche
What nedeth hym  that hath a parfit leche
To sechen  othere leches in the town
Youre inconstance  is youre confusioun
Holde ye thanne me  or ellis oure Couent
To preye for yow  been insufficient
Thomas  that Iape  nys nat worth a myte
Youre maladye  is for we han to lyte
A yif that Couent half a quarter otes
A yif that Couent xxiiij grotes
A yif that frere a peny  and lat hym go
Nay nay Thomas  it may no thyng be so
What is a ferthyng worth  parted in twelue
Lo  ech thyng that is oned in hym selue
Is moore strong than whan it is toscatered
Thomas  of me  thow shalt nat been yflatered
Thow woldest han oure labour  al for noght
The hye god  that al this world hath wroght
Seith  that the werkman  worthy is his hire
Thomas  noght of youre tresor I desire
As for my self  but that al oure Couent
To praye for yow  is ay so diligent
And for to buylden  cristes owene chirche
Thomas  if ye wol lernen for to wirche
Of buyldyng vp of chirches  may ye fynde
If it be good  in Thomas lyf of Inde
Ye lye heere ful of Anger and of Ire
With which  the deuel set youre herte afire
And chiden heere  the sely Innocent
Youre wyf that is so meke and pacient
And therfore Thomas  trowe me if thee leste  
Ne stryue nat with thy wyf as for thy beste
And bere this word awey  now by thy feith
Touchynge swich thyng lo what the wise man seith
  
 WithInne thyn hous  ne be thow no leon
To thy subgitz  do noon oppression
Ne make thyne aqueyntances  nat for to flee
And Thomas  yet eft soones I charge thee
Be war from hire  that in thy bosom slepeth
War fro the serpent that so sleighly crepeth
Vnder the gras  and styngeth subtilly
Be war my sone  and herkne paciently
That twenty thousand men  han lost hir lyues
ffor stryuyng with hir lemmans and hir wyues
Now sith ye han  so holy meke a wyf
What nedeth yow Thomas  to maken stryf
Their nys ywis  no serpent so cruel
Whan man tret on his tayl  ne half so fel
As womman is  whan she hath caught an Ire
Vengeance is thanne  al that they desire
Ire is a synne  oon of the grete of seuene
Abhomynable  vnto the god of heuene
And to hym self  it is destruccion
This euery lewed viker  or parson
Kan seye  how Ire engendreth homicide
Ire is in sooth  executour of pryde
I koude of Ire  seye so muche sorwe
My tale  sholde laste til to morwe
And therfore praye I god  bothe day and nyght
An Irous man  god sende hym litel myght
It is greet harm  and certes greet pitee
To sette an Irous man in heigh degree
WHilom  ther was an Irous potestat
As seith Senek that durynge his estat
Vpon a day  out ryden knyghtes two
And as ffortune wolde  that it were so
That oon of hem cam hom  that oother noght
Anon the knyght bifore the Iuge is broght
That seyde thus  thow hast thy felawe slayn
ffor which  I deme thee to the deeth certayn
  
d to another knyght comanded he
Go leed hym to the deeth  I charge thee
And happed  as they wente by the weye
Toward the place  ther he sholde deye
The knyght cam  which men wenden had be deed
Thanne thoghten they  it were the beste reed
To lede hem bothe  to the Iuge agayn
They seyden  lord  the knyght ne hath nat slayn
His felawe  heere he stant hool alyue
 Ye shul be deed quod he  so moot I thryue
This is to seyn  bothe oon and two and thre
And to the firste knyght right thus spak he
 I dampned thee  thou most algate be deed
And thow also  most nedes lese thyn heed
ffor thow art cause  why thy felawe deyth
And to the thridde knyght right thus he seith
Thow hast nat doon  that I comanded thee
And thus he dide  do sleen hem alle thre
 Irous Cambyses  was eek dronkelewe
And ay delited hym  to been a shrewe
And so bifel  a lord of his meynee
That louede  vertuous moralitee
Seyde on a day  bitwix hem two right thus
 A lord is 2lost if he be vicius2
And dronkenesse  is eek a foul record
Of any man  and namely in a lord
Ther is ful many an eighe  and many an ere
Awaityng on a lord  he noot nat where
ffor goddes loue  drynk moore attemprely
Wyn maketh man  to lesen wrecchedly
His mynde  and eek his lymes euerychon
 The reuers shaltow se  quod he anon
And preue it by thyn owene experience
That wyn ne dooth to folk no swich offence
Ther is no wyn  bireueth me my myght
Of hond ne foot ne of myne eyen sight
  
And for despit he drank ful muchel moore
An hundred part than he hadde doon bifore
And right anon  this Irous cursed wrecche
bifore hym Leet this knyghtes sone  fecche
Comandynge hym  he sholde bifore hym stonde  
And sodeynly  he took his bowe in honde
And vp the streng he pulled to his ere
And with an arwe  he slow the child right there
Now  wheither haue I  a siker hand or noon
Quod he  is al my myght and mynde agoon
Hath wyn byreued me  myn eye sight
 What sholde I telle  thanswere of the knyght
His sone was slayn  ther is namoore to seye
Beth war ther fore  with lordes how ye pleye
Syngeth Placebo  and I shal if I kan
But if it be  vnto a poure man
To a poure man  men sholde his vices telle
But nat to a lord  thogh he sholde go to helle
 Lo Irous Syrus  thilke Percien
How he destroyed  the ryuer of Gysen
ffor that an hors of his  was dreynt therInne
Whan that he wente  Babiloyne to wynne
He made  that the Ryuer was so smal
That wommen  myghte wade it ouer al
Lo what seyde he  that so wel teche kan
Ne be no felawe  to an Irous man
Ne with no wood man  walke by the weye
Lest thee repente  I wol no ferther seye
 Now Thomas leeue brother  lef thyn Ire
Thow shalt me fynde  as Iust as is a Squyre
Hoold nat the deueles knyf  ay at thyn herte
Thyn angre dooth thee  al to soore smerte
But shewe to me  al thy confession
 Nay quod the sike man  by Seint Symon
I haue be shryuen this day  at my Curat
I haue hym toold  hoolly al myn estat
  
Nedeth namoore to speke of it seith he
But if me list of myn humylitee
 Yif me thanne of thy gold  to make oure cloystre
Quod he  for many a Muscle  and many an Oystre
Whan othere men  han been ful wel at eyse
Hath been oure foode  oure Cloystre for to reyse
And yet god woot vnnethe the fundement
Parfourned is  ne of oure pauement

By god  we owen fourty pound for stones
Now help Thomas  for hym þat harwed helle
Or ellis mote we  oure bookes selle
And if yow lakke  oure predicacion
Thanne gooth the world  al to destruccion
ffor who so  fro this world  wolde vs bireue
So god me saue  Thomas by youre leue
He wolde bireue  out of the world the sonne
ffor who kan teche  and werchen as we konne
And that is nat of litel tyme quod he
But sith Elie was  or Elize
Han freres been  that fynde I of record
In charitee  thonked be oure lord
Now Thomas  help for Seinte charitee
And down anon  he set hym on his knee
 This sike man  weex wel neigh wood for Ire

With his false dissimulacion
Swich thyng as is in my possession
Quod he  that may I yeue and noon oother
Ye sey me thus  how that I am youre brother
 Ye certes quod the frere  trusteth wel

This shaltow swere  on thy profession
Withouten fraude  or cauelacion

Lo here my feith  in me  shal be no lak
 Now thanne put thyn hand  down by my bak
Seyde this man  and grope wel bihynde
Bynethe my buttok there shaltow fynde
A thyng that I haue hyd in pryuetee
 A thoghte this frere  that shal go with me
And down his hand  he launcheth to the clifte  
In hope  for to fynde there a yifte
And whan this sike man  felte this frere
Aboute his tuwel  grope there and heere
Amydde his hand  he leet the frere a fart
Ther is no capul  drawyng in a Cart
That myghte han late a fart of swich a sown
 The frere vp stirte  as dooth a wood leoun
A false cherl quod he  for goddes bones
This hastow for despit doon for the nones
Thow shalt abye this fart if þat I may
His meynee  which that herden this affray
Cam lepyng In  and chaced out the frere
And forth he gooth  with a ful angry cheere
And fette his felawe  ther as lay his stoor
He looked  as he were a wilde boor
He grynt with his teeth  so was he wrooth
A sturdy paas  doun to the court he gooth
Wher as ther woned  a man of greet honour
To whom  that he was alwey confessour
This worthy man  was lord of that village
This frere cam  as he were in a rage
Where as this lord  sat etyng at his boord
Vnnethe  myghte the frere speke a woord
  
Til atte laste  he seyde  god yow see
 This lord gan looke  and seyde benedicitee
What frere Iohn  what manere world is this

Sit doun anon  and tel me what youre grief is
And it shal been amended  if I may
 I haue quod he  had a despit to day
God yelde yow  adown in youre village
That in this world  ther nys so poure a page
That he nolde haue  abhomynacioun
Of that I haue receyued in youre toun
And yet ne greueth me  no thyng so soore
As that this olde cherl  with lokkes hoore
Blasphemed hath  oure hooly Couent eke
 Now maister quod this lord  I yow biseke
No maister sire quod he  but seruytour  
Thogh I haue had in scole  that honour
God liketh nat that Raby men vs calle
Neither in Market nyn youre large halle
 No force quod he  but tel me al youre grief
 Sire quod this frere  an odious meschief

And so par consequens  to ech degree
Of holy chirche  god amende it soone
 Sire quod the lord  ye woot what is to doone
Distempre yow noght ye be my confessour

Tel me youre grief and he anon hym tolde
As ye han herd biforn  ye woot wel what

 Ey goddes moder quod she  blisful mayde
Is ther aught ellis  tel me feithfully
 Ma dame quod he  how thynketh yow ther by
  
 How þat me thynketh quod she  so god me spede

What sholde I seye  god lat hym neuere thee
His sike heed  is ful of vanytee
I holde hym  in a manere frenesye
 Madame quod he  by god I shal nat lye
But I  on oother wise  may be wreke
I shal diffame hym  ouer al wher I speke
The false blasphemour  that charged me
To parte  that wol nat departed be
To euery man yliche  with meschaunce
 The lord sat stille  as he were in a traunce
And in his herte  he rolled vp and down
How hadde this cherl  ymaginacioun
To shewe swich a probleme  to the frere
Neuere erst er now  herde I swich matere
I trowe the deuel  putte it in his mynde
In Arsmetrik shal ther no man fynde
Bifore this day  of swich a question
Who sholde  make a demonstracion
That euery man sholde han  ylike his part  
As of a soun  or sauour  of a fart
O nyce prowde cherl  I shrewe his face
 Lo sires quod the lord  with harde grace
Who euere herde  of swich a thyng er now
To euery man ylike  tel me how
It is an inpossible  it may nat be
Ey nyce cherl  god lat hym neuere thee
The rumblyng of a fart and euery soun
Nys but of Eyr  reuerberacioun
And there it wasteth  lite and lite awey
Ther nys no man  kan deme by my fey
If that it were  departed equally
What lo my cherl  lo yet how shrewedly
Vnto my confessour  to day he spak
I holde hym certeynly  demonyak
  
Now ete youre mete  and lat the cherl go pleye
Lat hym go hange hym self a deuel weye
 Now stood  the lordes Squyer at the boord

Of alle thyng of which I haue yow sayd

To yow sire frere  so ye be nat wrooth
How that this fart sholde euene ydeled be
Among youre Couent if it liked me
 Tel quod the lord  and thow shalt haue anon
A gowne clooth  by god and by Seint Iohn
 My lord quod he  whan that the weder is fair
Withouten wynd  or perturbynge of Air
Lat brynge a Cartwheel  heere into this halle
But looke that it haue  his spokes alle
Twelf spokes  hath a Cartwheel comunly
And brynge me thanne twelf freres  woot ye why
For thrittene  is a Couent  as I gesse
Youre confessour heere  for his worthynesse
Shal parfourne vp  the nombre of this Couent
Thanne shal they knele adown  by oon assent
And to euery spokes ende  in this manere
fful sadly  leye his nose  shal a frere
Youre noble Confessour  ther god hym saue  
Shal holde his nose  vp right vnder the Naue
Thanne shal this cherl  with baly  stif and toght
As any tabour  hider been ybroght
And sette hym on the wheel  right of this Cart
Vp on the Naue  and make hym lete a fart
And ye shal seen  on peril of my lyf
By proue  which that is demonstratyf
  
That equally  the soun of it wol wende
And eek the stynk vnto the spokes ende
Saue  that this worthy man  youre Confessour
By cause  he is a man of greet honour
Shal han the firste fruyt as reson is
The noble vsage of freres  yet is this
The worthy men of hem  shul first be serued
And certeynly  he hath it wel disserued
He hath to day  taught vs so muchel good
With prechyng in the pulput ther he stood
That I may vouche sauf  I seye for me
He hadde the firste smel  of fartes thre
And so wolde  al his Couent hardily
He bereth hym  so faire and holily
 The lord  the lady  ech man  saue the frere
Seyden  that Iankyn spak in this matere
As wel  as Euclyde  or Protholomee
Touchynge the cherl  they seyde subtiltee
And hy wit made hym speke  as he spak
He nys no fool  ne no demonyak
And Iankyn hath ywonne  a newe gowne
My tale is doon  we been almoost at towne  
WHan ended was my tale  of Melibee  
And of Prudence  and hire benygnitee
Oure hoost seyde  as I am feithful man
And by  that precious corpus Madrian
I hadde leuere  than a barel Ale
That goode lief my wyf  hadde herd this tale
She nys no thyng of swich pacience
As was  this Melibeus wyf Prudence
By goddes bones  whan I bete my knaues
She bryngeth me  the grete clobbed staues
And crieth  slee the dogges euerichon
And breke hem  bothe bak and euery bon
And if þat  any neighebore  of myne
Wol nat in chirche  to my wyf enclyne
Or be so hardy  to hire to trespace
Whan she cometh  she raumpeth in my face
And crieth  false coward wrek thy wyf
By corpus bones  I wol haue thy knyf
And thow shalt haue my distaf and go spynne
ffro day to nyght right thus she wol bigynne
Allas she seith  þat euere þat I was shape
To wedden a Milksope  or a coward Ape
That wol been ouerlad  of euery wight
Thow darst nat stonden  by thy wyues right
This is my lif but if þat I wol fighte
And out at dore  anoon I moot me dighte
Or ellis I am but lost but if þat I
Be lyk a wilde leon  fool hardy
I woot wel  she wol do me sle som day
Som neighebore  and thanne go my way
ffor I am perilous  with knyf in honde
Al be it that I dar nat hire withstonde
  
ffor she is big in armes  by my feith
That shal he fynde  þat hire mysdooth  or seith
But lat vs passe awey  fro this matere
 My lord the Monk quod he  be myrie of cheere

Lo  Rouchestre  stant heer fasteby
Ride forth myn owene lord  brek nat oure game
But by my trouthe  I knowe nat youre name
Wher shal I calle yow  my lord Dann Iohn
Or dann Thomas  or ellis Dann Albon
Of what hous be ye  by youre fader kyn
I vow to god  thow hast a ful fair skyn
It is a gentil pasture  ther thow goost
Thow art nat lyk a penannt or a goost
Vpon my feith  thow art som Officer
Som worthy Sexteyn  or som Celerer
ffor by my fader soule  as to my doom
Thow art a maister  whan thou art at hom
No poure Cloistrer  ne no novys
But a gouernour  wily and wys
And ther with al  of brawnes and of bones
A wel farynge persone  for the nones
I prey god  yeue hym confusion
That first thee broghte  vnto Religion
Thow woldest han been a tredefoul aright
Haddestow  as greet a leue as thow hast myght
To perfourne  al thy lust in engendrure
Thow haddest bigeten  ful many a creature
Allas  why werestow so wyd a cope
God yeue me sorwe  but and I were a Pope
Nat oonly thow  but euery myghty man
Thogh he were shore  ful hye vp on his pan
Sholde haue a wyf for al the world is lorn
Religion  hath take vp al the corn
Of tredyng and we borel men been shrympes
Of feble trees  ther comen wrecched ympes
  
This maketh  þat oure heires beth so sklendre
And feble  þat they may nat wel engendre
This maketh  þat oure wyues wole assaye
Religious folk  for ye mowe bettre paye
Of Venus paiementz  than may we
God woot no lussheburgh payen ye
But be nat wrooth my Lord  thogh þat I pleye
fful ofte in game  a sooth I haue herd seye
 This worthy Monk  took al in pacience  
And seyde  I wol doon al my diligence
As fer  as sowneth in to honestee
To telle yow a tale  or two  or three
And if yow list to herkne hiderward
I wol yow seyn  the lyf of Seint Edward
Or ellis first tragedies wol I telle
Of whiche  I haue an hundred in my Celle
Tragedie is to seyn  a certeyn storie
As olde bokes  maken vs memorie
Of hym  þat stood in greet prosperitee
And is yfallen  out of heigh degree
In to myserie  and endeth wrecchedly
And they been  versified comunly
Of vj feet whiche men clepyn Exametron
In prose eek been endited many oon
And eek in metre  in many a sondry wise
Lo this declaryng oghte ynogh suffise
 Now herkneth  if yow liketh for to heere
But first I yow biseke  in this matere
Though I by ordre  telle nat thise thynges
Be it of Popes  Emperours  or Kynges
After hir ages  as men writen fynde
But telle hem  som bifore  and som bihynde
As it now cometh  vnto my remembrance
Haueth me excused  of myn ignorance

I Wol biwaille  in manere of Tragedie
The harm of hem  that stoode in heigh degree
And fillen so  that ther nas no remedie
To brynge hem  out of hire Aduersitee
ffor certeyn  whan þat ffortune list to flee
Ther may no man  the cours of hire withholde
Lat no man triste  on blynd prosperitee
Beth war  by thise ensamples trewe and olde
AT lucifer  thogh he an Aungel were  
And nat a man  at hym I wol bigynne
ffor thogh ffortune  may noon Aungel dere
ffrom heigh degree  yet fil he for his synne
Doun in to Helle  where as he yet is Inne
O Lucifer  brightest of Aungels alle
Now artow Sathanas  that mayst nat twynne
Out of Miserie  in which þat thou art falle
Lo Adam in the feld of Damyssene
With godes owne fynger wrowt was he 
And nat bygeten of mannes sperme vnclene 
And welte al paradiis sauyng o tree 
Had neuer wordly man so hey degre 
As Adam til he for mysgouernance 
Was dryue owt of his hey prosperitee 
To labour and to helle and to meschance

LO Sampson  which that was anunciat
By the Aungel  longe er his natiuitee
And was  to god almyghty consecrat
And stood in noblesse  whil that he myghte see
Was neuere swich another  as was he
To speke of strengthe  and therwith hardynesse
But to hise wyues  tolde he his secree
Thurgh which  he slow hym self for wrecchednesse
 Sampson  this noble almyghty champion
Withouten wepne  saue hise hondes tweye
He slow  and al torente the leon
Toward his weddyng walkynge by the weye
His false wyf  koude hym so plese and preye
Til she his conseil knew  and she vntrewe
Vnto his foos  his conseil gan biwreye
And hym forsook and took another newe
 Thre hundred foxes  took Sampson for Ire
And alle hir tayles  he togydre bond
And sette the foxes tayles  alle on fire
ffor he on euery tayl  hadde knyt a brond
And they brende  alle the cornes in that Lond
And alle hire Olyueris  and Vynes eke
A thousand men  he slow with his hond
And hadde no wepne  but an Asses cheke
 Whan they were slayn  so thursted hym  þat he
Was wel ny lorn  for which he gan to preye
That god  wolde on his peyne  haue som pitee
And sende hym drynke  or ellis moste he deye
And of this Asses cheke  that was dreye
Out of a wang tooth  sprang anon a welle
Of which he drank ynogh  shortly to seye
Thus heelp hym god  as Iudicum kan telle
  
 By verray force  at Gazan  on a nyght  
Maugree Philistiens  of that Citee
The gates of the toun  he hath vp plight
And on his bak ycaried hem hath he
Hye on an hill  where as men myght hem se
O noble almyghty Sampson  leef and deere
Had thow nat toold  to wommen thy secree
In al this world  ne hadde been thy peere
 This Sampson  neuere Ciser drank ne wyn
Ne on his heed  cam Rasour noon ne shere
By precept of the Messager deuyn
ffor alle his strengthes  in his herys were
And fully xx wynter  yeer by yere
He hadde of Israel  the gouernance
But soone  shal he wepe many a teere
ffor wommen  shul hym bryngen to meschaunce
 Vnto his lemman Dalida  he tolde
That in his herys  al his strengthe lay
And falsly  to his fomen she hym solde
And slepynge in hir barm  vp on a day
She made to clippe  or shere his heer away
And made his fomen  al this craft espien
And whan þat they  hym fond in this array
They bounde hym faste  and putten out his eyen
 But er his heer  was clipped or yshaue
Ther was no bond  with which  men myghte hym bynde
But now is he  in prisone in a Caue
Where as they made hym  at the querne grynde
O noble Sampson  strengest of mankynde
O whilom  Iuge in glorie  and in richesse
Now  maystow wepen  with thyne eyen blynde
Sith thow fro wele  art falle in wrecchednesse
  
 The ende of this caytif was as I shal seye
His fomen  made a feste vpon a day
And made hym as hire fool  bifore hem pleye
And this was  in a temple of greet array
But atte laste  he made a foul affray
ffor he two pilers shook  and made hem falle
And doun fil temple and al  and there it lay
And slow hym self  and eek his fomen alle
 This is to seyn  the Prynces euerychon  
And eek thre thousand bodies  were ther slayn
With fallyng of the grete temple of stoon
Of Sampson  now wol I namoore sayn
Beth war by this ensample  old and playn
That no men  telle hir conseil  til hir wyues
Of swich thyng as they wolde han secree fayn
If þat it touche  hir lymes  or hir lyues
Of hercules  the souereyn conquerour
Syngen hise werkes  laude and heigh renoun
ffor in his tyme  of strengthe he was the flour
He slow  and rafte the skyn fro the leoun
He of Centauros  leyde the boost adown
He Arpies slow  the cruel briddes felle
The golden Apples  rafte of the dragoun
He drow out Cerberus  the hound of helle
 He slow the cruel tyrant Busirus
And made his hors  to frete hym flessh and bon
He slow the firy serpent venymus
Of Achilois two hornes  he brak oon
And he slow Cakus  in a Caue of stoon
He slow the geant Antheus the stronge
He slow the grisly boor  and that anon
And bar the heuene  on his nekke longe
  
 Was neuere wight sith þat this world bigan
That slew so manye monstres  as dide he
Thurghout this wide world  his name ran
What for his strengthe  and for his heigh bountee
And euery Reawme  wente he for to se
He was so strong þat no man myghte hym lette
At bothe the worldes endes  seith Trophee 
In stede of boundes  he a piler sette
 A lemman  hadde this noble champion
That highte Dianra  fressh as May
And as thise clerkes  maken mencion
She hath hym sent a sherte  fressh and gay
Allas this sherte  allas and weylaway
Enuenymed was  so subtilly with alle
That er þat he  hadde wered it half a day
It made his flessh  al from hise bones falle
 But natheles  somme clerkes hire excusen  
By oon þat highte Nessus  þat it maked
Be as be may  I wol hire noght accusen
But on his bak the sherte he wered al naked
Til þat his flessh  was for the venym blaked
And whan he say  noon oother remedie
In hote coles  he hath hym seluen raked
ffor with no venym  deigned hym to dye
 Thus starf  this worthy myghty Hercules
Lo who may truste on ffortune  any throwe
ffor hym þat folweth  al this world of prees
Er he be war  is ofte yleyd ful lowe
fful wys is he  þat kan hym seluen knowe
Beth war  for whan þat ffortune list to glose
Thanne waiteth she  hir man to ouerthrowe
By swich a wey  as he wolde leest suppose

The myghty trone  the precious tresor 
The glorious ceptre  and roial maiestee
That hadde  the kyng Nabugodonosor
With tonge  vnnethe  may discryued be
He twies  wan Ierusalem the Citee
The vessel of the temple  he with hym ladde
At Babiloigne  was his souereyn see
In which  his glorie  and his delit he hadde
 The faireste children  of the blood roial
Of Israel  he leet do gelde anon
And maked ech of hem  to been his thral
Amonges othere  Danyel was oon
That was  the wiseste child of euerychoon
ffor he the dremes  of the kyng expowned
Ther as in Chaldeye  clerk ne was ther noon
That wiste  to what fyn his dremes sowned
 This proude kyng leet make a Statue of gold
Sixty cubites long and Seuene in brede
To which ymage  he bothe yong and old
Comanded to loute  and haue in drede
Or in a fourneys  ful of flambes rede
He shal be brend  that wolde noght obeye
But neuere  wolde assente to that dede
Danyel  ne hise yonge felawes tweye
 This kyng of kynges  proud was and elat  
He wende  that god  þat sit in magestee
Ne myghte hym nat bireue  of his estat
But sodeynly  he loste his dignytee
And lyk a beest hym semed for to be
And eet hey as an Oxe  and lay ther oute
In reyn  with wilde beestes walked he
Til certeyn tyme  was ycome aboute
  
 And lyk an Egles fetheres  wax hise herys
Hise nayles  lyk a briddes clawes weere
Til god relessed hym  a certeyn yerys
And yaf hym wit and thanne with many a teere
He thanked god  and euere his lyf in feere
Was he to doon amys  or moore trespace
And til that tyme  he leyd was on his beere
He knew  that god  was ful of myght and grace
 His sone  which that highte Balthasar
That heeld the regne  after his fader day
He by his fader  koude noght be war
ffor proud he was  of herte and of array
And eek an ydolastre  was he ay
His hye estat  assured hym in pryde
But ffortune caste hym down  and ther he lay
And sodeynly  his regne gan dyuyde
 A feste he made  vnto hise lordes alle
Vpon a tyme  and made hem blithe be
And thanne hise Officers  gan he calle
Gooth bryngeth forth  the vessels quod he
Whiche that my fader  in his prosperitee
Out of the temple of Ierusalem  birafte
And to oure hye goddes  thanke we
Of honour  that oure eldres  with vs lafte
 His wyf  hise lordes  and hise concubynes
Ay dronken  whil hire appetites laste
Out of thise noble vessels  sondry wynes
And on a wal  this kyng hise eyen caste
And say an hand armlees  that wroot ful faste
ffor feere of which  he quook  and siked soore
This hand  þat Balthasar so soore agaste
Wroot Mane techel phares  and namoore
  
 In al that land  Magicien was noon  
That koude expounde  what that lettre mente
But Danyel  expowned it anoon
And seyde  Kyng god to thy fader lente
Glorie  and honour  regne  tresor  rente
And he was proud  and no thyng god ne dradde
And therfore  god greet wreche vpon hym sente
And hym birefte  the regne þat he hadde
 He was out cast of mannes compaignye
With Asses  was his habitacion
And eet hey as a beest in weet and drye
Til þat he knew  by grace  and by reson
That god of heuene  han domynacion
Ouer euery regne  and euery creature
And thanne  hadde god of hym compassion
And hym restored  his regne and his figure
 Eke  thow that art his sone  art proud also
And knowest Alle thise thynges verraily
And art rebel to god  and art his fo
Thow drank eek  of his vessel boldely
Thy wyf eke  and thy wenches synfully
Dronke of the same vessels  sondry wynys
And heriest false goddes cursedly
Therfore to thee  yshapen ful greet pyne is
 This hand was sent fro god  that on the wal
Wroot Mane techel phares  truste me
Thy regne is doon  thow weyest noght at al
Dyuyded is thy regne  and it shal be
To Medes and to Perses  yeuen quod he
And thilke same nyght this kyng was slawe
And Darius  occupieth his degree
Though he ther to  hadde neither right ne lawe
  
 Lordynges  ensample heerby may ye take
How that in lordshipe  is no sikernesse
ffor whan ffortune  wol a man forsake
She bereth awey  his regne and his richesse
And eke hise freendes  bothe moore and lesse
ffor what man  þat hath freendes thurgh ffortune
Mishape  wol make hem enemys I gesse
This prouerbe  is ful sooth  and ful commune
CEnobia  of Palymerie queene  
As writen Perciens  of hir noblesse
So worthy was in Armes  and so keene
That no wight passed hire in hardynesse
Ne in lynage  ne oother gentilesse
Of kynges blood of Perce  is she descended
I sey nat þat she hadde moost fairnesse
But of hir shape  she myghte nat been amended
 ffrom hire childhede  I fynde þat she fledde
Office of wommen  and to wode she wente
And many  a wilde hertes blood she shedde
With Arwes brode  that she to hem sente
She was so swift þat she anoon hem hente
And whan þat she was elder  she wolde kille
Leons  Leopardes  and Beres al torente
And in hir Armes  welde hem at hir wille
 Sche dorste  wilde beestes dennes seke
And rennen in the montaynes  al the nyght
And slepen vnder the bussh  and she koude eke
Wrastlen  by verray force  and verray myght
With any yong man  were he neuer so wight
Ther myghte no thyng in hir armes stonde
She kepte hir maydenhede  from euery wight
To no man  deigned hire to be bonde
  
 But atte laste  hir freendes han hire maryed
To Onedake  a prynce of that contree
Al were it so  that she hem longe taryed
And ye shal vnderstande  how þat he
Hadde swiche fantasies  as hadde she
But nathelees  whan they weere knyt in feere
They lyued  in ioye  and in felicitee
ffor ech of hem  hadde oother lief and deere
 Saue o thyng that she wolde neuere assente
By no wey  that he sholde by hire lye
But ones  for it was hir pleyn entente
To haue a child  the world to multiplye
And also soone  as that she myghte espye
That she was nat with childe  with that dede
Thanne wolde she suffren hym doon his fantasye
Eft soone  and noght but ones  out of drede
 And if she were with childe  at thilke cast  
Namoore  sholde he pleyen thilke game
Til fully  xl dayes weren past
Thanne wolde she ones  suffre hym do the same
Al were this Onedake  wilde  or tame
He gat namoore of hire  for thus she seyde
It was to wyues  lecherie and shame
In oother cas  if þat men with hem pleyde
 Two sones  by this Onedake hadde she
The whiche she kepte  in vertu and lettrure
But now  vnto oure tale turne we
I seye  so worshipful a creature
And wys therwith  and large with mesure
So penyble in the werre  and curteis eke
Ne moore labour  myghte in werre endure
Was noon  thogh al this world men sholde seke
  
 Hir riche array  ne myghte nat be toold
As wel in vessel  as in hire clothyng
She was al clad  in perree and in gold
And eek she lafte noght for noon huntyng
To haue  of sondry tonges ful knowyng
Whan þat she leyser hadde  and for to entende
To lerne bookes  was al hir likyng
How she in vertu  myghte hir lyf despende
 And shortly  of this storie for to trete
So doughty was hire housbonde  and eek she
That they conquered  manye regnes grete
In thorient with many a fair Citee
Appertenant vnto the magestee
Of Rome  and with strong hond  heeld hem ful faste
Ne neuere myghte  hir fomen  doon hem flee
Ay  whil that Onedakes dayes laste
 Hir batailles  who so list hem for to rede
Agayn Sapor the kyng and othere mo
And how  þat al this proces  fil in dede
Why she conquered  and what title ther to
And after  of hire meschief and hire wo
How that she was  biseged and ytake
Lat hym  vnto my maister Petrak go
That writ ynow of this  I vndertake
 Whan Onedake was deed  she myghtily  
The regnes heeld  and with hire propre hond
Agayns hir foos  she faught so cruelly
That ther nas kyng ne Prince in al that lond
That he nas glad  if he þat grace fond
That she ne wolde  vpon his land werreye
With hire  they made alliance by bond
To been in pees  and lete hire ryde and pleye
  
 The Emperour of Rome  Claudius
Ne hym biforn  the Romayn Galien
Ne dorsten neuere  been so corageus
Ne noon Ermyn  ne noon Egipcien
No Surryen  ne noon Arabien
WithInne the feeldes  þat dorste with hire fighte
Lest þat she wolde  hem with hir handes slen
Or with hire meynee  putten hem to flighte
 In kynges habit wenten hire sones two
As heires  of hir fadres regnes alle
And Hermanno  and Thymalao
Hir names weere  as Persiens hem calle
But ay ffortune  hath in hire hony galle
This myghty queene  may no while endure
ffortune  out of hir regne made hire falle
To wrecchednesse  and to mysauenture
 Aurelian  whan þat the gouernance
Of Rome  cam into hise handes tweye
He shoope  vpon this queene  to doon vengeance
And with his legions  he took his weye
Toward Cenobie  and shortly for to seye
He made hire flee  and atte laste hire hente
And fettred hire  and eek hire children tweye
And wan the land  and hoom to Rome he wente
 Amonges othere thynges  that he wan
His Chaar  þat was with gold wroght and perree
This grete Romayn  this Aurelian
Hath with hym lad  for þat men sholde it see
Biforn his triumphe  walketh she
With gilte cheynes  on hire nekke hangynge
Corowned was she  as after hire degree
And ful of perree  charged hir clothynge
    
 Allas ffortune  she that whilom was  
Dredeful  to kynges  and to Emperoures
Now gawreth al the peple  on hire allas
And she that helmed was  in starke stoures
And wan by force  townes stronge and toures
Shal on hire heed  now were a vitremyte
And she þat bar  the Ceptre ful of floures
Shal bere a distaf hire cost for to quyte
Al though  that Nero were vicius
As any feend  that lyth ful lowe adown
Yet he  as telleth vs Swetonius
This wide world  hadde in subieccioun
Bothe Est and West North  and Septemtrioun
Of Rubies  Saphires  and of perles white
Were alle hise clothes  browded vp and doun
ffor he in gemmes  greetly gan delite
 Moore delicat moore pompous of array
Moore proud  was neuere Emperour than he
That ilke clooth  that he hadde weryd o day
After that tyme  he nolde it neuere see
Nettes of gold threed  hadde he greet plentee
To fisshen in Tybre  whan hym liste pleye
Hise lustes were al lawe  in his decree
ffor ffortune  as his freend  hym wolde obeye
 He Rome brende  for his delicacie
The Senatours  he slow vpon a day
To heere  how þat men wolde wepe and crye
And slow his brother  and by his suster lay
His moder he made  in pitous array
ffor he hire wombe slytte  to biholde
Where he conceyued was  so weilaway
That he so litel  of his moder tolde
    
 No teere out of hise eyen  for that sighte
Ne cam  but seyde  a fair womman was she
Greet wonder is  how þat he koude  or myghte
Be domesman  of hire dede beautee
The wyn to bryngen hym  comanded he
And drank anoon  noon oother wo he made
Whan myght is ioyned  vnto crueltee
Allas to depe  wol the venym wade
 In youthe  a maister hadde this Emperour  
To teche hym lettrure  and curteisye
ffor of moralitee  he was the flour
As in his tyme  but if bookes lye
And whil this maister  hadde of hym maistrye
He maked hym  so louyng and so souple
That longe tyme it was  er tirannye
Or any vice  dorste in hym vncouple
 This Seneca  of which þat I deuyse
By cause Nero  hadde of hym swich drede
ffor he fro vices  wolde hym ay chastise
Discretly  as by word  and nat by dede
Sire wolde he seyn  an Emperour moot nede
Be vertuous  and hate tirannye
ffor which he in a bath  made hym to blede
On bothe hise armes  til he moste dye
 This Nero  hadde eek  of acustumance
In youthe  agayns his maister for to rise
Which afterward  hym thoughte a greet greuance
Therfore  he made hym dyen in this wise
But nathelees  this Seneca the wise
Chees  in a bath  to dye in this manere
Rather than han  another tormentrise
And thus hath Nero  slayn his maister deere
    
 Now fil it so  that ffortune liste no lenger
The hye pride of Nero  to cherice
ffor thogh þat he was strong yet was she strenger
She thoghte thus  by god I am to nyce
To sette a man  that is fulfild of vice
In heigh degree  and Emperour hym calle
By god  out of his sete I wol hym trice
Whan he leest weneth  sonnest shal he falle
 The peple roos  vp on hym  on a nyght
ffor his defaute  and whan he it espied
Out of his dores  anon he hath hym dight
Allone  and there he wende han been allyed
He knokked faste  and ay the moore he cryed
The faster shette they  the dores alle
ffor drede of this  hym thoughte þat he dyed
And wente his wey  no lenger dorste he calle
 The peple cryde  and rombled vp and doun  
That with hise erys  herde he  how they seyde
Where is this false tirant this Neroun
ffor fere almoost out of his wit he breyde
And to hise goddes  pitously he preyde
ffor socour  but it myghte noght bityde
ffor drede of this  hym thoughte þat he deyde
And ran in to a gardyn  hym to hyde
 And in this gardyn  foond he cherles tweye
That seten by a fyr  greet and reed
And to thise cherlis two  he gan to preye
To sleen hym  and to girden of his heed
That to his body  whan þat he were deed
Were no despit ydoon  for his defame
Hym self he slow  he koude no bettre reed
Of which  ffortune  lough and hadde a game

 Was neuere Capitayn  vnder a kyng
That regnes mo  putte in subieccioun
Ne strenger was in feeld  of alle thyng
As in his tyme  ne gretter of renoun
Ne moore pompous  in heigh presumpcioun
Than Oloferne  which ffortune ay kiste
So likerously  and ladde hym vp and doun
Til þat his heed was of  er that he wiste
 Nat oonly  that this world hadde hym in awe
ffor lesynge  of richesse  or libertee
But made euery man  reneyen his lawe
Nabugodonosor  was god seyde he
Noon oother god  sholde adoured be
Agayns this heste  no wight dorste trespace
Saue in Bethulia  a strong Citee
Where Eliachym  a preest was of that place
 But tak kepe  of the deeth of Oloferne
Amydde his oost he dronke lay a nyght
WithInne his tente  large as is a berne
And yet for al his pompe  and al his myght
Iudith a womman  as he lay vpright
Slepynge  his heed of smoot and from his tente
fful pryuely she stal  from euery wight
And with his heed  vnto hir toun she wente
What nedeth it of kyng Anthiochus  
To telle  his hye Roial magestee
His hye pryde  hise werkes venymus
ffor swich another  was ther noon as he
Reed which that he was  in Machabee
And reed  the proude wordes  þat he seyde
And why he fil  fro heigh prosperitee
And in an Hille  how wrecchedly he deyde
    
 ffortune  hym hadde enchaunted so in pride
That verraily  he wende he myghte attayne
Vnto the sterres  vp on euery syde
And in balance  weyen ech montayne
And alle the floodes  of the see restrayne
And goddes peple  hadde he moost in hate
Hem wolde he sleen  in torment and in payne
Wenynge  that god ne myghte  his pryde abate
 And for that Nichanore  and Thymothe
Of Iewes  weren venquysshed myghtily
Vnto the Iewes  swich an hate hadde he
That he bad greithe his Chaar ful hastily
And swoor  and seyde ful despitously
Vnto Ierusalem  he wolde eft soone
To wreken his Ire  on it ful cruelly
But of his purpos  he was let ful soone
 God for his manace  hym so soore smoot
With invisible wounde  ay incurable
That in hise guttes  carf it so and boot
That hise peynes  weren inportable
And certeinly  the wreche was resonable
ffor many a mannes guttes  dide he peyne
But from his purpos  cursed and dampnable
ffor al his smert he wolde hym nat restreyne
 But bad anon  apparaillen his hoost
And sodeynly  er he was of it war
God daunted  al his pride  and al his boost
ffor he  so soore fil  out of his char
That it hise lymes  and his skyn totar
So þat  he neither myghte go ne ryde
But in a chayer  men aboute hym bar
Al forbrused  bothe bak and syde
    
 The wreche of god  hym smoot so cruelly  
That thurgh his body  wikked wormes crepte
And ther with al  he stank so horribly
That noon  of al his meynee þat hym kepte
Wheither so he wook or ellis slepte
Ne myghte noght for stynk of hym endure
Is this meschief  he wayled and eek wepte
And knew god  lord of euery creature
 To al his hoost and to hym self also
fful wlatsom  was the stynk of his careyne
No man  ne myght hym bere to ne fro
And in this stynk and this horrible peyne
He starf ful wrecchedly  in a monteyne
Thus hath this Robbour  and this homycide
That many a man  made to wepe and pleyne
Swich gerdon  as bilongeth vnto pryde
The Storie of Alisandre  is so commune
That euery wight þat hath discrecion
Hath herd somwhat or al  of his fortune
This wide world  as in conclusion
He wan by strengthe  or for hys hye renon
They were glad  for pees vnto hym sende
The pryde  of man and beest  he leyde adoun
Where so he cam  vnto the worldes ende
 Comparison  myghte neuere yet ben maked
Bitwixe hym  and another Conquerour
ffor al this world  for drede of hym hath quaked
He of knyghthod  and of fredom flour
ffortune hym made  the heir of hire honour
Saue wyn and wommen  no thyng myghte aswage
His hye entente  in armes and labour
So was he ful  of leonyn corage
    
 What prys were it to hym  thogh I yow tolde
Of Darius  and an hundred thousand mo
Of kynges  Prynces  Dukes  Erles bolde
Whiche he conquered  and broghte hem into wo
I seye  as fer  as man may ride or go
The world was his  what sholde I moore deuyse
ffor thogh I write  or tolde yow euere mo
Of his knyghthode  it myghte nat suffise
welf yeer he regned  as seith Machabee  
Philippes sone of Macidoyne  he was
That first was kyng in Grece the contree
O worthy  gentil Alisandre allas
That euere  sholde fallen swich a cas
Empoysoned  of thyn owene folk thow weere
Thyn sys  ffortune hath turned into Aas
And for thee  ne weep she neuer a teere
 Who shal me yeue teeris  to compleyne
The deeth  of gentilesse  and of franchise
That al this world  weldid in his demeyne
And yet hym thoughte  it myghte nat suffise
So ful was his corage  of heigh emprise
Allas  who shal me helpe to endite
ffalse ffortune  and poyson to despise
The whiche two  of al this wo I wyte
By wisdom  manhede  and by greet labour
ffrom humble bed  to Roial magestee
Vp roos  he Iulius the Conquerour
That wan al the Occident by land and see
By strengthe of hond  or ellis by tretee
And vnto Rome  made hem tributarie
And sith of Rome  the Emperour was he
Til that ffortune  weex his Aduersarie
    
 O myghty Cesar  that in Thessalie
Agayn Pompeus  fader thyn in lawe
That of thorient hadde al the chiualrie
As fer  as þat the day bigynneth dawe
Thow  thurgh thy knyghthod  hast hem take and slawe
Saue fewe folk þat with Pompeus fledde
Thurgh which  thow puttest al Thorient in Awe
Thanke ffortune  that so wel thee spedde
 But now a litel while  I wol biwaille
This Pompeus  this noble gouernour
Of Rome  which þat fleigh at this bataille
I seye  oon of hise men  a fals traitour
His heed of smoot to wynnen hym fauour
Of Iulius  and hym the heed he broghte
Allas Pompeie  of Thorient conquerour
That ffortune  vnto swich a fyn thee broghte
 To Rome agayn  repaireth Iulius  
With his triumphe  lauriat ful hye
But on a tyme  Brutus Cassius
That euere hadde  of his heighe estat enuye
fful pryuely  hath maad conspiracie
Agayns this Iulius  in subtil wise
And caste the place  in which he sholde dye
With Boydekyns  as I shal yow deuyse
 This Iulius  to the Capitolie wente
Vpon a day  as he was wont to goon
And in the Capitolie  anon hym hente
This false Brutus  and hise othere foon
And stiked hym  with Boydekyns anon
With many a wounde  and thus they lete hym lye
But neuere gronte he  at no strook but oon
Or ellis at two  but if his storie lye
    
 So manly  was this Iulius of herte
And so wel  louede estatly honestee
And thogh hise deedly woundes  so sore smerte
His mantel ouer his hipes  caste he
ffor no man  sholde seen his pryuetee
And as he lay  of dyyng in a traunce
And wiste verraily that deed was he
Of honestee  yet hadde he remembraunce
 Lucan  to thee this storie I recomende
And to Sweton  and to Valerius also
That of this storie  writen word and ende
How that to thise grete Conquerours two
ffortune  was first freend  and siththe a foo
No man ne triste  vpon hire fauour longe
But haue hire  in awayt for euere mo
Witnesse  on alle thise Conquerours stronge
This riche Cresus  whilom kyng of Lyde
Of which Cresus  Cirus soore hym dradde
Yet was he caught amyddes al his pryde
And to be brent men to the fyr hym ladde
But swich a reyn  doun fro the welkne shadde
That slow the fyr  and made hym to escape
But to be war  no grace yet he hadde
Til ffortune  on the galwes made hym gape
anne he escaped was  he kan nat stente  
ffor to bigynne  a newe werre agayn
He wende wel  for þat ffortune hym sente
Swich hape  that he escaped thurgh the rayn
That of his foos  he myghte nat be slayn
And eek a sweuene  vpon a nyght he mette
Of which  he was so proud  and eek so fayn
That in vengeance  he al his herte sette
      
 Vp on a tree he was  as þat hym thoughte
Ther Iuppiter hym wessh  bothe bak and syde
And Phebus eek  a fair towaille hym broughte
To drye hym with  and therfore wax his pryde
And to his doghter  that stood hym bisyde
Which that he knew  in heigh sentence habounde
And bad hire telle hym  what it signyfide
And she his dreem  bigan right thus expounde
 The tree quod she  the galwes is to mene
And Iuppiter  bitokneth snow and reyn
And Phebus  with his towaille so clene
Tho been  the sonnes stremes for to seyn
Thow shalt an hanged be  fader certeyn
Reyn shal thee wasshe  and sonne shal thee drye
Thus warned hym  ful plat and ful pleyn
His doghter  which þat called was Phanye
 An hanged was Cresus  the proude kyng
His Roial trone  myghte hym nat auaille
Tragedies noon oother manere thyng
Ne kan in syngyng crye ne biwaille
But þat ffortune  alwey wole assaille
With vnwar strook the regnes þat been proude
ffor whan men trusteth hire  thanne wol she faille
And couere hire brighte face  with a clowde
O noble  o worthy Petro  glorie of Spayne
Whom ffortune heeld  so heighe in magestee
Wel oghten men  thy pitous deeth complayne
Out of thy land  thy brother made thee flee
And after at a sege  by subtiltee
Thow were bitraysed  and lad vnto his tente
Where as he  with his owene hand slow thee
Succedynge  in thy regne and in thy rente
    
 The feeld of snow  with thegle of blak therInne  
Caught with the lymrod  coloured as the glede

The wikked nest was werkere of this nede

Of which  thyne owene liges hadde envie
And for no thyng but for thy chiualrie
They in thy bed  han slayn thee by the morwe
Thus kan ffortune  hire wheel gouerne and gye
And out of ioye  brynge men to sorwe
Of Melan  grete Barnabo Viscounte
God of delit and scourge of Lumbardye
Why sholde I noght thyn Infortune acounte
Sith in estat thow clombe were so hye
Thy brother sone  that was thy double allye
ffor he thy Nevew was  and sone in lawe
WithInne his prison  made thee to dye
But why ne how  noot I that thow were slawe
Of the Erl Hugelyn of Pize  the langour
Ther may no tonge  tellen for pitee
But litel out of Pize  stant a tour
In which tour  in prison put was he
And with hym been  hise litel children thre
The eldeste scarsly  fyue yeer was of age
Allas ffortune  it was greet crueltee
Swiche briddes  for to putte in swich a cage
    
 Dampned was he  to dyen in that prison
ffor Roger  which þat bisshope was of Pize
Hadde on hym maad  a fals suggestion
Thurgh which the peple  gan vp on hym rise
And putten hym to prison  in swich wise
As ye han herd  and mete and drynke he hadde
So smal  that wel vnnethe it may suffise
And ther with al  it was ful poure and badde
nd on a day bifel  þat in that hour
Whan þat his mete  wont was to be broght
The Gayler  shette the dores of the tour
He herde it wel  but he spak  right noght
And in his herte  anon ther fil a thoght
That they for hunger  wolde doon hym dyen
Allas quod he  allas þat I was wroght
Ther with  the teeris fillen from hise eyen
 His yonge sone  þat thre yeer was of age
Vnto hym seyde  fader  fader  why do ye wepe
Whanne wol the Gayler  bryngen oure potage
Is ther no morsel breed  þat ye do kepe
I am so hungry  that I may nat slepe
Now wolde god  þat I myghte slepen euere
Thanne sholde noght hunger  in my wombe crepe
Ther is no thyng but breed  þat me were leuere
 Thus day by day  this child bigan to crye
Til in his fadres barm  adoun it lay
And seyde  farewel fader  I moot dye
And kiste his fader  and deyde the same day
And whan the woful fader  deed it say
ffor wo  hise armes two  he gan to byte
And seyde  allas ffortune and weylaway
Thy false wheele  my wo al may I wyte
  
 Hise children wende  that it for hunger was
That he hise armes gnow  and nat for wo
And seyden fader  do nat so allas
But rather  ete the flessh vpon vs two
Oure flessh thow yaf taak oure flessh vs fro
And ete ynow  right thus they to hym seyde
And after that withInne a day  or two
They leyde hem  in his lappe adoun  and deyde
 Hym self despeired  eek  for hunger starf
Thus ended is  this myghty Erl of Pize
ffrom heigh estat ffortune awey hym carf
Of this tragedie  it oghte ynogh suffise
Who so wole it heere it in a lenger wise

A poore widwe  som del stape in age

Biside a groue  stondyng in a dale
This widwe  of which I telle yow my tale
Syn thilke day  þat she was last a wyf
In pacience  ladde a ful symple lyf
ffor  litel was hire catel and hire rente
By housbondrye  of swich as god hire sente
She foond hire self  and eek hire doghtren two
Thre large sowes  hadde she and namo
Thre kyn  and eek a sheepe  þat highte Malle
fful sooty was hire bour  and eek hire halle
In which she eet ful many a sklendre meel
Of poynant sawce  hir neded neuer a deel
No deyntee morsel  passed thurgh hir throte
Hir diete  was acordant to hir cote
Repleccion  ne made hire neuere syk
Attempree diete  was al hire phisyk
And excercise  and hertes suffisaunce
The gowte  lette hire no thyng for to daunce
Napoplexie  shente nat hire heed
No wyn ne drank she  neither whit ne reed
Hire bord was serued  moost with whit and blak
Milk and broun breed  in which she foond no lak
Seynd bacon  and som tyme an Ey  or tweye
ffor she was  as it were  a maner deye
A yeerd she hadde  enclosed al aboute
With stikkes  and a drye dych withoute
In which  she hadde a cok heet Chantecler
In al the land  of crowyng nas his peer
  
His voys was murier  than the myrie Orgon
On massedayes  þat in the chirche gon
Wel sikerer  was his crowyng in his logge
Than is a Clokke  or any Abbey Orlogge
By nature  he knew ech ascencion
Of equinoxial  in thilke town
ffor whan degrees xv  were ascended  
Thanne krew he  þat it myghte nat ben amended
His komb  was redder  than the fyn coral
And batayled  as it were a Castel wal
His byle was blak and as the Ieet it shoon
Lyk Asure  were hise legges and his toon
Hise nayles whitter  than the lylye flour
And lyk the burned gold  was his colour
This gentil cok hadde in his gouernaunce
Seuene hennes  for to doon al his plesaunce
Whiche were hise sustres  and his paramours
And wonder lyke to hym  as of colours
Of whiche  the faireste hewed on hire throte
Was clepid  faire damoysele Pertelote
Curteys she was  discret and debonaire
And compaignable  and bar hir self so faire
Syn thilke day  þat she was seuen nyght oold
That trewely  she hath the herte in hoold
Of Chantecler  loken in euery lyth
He loued hire so  þat wel was hym ther with
But swich a ioye was it to here hem synge
Whan þat  the brighte sonne gan to sprynge
In swete acord  my leef is faren in londe
ffor thilke tyme  as I haue vnderstonde
Beestes  and briddes  kouden speke and synge
And so bifel  þat in a dawenynge
As Chantecler  among hise wyues alle
Sat on his perche  that was in the halle
And next hym sat this faire Pertelote
This Chantecler  gan gronen in his throte
  
As man  þat in his dreem  is drecched soore
 And whan þat Pertelote  thus herde hym rore
She was agast and seyde herte deere
What eyleth yow · to grone in this manere
Ye ben a verray slepere  fy for shame
 And he answerde  and seyde thus  madame
I prey yow  þat ye take it nat agrief
By god me mette  I was in swich meschief
Right now  þat yet myn herte is soore afright
Now god quod he  my sweuene recche aright

  nd kepe my body  out of foul prisoun
Me mette  how that I romed vp and doun
WithInne oure yeerd  where as I say a beest
Was lyk an hound  and wolde han maad arest
Vpon my body  and han had me ded
His colour  was bitwixe yelow and red
And tipped was his tayl  and bothe hise erys
With blak vnlik the remenant of hise herys
His snowte smal  with glowyng eyen tweye
Yet of his look for fere almoost I deye
This caused me  my gronyng doutelees
 Avoy quod she  fy on yow hertelees
Allas quod she  for by that god aboue
Now han ye lost myn herte and al my loue
I kan nat loue a Coward  by my feith
ffor certes  what so any womman seith
We alle desiren  if it myghte be
To han housbondes  hardy  wise and fre
And secree  and no nygard  ne no fool
Ne hym  þat is agast of euery tool
Ne noon auauntour  by that god aboue
How dorste ye seyn  for shame  vnto youre loue
That any thyng myghte make yow aferd
Haue ye no mannes herte  and han a berd
Allas  and konne ye ben agast of sweuenys
No thyng god woot but vanytee in sweuene is
  
Sweuenes  engendren of replexions
And ofte  of fume  and of complexions
Whan humours  ben to habundant in a wight
Certes this dreem  which ye han met to nyght
Comth  of the grete superfluitee
Of youre rede Colera pardee
Which causeth folk  to dreden in hir dremes
Of Arwes  and of fyr with rede lemes
Of rede bestes  that they wol hem byte
Of contek and of whelpes grete and lyte
Right as the humour  of Malencolie
Causeth ful many a man  in sleepe to crie
ffor fere of blake beres  or boles blake
Or ellis  blake deueles wol hem take
Of othere humours  koude I telle also  
That werken many a man  in sleep ful wo
But I wol passe  as lightly as I kan
Lo Caton which þat was so wys a man
Seyde he nat thus  ne do no fors of dremes
Now sire quod she  whan we fle fro thise bemes
ffor goddes loue  as taak som laxatif
Vp peril of my soule  and of my lif
I conseile yow the beste  I wol nat lye
That bothe of Colere  and of Malencolye
Ye purge yow  and for ye shal nat tarye
Thogh in this town  is noon Apothecarye
I shal my self  to herbes techen yow
That shul ben  for youre heele and for youre prow
And in oure yerd  tho herbes shal I fynde
The whiche han  of hire propretee by kynde
To purge yow  bynethe and eek aboue
fforyet nat this  for goddes owene loue
Ye ben ful colerik of complexion
Ware the sonne  in his Ascencion
Ne fynde yow nat replet of humours hote
And if it do  I dar wel leye a grote
  
That ye shul haue  a feuere terciane
Or an Agew  þat may be youre bane
A day  or two  ye shul han degestyues
Of wormes  er ye take youre laxatyues
Of Lauriol  Centaure and ffumetere
Or ellis of Ellebor  that groweth there
Of Katapuce  or of Gaytrys beryis
Of herbe yue growyng in oure yerd  they merye is
Pekke hem vp right as ther growe  and ete hem In
Be myrie housbonde  for youre fader kyn
Dredeth no dreem  I kan sey yow namoore
 Madame quod he  grant mercy of youre loore
But nathelees  as touchyng dann Catoun
That hath of wisdom  swich a gret renoun
Thogh þat he bad  no dremes for to drede
By god men may  in olde bokes rede
Of many a man  moore of auctoritee
Than euere Caton was  so mote I thee

  hat al the reuers seyn  of his sentence
And han wel founden  by experience
That dremes  ben signyficacions
As wel  of ioye  as tribulacions
That folk enduren  in this lyf present
Ther nedeth  make of this noon argument
The verray preue  sheweth it in dede
 Oon of the gretteste Auctour  þat men rede
Seith thus  þat whilom two felawes wente
On pilgrymage  in a ful good entente
And happed so  they coomen in a town
Where as ther was  swich congregacioun
Of peple  and eek so streit of herbergage
That they ne founde  as muche as o cotage
In which they bothe  myghte ylogged be
Wherfore  they mosten of necessitee
As for that nyght departe compaignye
And ech of hem  gooth to his hostelrye
  
And took his loggyng as it wolde falle
That oon of hem  was logged in a stalle
ffer in a yeerd  with oxen of the plow
That oother man  was logged wel ynow
As was his auenture  or his fortune
That vs gouerneth alle  as in commune
And so bifel  þat longe  er it were day
This man mette in his bed  ther as he lay
How þat his felawe  gan vpon hym calle
And seyde allas  for in an Oxes stalle
This nyght I shal be mordred ther I lye
Now help me deere brother  or I dye
In alle haste  com to me  he sayde
 This man  out of his sleepe  for feere abrayde
But whan þat he was wakned  of his sleep
He turned hym  and took of this no keepe
Hym thoughte  his dreem nas but a vanytee
Thus twies  in his slepyng dremed he
And atte thridde tyme  yet his felawe
Cam as hym thoughte  and seyde I am now slawe
Bihoold my blody woundes  depe and wyde
Arys vp erly  in the morwe tyde
And atte Westgate of the town quod he  
A Carte ful of donge  ther shaltow se
In which  my body is hyd ful priuely
Do thilke Cart aresten boldely
My gold caused my mordre  sooth to seyn
And tolde hym euery poynt how he was sleyn
With a ful pitous face  pale of hewe
And truste wel  his dreem he fond ful trewe
ffor on the morwe  as soone as it was day
To his felawes In  he took the way
And whan þat he cam  to this Oxes stalle
After his felawe  he bigan to calle
 The hostiler  answerde hym anon
And seyde  sire  youre felawe is agon
  
As soone as day  he wente out of the town
 This man  gan fallen in suspecioun
Remembrynge  on hise dremes þat he mette
And forth he goth  no lenger wolde he lette
Vnto the westgate of the town  and fond
A dong Carte  went as it were to donge lond
That was arrayed  in that same wise
As ye han herd  the dede man deuyse
And with an hardy herte  he gan to crye
Vengeaunce  and Iustice  of this felonye
My felawe  mordred is  this same nyght
And in this Cart heere  he lyth gapyng vpright
I crye  on the Mynystres  quod he
That sholde kepe  and rulen this Citee
Harrow  allas  heere lyth my felawe slayn
What sholde I moore  vnto this tale sayn
The peple vp sterte  and caste the Cart to grounde
And in the myddel of the dong they founde
The dede man  þat mordred was al newe
 O blisful god  þat art so Iust and trewe
Lo  how þat thow biwreyest mordre alway
Mordre wol out that se we day by day
Mordre  is so wlatsom  and abhomynable
To god  that is so Iust and resonable
That he ne wod nat suffre it helyd be
Though it abyde  a yeer  or two  or thre

  ordre wol out this my conclusioun
And right anon  Ministres of that town
Han hent the Cartere  and so soore hym pyned
And eek the hostiler  so sore engyned
That they biknewe  hire wikkednesse anon
And were anhanged  by the nekke bon
Heere may men sen  þat dremes ben to drede
 And certes  in the same book I rede
Right in the nexte Chapitre  after this
I gabbe nat so haue I ioye or blys
  
Two men  þat wolde han passed ouer see
ffor certeyn cause  into a fer contree
If þat the wynd  ne hadde ben contrarie
That made hem  in a Citee for to tarie
That stood ful myrie  vp on an hauen syde
But on a day  agayn the euen tyde
The wynd gan chaunge  and blew right as hem leste
Iolif and glad  they wenten vnto reste
And casten hem  ful erly for to sayle
But herkneth  to that o man  fil a gret meruaille
 That oon of hem  in slepyng as he lay
Hym mette a wonder dreem  agayn the day
Hym thoughte  a man stood  by his beddes syde
And hym comanded  þat he sholde abyde
And seyde hym thus  if thow tomorwe wende
Thow shalt be dreynt my tale is at an ende
 He wook  and tolde his felawe what he mette
And preyde hym  his viage to lette
As for that day  he preyde hym to byde
 His felawe  þat lay  by his beddes syde
Gan for to laughe  and scorned hym ful faste
No dreem quod he  may so myn herte agaste
That I wol lette  for to do my thynges
I sette nat a straw  by thy dremynges
ffor sweuenes ben  but vanytees and Iapes
Men dreme al day  of Owles  or of Apes
And of many a maze  ther with al
Men dreme of thyng þat neuere was ne shal
But sith I see  þat thow wolt here abyde
And thus forslewthen  wilfully thy tyde
God woot it reweth me  and haue good day  
And thus  he took his leue  and wente his way
But er þat he  hadde half his cours yseyled
Noot I nat why  ne what meschaunce it eyled
But casuelly  the shippes botme rente
And shipe and man  vnder the water wente
  
In sighte of othere shippes  it bisyde
That with hem seyled  at the same tyde
And therfore  faire Pertelote so deere
By swiche ensamples olde  maystow leere
That no man  sholde ben to recchelees
Of dremes  for I sey thee doutelees
That many a dreem  ful soore is for to drede
 Lo  in the lyf of Seint Kenelm I rede
That was Kenulphus sone  the noble Kyng
Of Mertenrike  how Kenelm mette a thyng
Alite  er he was mordred  on a day
His mordre  in his auysion he say
His norice  hym expowned euery del
His sweuene  and bad hym for to kepe hym wel
ffor trayson  but he nas but vij yeer old
And therfore  litel tale hath he told
Of any dreem  so holy was his herte
By god  I hadde leuere than my sherte
That ye hadde rad his legende  as haue I
Dame Pertelote  I sey yow trewely
Macrobeus  that writ the Auysion
In Affrike  of the worthy Cipion
Affermeth dremes  and seith þat they ben
Warnynge of thynges  þat men after sen
 And forther moore  I pray yow looketh wel
In the olde testament of Danyel
If he heeld dremes  any vanytee
 Rede eek of Ioseph  and there shul ye see
Wher dremes be som tyme  I sey nat alle
Warnynge of thynges  þat shul after falle
 Looke of Egipte  the Kyng Daun Pharao
His bakere  and his butiller also
Wher they ne felte  noon effect in dremes
Who so wol seke  Actes of sondry Remes

  ay rede of dremes  many a wonder thyng
 Lo Cresus  which þat was of Lyde kyng
  
Mette he nat þat he sat vpon a tree
Which signyfide  he sholde an hanged be
 Lo here Andromacha  Ectores wyf
That day that Ector  sholde lese his lyf
She dremed  on the same nyght biforn
How þat the lyf of Ector sholde be lorn
If thilke day  he wente into bataille
She warned hym  but it myghte nat auaille
He wente for to fighte  nathelees
And he was slayn anon  of Achilles
But thilke tale  is al to long to telle
And eek  it is ney day  I may nat dwelle
Shortly I seye  as for conclusion
That I shal han  of this auysion
Aduersitee  and I seye forther moor
That I ne telle  of laxat·yues no stoor
ffor they ben venymes  I woot it wel
I hem deffie  I loue hem neuer a del
 Now lat vs speke of myrthe and stynte al this
Madame Pertelote  so haue I blys
Of o thyng god hath sent me large grace
ffor whan I se  the beautee  of youre face
Ye ben so scarlet reed  aboute youre eyen
It maketh  al my drede for to deyen
ffor also siker  as In principio
Mulier  est hominis confusio
Madame  the sentence  of this latyn is
Womman  is mannes ioye and al his blys
ffor whan I feele a nyght youre softe syde
Al be it þat I may nat on yow ryde
ffor þat oure perche  is maad so narwe allas
I am so ful  of Ioye and of solas
That I deffie  bothe sweuene and dreem
And with that word  he fley doun fro the beem
ffor it was day  and eke hise hennes alle
And with a chuk he gan hem for to calle
  
ffor he hadde founde a corn  lay in the yerd
Real he was  he was namoore aferd
He fethered Pertelote  twenty tyme  
And trad as ofte  er it was pryme
He looketh  as it were a grym leoun
And on hise toos  he rometh vp and doun
Hym deyned nat to sette his foot to grounde
And chukketh  whan he hath a corn yfounde
And to hym rennen thanne  hise wyues alle
Thus real  as a Prince is in his halle
Leue I this Chauntecler  in his pasture
And after  wol I telle his auenture
 Whan that the Monthe  in which the world bigan
That highte March  whan god first maked man
Was complet and passed were also
Syn March bigan  30 dayes and two
Bifel  þat Chauntecler  in al his pryde
Hise seuene wyues  walkyng him bisyde
Caste vp hise eyen  to the brighte sonne
That in the signe of Taurus  hadde yronne
xx degrees and oon · and som what moore
And knew by kynde  and by noon oother loore
That it was pryme  and krew with blisful steuene
The sonne he seyde  is clomben vp on heuene
40 degrees and oon  and moore ywis
Madame Pertelote  my worldes blys
Herkneth thyse blisful bryddes  how they synge
And se the fresshe floures  how they sprynge
fful is myn herte  of reuel and solas
But sodeynly  hym fil a sorweful cas
ffor euere the latter ende of ioye  is wo
God woot þat worldly ioye  is soone ago
And if a Rethor  koude faire endite
He in a Cronycle  saufly myghte it write
As for a souereyn notabilitee
Now euery wys man  lat hym herkne me
  
This storie  is also trewe I vndertake
As is the book of Launcelot de Lake
That wommen holde  in ful gret reuerence
Now wol I  torne agayn to my sentence
 A Colfox  ful of sley Iniquitee
That in the groue  hadde woned yeres thre

   heigh ymaginacion  forncast
The same nyght thurghout the hegges brast
Into the yerd  ther Chauntecler the faire
Was wont and eek hise wyues to repaire
And in a bed of wortes  stille he lay
Til it was passed  vndren of the day
Waitynge his tyme  on Chauntecler to falle
As gladly doon  thise homycides alle
That in awayt liggen  to mordre men
O false mordrour  lurkynge in thy den
O newe Scariot newe Genylon
ffalse dissimilour  o greek Synon
That broghtest Troye  al outrely to sorwe
O Chauntecler  acursed be that morwe
That thow into the yerd  flaugh fro the bemys
Thow were  ful wel ywarned by thy dremys
That thilke day  was perilous to thee
But what þat god forwoot moot nedes be
After the opynyon of certeyn clerkis
Witnesse on hym  þat any parfit clerk is
That in scole  is gret altercacion
In this matere  and gret disputison
And hath ben  of an hundred thousand men
But I ne kan  nat bulte it to the bren
As kan  the holy doctour Augustyn
Or Boece  or the Bisshope Bradwardyn
Wheither  þat goddes worthy forewityng
Streyneth me nedely  for to doon a thyng
Nedely clepe I  symple necessitee
Or ellis  if fre choys  be graunted me
  
To do that same thyng or do it noght
Though god forwoot it er þat I was wroght
Or if his wityng streyneth neuer a del
But by necessitee  condicionel
I wol nat han to do  of swich matere
My tale is of a Cok as ye may heere
That took his conseil  of his wyf with sorwe
To walken in the yerd  vpon that morwe
That he hadde met the dreem  þat I yow tolde
Wommens conseils  be ful ofte colde
Wommannes conseil  broghte vs first to wo  
And made Adam  fro Paradys to go
Ther as he was  ful myrie and wel at ese
But for I noot to whom it myghte displese
If I conseil of wommen  wolde blame
Passe ouer  for I seyde it in my game
Rede Auctours  where they trete of swich matere
And what they seyn of wommen heere
Thise ben the Cokkes wordes and nat myne
I kan noon harm  on no womman deuyne
 ffaire in the Sond  to bathe hire myrily
Lyth Pertelote  and alle hire sustres by
Agayn the sonne  and Chauntecler so free
Song myrier  than the Mermayde in the see
ffor Phisiologus  seith sikerly
How þat they syngen  wel and myrily
 And so bifel  that as he caste his eye
Among the wortes  on a Boterflye
He was war of this fox  þat lay ful lowe
No thyng ne liste hym thanne for to crowe
But cryde anon  cok cok and vp he sterte
As man  þat was affrayd in his herte
ffor naturelly  a beest desireth flee
ffro his contrarie  if he may it see
Though he neuere erst hadde seye it with his eye
This Chauntecler  whan he gan hym espye
  
He wolde han fled  but þat the fox anon
Seyde gentil sire  allas wher wol ye gon
Be ye affrayd  of me þat am youre freend
Now certes  I were worse than a feend
If I to yow  wolde harm  or vileynye
I am nat come  youre conseil for tespye
But trewely  the cause of my comynge
Was oonly  for to herkne how þat ye synge
ffor trewely  ye han as myrie a steuene
As any Angel hath  þat is in heuene
Ther with  ye han in Musyk moore feelynge
Than hadde Boece  or any þat kan synge
My lord youre fader  god his soule blesse
And eek youre moder  of hire gentillesse

folio 105bHa
And certes sire  ful fayn wolde I yow plese
 But for men speke of syngynge  I wol seye
So mote I browke wel  myne eyen tweye
Saue ye  I herde neuere man so synge
As dide youre fader  in the morwenynge
Certes  it was of herte  al that he song
And for to make his voys  the moore strong
He wolde so peyne hym  þat with bothe hise eyen
He moste wynke  so loude he wolde cryen
And stonden on his typton  ther with al
And strecche forth his nekke  long and smal
And eek he was of swich discrecion
That ther nas no man  in no Region
That hym in song  or wisdom myghte passe
I haue wel rad  in daun Burnelle the Asse
Among hise vers  how þat ther was a cok
ffor a preestes sone  yaf hym a knok
Vpon his leg whil he was yong and nyce
He made hym  for to lese his benefice
But certeyn  ther nys no comparison
Bitwix the wisdom  and discrecion
  
Of youre fader  and of his subtiltee
Now syngeth sire  for seynte charitee
Lat se  konne ye youre fader countrefete
 This Chauntecler  hise wynges gan to bete
As man þat koude  his trayson nat espie
So was he rauysshed  with his flaterie
 Allas ye lordes  many a fals flatour
Is in youre court and many a losengeour
That plesen yow wel moore  by my feyth
Than he  þat soothfastnesse vnto yow seith
Redeth Ecclesiaste  of flaterye
Beth war ye lordes  of hir trecherye
 This Chauntecler  stood hye vp on his toos
Strecchynge his nekke  and heeld hise eyen cloos
And gan to crowe  lowde for the nones
And daun Russelle the fox  stirte vp atones
And by the gargat hente Chauntecler
And on his bak  toward the wode hym beer
ffor yet ne was ther no man  þat hym sewed  
 O destynee  þat mayst nat ben eschewed
Allas þat Chauntecler  fly fro the bemes
Allas  his wif ne roghte nat of dremes
And on a friday  fil al this meschance
 O Venus  þat art goddesse of plesance
Syn þat thy seruant was this Chauntecler
And in thy seruyce  dide al his power
Moore for delit than world to multiplie
Why woldestow suffre hym  on thy day to dye
 O Gaufred  deere maister souerayn
That whan  thy worthy kyng Richard was slayn
With shot compleynedest his deth so soore
Why ne hadde I now  thy sentence and thy loore
The friday for to chide  as diden ye
ffor on a ffriday  soothly slayn was he
Thanne wolde I shewe yow  how þat I kowde pleyne
ffor Chaunteclerys drede  and for his peyne
  
 Certes  swich cry  ne lamentacion
Was neuere of ladyes maad  whan ylion
Was wonne  and Pirrus  with his streite swerd
Whanne he hadde hent kyng Priam by the berd
And slayn hym  as seith vs Eneydos
As maden  alle the hennes in the cloos
Whan they hadde seyn  of Chauntecler the sighte
But souereynly  dame Pertelote shrighte
fful louder  than dide Hasdrubales wyf
Whan þat hire housbonde  hadde ylost his lyf
And þat the Romayns  hadden brend Cartage
She was  so ful of torment and of rage
That wilfully  vnto the fyr she sterte
And brende hir seluen  with a stedefast herte
 O woful hennes  right so cryden ye
As  whan þat Nero  brende the Citee
Of Rome  cryden the senatours wyues
ffor þat hir housbondes  losten alle hire lyues
Withouten gilt this Nero hath hem slayn
Now wol I turne  to my tale agayn
 The sely widwe  and eek hire doghtres two
Herden thise hennes crye  and maken wo

   out at dores  stirten they anon

nd seyen the fox  toward the groue gon
And bar vpon his bak the cok away
And criden  out harrow and weilaway
Ha  ha the fox  and after hym they ran
And eek with staues  many another man
Ran Colle oure dogge  and Talbot and Gerlande
And Malkyn  with a distaf in hire hande
Ran Cow and calf  and eek the verray hogges
So fered  for berkynge of the dogges
And showtynge of the men  and wommen eek
They ronne so  hem thoughte hire herte breek
They yelleden  as fendes doon in helle
The dokes cryden  as men wolde hem quelle
  
The gees for feere  flowen ouer the trees
Out of the hyue  cam the swarm of bees
So hydous was the noyse  a benedicite
Certes  he Iakke Straw  and his meynee
Ne made neuere showtes  half so shrille
Whan þat they wolden  any flemyng kille
As thilke day  was maad vpon the fox
Of bras  they broghten bemys  and of box
Of horn  of boon  in whiche they blewe and powped
And ther with al  they skryked and they howped
It semed  as þat heuene sholde falle
Now goode men  I prey yow herkneth alle
Lo  how ffortune  turneth sodeynly
The hope  and pryde eek of hire enemy
This cok þat lay vpon the foxes bak
In al his drede  vnto the fox he spak
And seyde sire  if þat I were as ye
Yit sholde I seyn  as wys god helpe me
Turneth ayein ye proude cherles alle
A verray pestilence  vpon yow falle
Now I am come  vnto this wodes syde
Maugree youre heed  the cok shal here abyde
I wol hym ete in feith  and that anon
 The fox answerde  in feith it shal be don
And  he spak that word  al sodeynly
This cok  brak from his mouth delyuerly
And hye vp on a tree  he fley anon  
 And whan the fox say  þat he was gon
Allas quod he  o Chauntecler Allas
I haue to yow quod he  ydon trespas
In as muche  as I maked yow aferd
Whan I yow hente  and broghte into this yerd
But sire  I dide it in no wikke entente
Com doun  and I shal telle yow what I mente
I shal seye sooth to yow  god help me so
 Nay thanne quod he  I shrewe vs bothe two
  
And first I shrewe my self  bothe blood and bones
If thow bigile me  any ofter than ones
Thow shalt namoore  thurgh thy flaterye
Do me to synge  and wynken with myn eye
ffor he þat wynketh  whan he sholde see
Al wilfully  god lat hym neuere thee
 Nay quod the fox  but god yeue hym meschance
That is  so vndiscret of gouernance
That Iangleth  whan he sholde holde his pees
 Lo swich it is  for to be recchelees
And necligent and truste on flaterye
But ye  þat holden this tale a folye
As of a fox  or of a cok and hen
Taketh the moralitee  goode men
ffor Seint Poul seith  þat al that writen is 
To oure doctryne  it is ywrite ywis
Taketh the fruyt and lat the chaf be stille
Now goode god  if þat it be thy wille
As seith my lord  so make vs alle goode men
And brynge vs  to his heye blisse Amen  
Woot ye nat where  ther stant a litel town
Which þat cleped is  Bobbe vp and down
Vnder the Blee  in Caunterbury weye
Ther gan oure hoost for to iape and pleye
And seyde sires  what  Don is in the Myre
Is ther no man  for preyere ne for Hyre
at wole awake  oure felawe al bihynde
A theef myghte hym  ful lightly robbe and bynde 
Se how he nappeth  se how for Cokkes bones
That he wol falle  from his hors atones
Is that a Cook of london  with meschance
Do hym come forth  he knoweth his penance
ffor he shal telle a tale  by my fey
Al thogh  it be nat worth a botel hey
Awake thow Cook quod he  god yeue thee sorwe
What eyleth thee  to slepe by the morwe
Hastow had fleen al nyght or artow dronke
Or hastow with som quene  al nyght yswonke
So  that thow mayst nat holden vp thyn heed
 This Cook þat was ful pale  and no thyng rede
Seyde to oure hoost so god my soule blesse
As ther is  falle  on me swich heuynesse
Noot I nat why  þat me were leuere slepe
Than the beste galon wyn in Chepe
  
 Wel quod the Manciple  if it may don ese
To thee sir Cook and to no wight displese
Which þat here rideth  in this compaignye
And þat oure hoost wole of his curteisye
I wole as now  excuse thee of thy tale
ffor in good feith  thy visage is ful pale
Thyne eyen daswen eek as þat me thynketh
And wel I woot thy breth ful soure stynketh
That sheweth wel  thow art nat wel disposed
Of me certeyn  thow shalt nat ben yglosed
Se how he ganeth  lo this dronken wight
As though he wolde  swolwe vs anon right
Hoold cloos thy mouth  man by thy fader kyn
The deuel of helle  sette his foot ther yn
Thy cursed breeth  infecte wol vs alle
ffy stynkynge swyn  fy  foule mote thee falle
A taketh hede sires  of this lusty man
Now swete sire  wol ye Iusten atte ffan
Therto me thynketh  ye ben wel yshape
I trowe  þat ye dronken han wyn Ape
And that is  whan men pleyen with a straw
And with his speche  the Cook wax wroth and wraw
And on the Manciple  bigan he nodde faste  
ffor lakke of speche  and doun the hors hym caste
Wher as he lay  til þat men vp hym took
This was  a fair chyuachee of a Cook
Allas  he nadde yholde hym  by his ladel
And er þat he  agayn were in his sadel
Ther was gret showuyng bothe to and fro
To lifte hym vp  and muchel care and wo
So vnweldy  was this sory palled goost
And to the Manciple  thanne spak oure hoost
 By cause  drynke hath domynacion
Vp on this man  by my sauacion
I trowe he lewedly  telle wolde his tale
ffor were it wyn  or old  or moisty Ale
  
That he hath dronke  he speketh in his nose
And fneseth faste  and eek he hath the pose
He hath also to do  moore than ynow
To kepen hym  and his capil  out of the Slow
And if he falle  from his capil eft soone
Than shal we alle  haue ynow to doone
In liftynge vp  his heuy dronken cors
Telle on thy tale  of hym make I no fors
But yet Manciple  in feith thow art to nyce
Thus openly  repreue hym of his vice
Another day  he wole par Auenture
Reclayme thee  and brynge thee to lure
I mene  he speke wole  of smale thynges
As for to pynchen  at thy rekenynges
That were nat honeste  if it cam to preef
 No quod the Manciple  that were a gret mescheef
So myghte he lightly  brynge me in the snare
Yet hadde I leuere  payen for the Mare
Which he rit on  than he sholde with me stryue
I wol nat wrathe hym  also mote I thryue
That þat I spak I seyde it in my bourde
And wite what I haue here in a gourde
A draughte of wyn  ye of a rype grape
And right anon  ye shul seen a good Iape
This Cook shal drynke ther of if I may
Vp peyne of deeth  he wol nat seye me nay
d certeynly  to tellen as it was
Of this vessel  the Cook drank faste  allas
What neded it he drank ynow biforn
And whan he hadde  powped in this horn
To the Manciple  he took the gourde agayn
And of that drynke  the Cook was wonder fayn
And thanked hym  in swich wise as he kowde
 Thanne gan oure hoost to laughen wonder lowde
And seyde  I se wel it is necessarie
Where þat we goon  good drynke we with vs carye
  
ffor that wol turne  rancour and disese
Tacord and loue  a many a wrong Appese
 O Bacus  yblessed be thy name
That so kanst turnen  ernest in to game
Worshipe and thank be to thy deitee
Of that matere  ye gete namoore for me
Telle on thy  Manciple  I the preye
Wel sir quod he  now herkneth what I seye

Whan Phebus  dwelled here  in this erthe adoun
As olde bokes  maken mencioun
He was  the mooste lusty bachiler
In al this world  and eek the beste Archer
He slow Phiton the serpent as he lay
Slepynge agayn the sonne vp on a day
And many another  noble worthy dede
He with his bowe wroghte  as men may rede
Pleyen he koude  on euery Mynstralcye
And syngen  þat it was a melodye
To heren  of his clere voys  the soun
Certes  the kyng of Thebes Amphioun
That with his syngyng walled that Citee
Koude neuere syngen  half so wel as he
Therto  he was the semelieste man
That is  or was  sith þat the world bigan
What nedeth it hise fetures to discryue
ffor in this world  was noon so fair on lyue
He was ther with  fulfild of gentillesse
Of honour  and of parfit worthynesse
 This Phebus  þat was flour of Bachelrye  
As wel  in fredom as in Chiualrye
ffor his desport in signe eek of Victorie
Of Phiton  so as telleth vs the storie
Was wont to beren  in his hand a bowe
Now hadde this Phebus  in his hous a Crowe
Which in a Cage  he fostred many a day
And taughte it speke  as men teche a Iay
  
Whit was this Crowe  as is a Snow whit Swan
And contrefete  the speche of euery man
He kowde  whan he sholde telle a tale
Therwith in al this world  no nyghtyngale
Ne koude  by an hondred thousand deel
Syngen  so wonder myrily and weel
 Now hadde this Phebus  in his hous a wyf
Which þat he louede  moore than his lyf
And nyght and day  dide euere his diligence
Hire for to plese  and doon hire reuerence
Saue oonly  that the sothe  if I shal sayn
Ialous he was  and wolde han kept hire fayn
ffor hym were looth  byiaped for to be
And so is euery wight in swich degree
But al for naught for it auaileth noght
A good wyf that is clene in werk and thoght
Sholde nat be kept in noon awayt certayn
And trewely  the labour is in vayn
To kepe a shrewe  for it wol nat be
This holde I  for a verray nycetee
To spille labour  for to kepe wyues
Thus writen olde clerkes in hir lyues
 But now to purpos  as I first bigan
This worthy Phebus  dooth al that he kan
To plesen hire  wenynge for swich plesance
And for his manhode  and his gouernance
That no man  sholde han put hym from hire grace
But god it woot ther may no man embrace
As to destreyne a thyng which þat nature
Hath naturelly  set in a creature
 Take any bryd  and put it in a Cage
And do al thyn entente  and thy corage
 fostre it tendrely  with mete and drynke
Of alle deyntees  þat thow kanst bithynke
And kepe it al so clenly as thow may
Al though his Cage  of gold  be neuer so gay
  
Yet hath this bryd  by xx thousand fold
Leuere in a fforest þat is rude and cold
Gon ete wormes  and swich wrecchednesse
ffor euere this bryd  wol doon his bisynesse
To eschape out of his Cage  if he may
His libertee  this bryd desireth ay
 Lat take a Cat and fostre hym wel with Milk
And tendre flessh  and make his couche of silk
And lat hym seen a Mous  go by the wal
Anon he weyueth  Milk  and flessh and al
And euery deyntee  þat is in that hous
Swich appetit hath he  to ete a Mous
Lo  heere hath lust his domynacion
And appetit flemeth discrecion
 A she wolf hath also  a vileyns kynde
The lewedeste wolf  þat she may fynde
And leest of reputacion  that wol she take
In tyme  whan hire lust to han a make
 Alle thise ensamples  speke I by thise men
That ben vntrewe  but no thyng by wommen
ffor men han euere  a likerous appetit
On lower thyng  to parformen hir delit
Than on hire wyues  be they neuer so faire
Ne neuer so trewe  ne so debonaire
fflessh is so newfangel  with meschance
That we ne konne  in no thyng han plesance
That sowneth in to vertu  any while
 This Phebus  which þat thoughte vp on no gile
Deceyued was  for al his iolitee
ffor vnder hym  another hadde she
A man  of litel reputacion
Nat worth to Phebus in comparison
The moore harm is  it happeth ofte so
Of which ther cometh  muchel harm and wo
And so bifel  whan Phebus was absent
His wyf anon  hath for hire lemman sent
  
Hir lemman  certes this a knauyssh speche  
fforyeueth it me  and that I yow biseche
The wise Plato seith  as ye may rede
The word moot nede  acorde with the dede
If men shal telle  proprely a thyng
The word  moot cosyn be to the werkyng
I am a boystous man  right thus seye I
Ther nys no difference  trewely
Bitwix a wyf þat is of heigh degree
If of hire body  deshoneste she be
And a poore wenche  oother than this
If it so be  they werke bothe amys
But þat the gentile  in estat aboue
She shal be clepid his lady  as in loue
And for that oother  is a poore womman
She shal be clepid  his wenche  or his lemman
And god it woot myn owene deere brother
Men leyn þat oon  as lowe as lyth that oother
 Right so  bitwix a titlelees tirant
And an Outlawe  or a theef errant
The same I seye  ther is no difference
To Alisandre  was told this sentence
That for the tirant  is of gretter myght
By force of meyne  for to sleen doun right
And brennen hous and hoom  and make al playn
Lo  ther fore  is he clepid a Capitayn
And for the Outlawe  hath but smal meynee
And may nat doon  so gret an harm as he
Ne brynge a contree  to so gret meschief
Men clepen hym  an Outlawe or a theef
But for I am a man  noght textuel
I wol noght telle of textes  neuer a del
I wol go to my tale  as I bigan
 Whan Phebus wyf hadde sent for hire lemman
Anon they wroghte  al hire lust volage
The white Crowe  þat heng ay in the Cage
  
Biheld hir werk and seyde neuer a word
And whan that hoom was come  Phebus the lord
This Crowe sang Cokkow  Cokkow Cokkow
 What bryd quod Phebus  what song syngestow
e were thow wont so myrily to synge
That to myn herte  it was a reioysynge
To here thy voys  allas what song is this
 By god quod he  I synge nat amys
Phebus quod he  for al thy worthynesse
ffor al thy beautee  and thy gentillesse
ffor al thy song and al thy Mynstralcye
ffor al thy waityng blered is thyn eye
With oon  of litel reputacion
Nat worth to thee  in comparison
The montance of a gnat so mote I thryue
ffor in thy bed  thy wif I sey hym andcetera
What wol ye moore  the Crowe anon hym tolde
By sadde toknes  and by wordes bolde
How þat his wyf  hadde doon hire lecherye
Hym to gret shame  and to gret vileynye
And tolde hym  ofte he say it with hise eyen
 This Phebus  gan aweyward for to wryen
And thoughte  his sorweful herte brast atwo
His bowe he bente  and sette therInne a flo
And in his Ire  his wyf thanne hath he slayn
This is theffect ther nys namoore to sayn
ffor sorwe of which  he brak his Mynstralcye
Bothe harpe  and Lute  and Gyterne  and Sawtrye
And eek he brak his arwes  and his bowe
And after that thus spak he to the Crowe
 Traytour quod he  with tonge of Scorpion
Thow hast me broght to my confusion
Allas þat I was wroght why nere I ded
O deere wyf O gemme of lustihed
That were to me  so sad  and eek so trewe
Now lystow ded  with face pale of hewe
  
fful giltlees  that dorste I swere ywys
O rakel hand  to doon so foule amys
O trouble wit o Ire recchelees
That vnauysed  smytest giltlees
O wantrust ful of fals suspecion
Where was thy wit and thy discrecion
O euery man  be war of rakelnesse
Ne trowe ye no thyng with outen strong witnesse
Smyt nat to soone  er þat ye witen why  
And beth auysed  wel and sobrely
Er ye do  any execucion
Vp on youre Ire  for suspecion
 Allas  a thousand folk hath rakel Ire
ffully fordoon  or broght hem in the Myre
Allas  for sorwe  I wol my seluen sle
 And to the Crowe  o false theef seyde he
I wol thee quyte anon  thy false tale
Thow songe whilom  lyk a nyghtyngale
Now shaltow false theef thy song forgon
And eek thy white fetheres euerichon
Ne neuere in al thy lyf ne shaltow speke
Thus shal men  on a traytour ben awreke
Thow and thyn offspryng euere shul be blake
Ne neuere  swete noyse shul ye make
But euere crye  agayn tempest and rayn
In tokenynge  þat thurgh thee my wyf is slayn
And to the Crowe he stirte  and that anon
And pulled  hise white fetheres euerichon
And made hym blak and refte hym al his song
And eek his speche  and out at dore hym slong
Vn to the deuel  which I hym bitake
And for this cas  ben alle Crowes blake
 Lordynges  by this ensample  I yow preye
Beth war  and taketh kepe what I seye
Ne telleth neuere  no man in youre lyf
How þat another man  hath dight his wyf
  
He wol yow haten  mortally certeyn
 Daun Salomon  as wise clerkes seyn
Techeth a man  to kepen his tonge wel
But as I seyde  I nam nat textuel
But nathelecs  thus taughte me my Dame
My sone  thenk on the Crowe a goddes name
My sone  keep wel thy tonge  and kepe thy freend
A wikke tonge  is worse than a feend
My sone  from a feend  men may hem blesse
My sone  god  of his endelees goodnesse
Walled a tonge  with teeth  and lippes eke
ffor man sholde hym auyse  what he speeke
one  ful ofte  for to muche speche
ath many a man ben spilt as clerkes teche
But for litel speche  auysely
Is no man shent to speke generally
My sone  thy tonge  sholdestow restreyne
At alle tymes  but whan thow doost thy peyne
To speke of god  in honour and prayere
The firste vertu sone  if thow wolt leere
Is to restreyne  and kepe wel thy tonge
Thus lernen children  whan þat they ben yonge
My sone  of muchel spekyng yuele auysed
Ther lasse spekyng hadde ynow suffised
Comth muchel harm  thus was me told and taught
In muchel speche  synne wanteth naught
Wostow wher of a rakel tonge serueth
Right as a swerd  forkitteth and forkerueth
An arm atwo  my deere sone right so
A tonge  kitteth frendship al atwo
A Ianglere  is to god abhomynable

My sone  spek noght but with thyn hed thow bekke
Dissimule as thow were deef if þat thow heere
A Ianglere speke  of perilous matere

That litel Ianglyng causeth muchel reste
My sone  if thow  no wikked word hast seyd
Thee thar nat drede  for to be biwreyd
But he þat hath mysseyd  I dar wel sayn
He may by no wey  clepe his word agayn
Thyng that is sayd  is seyd  and forth it gooth
Though hym repente  or be hym leef or looth
He is his thral  to whom þat he hath sayd
A tale  of which he is now yuele apayd
My sone be war  and be noon Auctour newe
Of tidynges  wher they ben false  or trewe
Wher so thow come  amonges heye  or lowe
Kepe wel thy tonge  and thynk vp on the Crowe  
Ovre hoost saw wel  that the brighte sonne  
The ark of his artificial day hath ronne
The ferthe part and half an hour and moore
And thogh he were nat depe ystert in loore
He wiste  it was the xviijthe day
Of April  that is messager to May
And saw wel  þat the shadwe of euery tree
Was as in lengthe  the same quantitee
That was the body erect that caused it
And therfore by the shadwe  he took his wit
That Phebus  which þat shoon so cleer and brighte
Degrees was xlv clombe on highte
And for that day  as in that latitude
It was ten at the Clokke  he gan conclude
And sodeynly  he plighte his hors aboute
 Lordynges quod he  I warne yow al this route
The ferthe party  of this day is goon
Now for the loue of god  and of Seint Iohn
Leseth no tyme  as ferforth as ye may
Lordynges the tyme  it wasteth nyght and day
And steleth from vs  what pryuely slepynge
And what thurgh necligence  in oure wakynge
As dooth the streem  þat turneth neuere agayn
Descendynge  fro the montaigne in to playn
Wel kan Senec and many a Philosophre
Biwaillen tyme  moore than gold in cofre

But los of tyme  shendeth vs quod he
  
It wol nat come agayn  with outen drede
Namoore  than wol Malkyns maydenhede
Whan she hath lost it  in hir wantownesse
Lat vs nat mowlen thus in ydelnesse
 Sire man of lawe quod he  so haue ye blys
Tel vs a tale anon  as forward is

To stonden in this cas  at my Iuggement

Thanne haue ye doon youre deuoir atte leeste

To breken forward  is nat myn entente

Al my biheste  I kan no bettre sayn
ffor swich lawe  as a man yeueth another wight
He sholde hym self  vsen it by right
Thus wol oure text  but nathelees certein
I kan right now  no thrifty tale seyn
That Chaucer  thogh he kan but lewedly
On metres  and on rymyng craftily
Hath seyd hem  in swich englissh as he kan
Of olde tyme  as knoweth many a man
And if he ne haue nat seyd hem  leeue brother
In o book he hath seyd hem in another
ffor he hath toold  of louers vp and doun
Mo than Ouide  made of mencioun
In his epistles  þat been ful olde
What sholde I tellen hem  syn they been tolde
In yowthe he made  of Ceys and Alcione
And sithen  hath he spoke of euerychone
Thise noble wyues  and thise loueres eke
Who so þat wole  his large volum seke
Clepyd  the Seintes legende of Cupide
Ther maystow seen  the large woundes wyde
Of Lucresse  and of Babilan Tisbee
The swerd of Dido  for the false Enee
  
The tree of Phillis  for hir Demophon
The pleinte of Dianire  and of hermyon
Of Adriane  and of ysiphilee
The barayne Ile  stondynge in the See
The dreynte leandre  for his Erro
The terys of Eleyne  and eke the wo
Of Brixseyde  and of the Ladomea
The crueltee  of the queene Medea
The litel children  hangyng by the hals
ffor thy Iason  that was of loue so fals
O Ypermystra  Penolopee  Alceste
Youre wifhod  he comendeth with the beste
But certeinly  no word ne writeth he  
Of thilke wikke ensample  of Canacee
That loued  hir owene brother synfully
Of swiche cursed stories  I sey fy
Or ellis  of Tyro Appollonius
How þat  the cursed kyng Antiochus
Birafte his doghter  of hir maydenhede
That is  so horrible a tale for to rede
When he hir threw  vp on the pauement
And ther fore  he of ful auisement
Nolde neuere write  in noon of his sermons
Of swiche  vnkynde abhominacions
Ne I wol noon reherce  if þat I may
But of my tale  how shal I doon this day
Me were looth  be likned doutelees
To Muses  þat been clepyd Pierides
Methamorphosios  woot what I mene
But nathelees  I recche noght a bene
Thogh I come after hym  with hawe bake
I speke in prose  and lat hym rymes make
And with that word  he with a sobre cheere
Bigan his tale  as ye shal after heere
O hateful harm  condicion of pouerte
With thurst with cold  with hunger so confoundid
To axen help  thee shameth in thyn herte
If thou noon axe  with nede artow so woundid
That verray nede  vnwrappeth al thy wounde hid
Maugree thyn heed  thou most for Indigence
Or stele  or begge  or borwe thy despence
Thow blamest Crist and seist ful bitterly
He mysdeparteth  richesse temporal
Thy neghebore  thow witest synfully
And seist thow hast to lite  and he hath al
Parfay seistow  som tyme he rekne shal
Whan þat his tayl  shal brennen in the gleede
ffor he noght helpeth  nedefulle in hir nede
rke  what is the sentence of the wise
Bet is to dyen  than haue Indigence
Thy selue neghebor  wol thee despise
If thow be pouere  fare wel thy reuerence
Yet of the wise man  tak this sentence
Alle the dayes  of pouere men been wikke
Be war ther fore  er thow come to that prikke
 If thou be pouere  thy brother hateth thee
And alle thy freendes  fleen from thee allas
O riche Marchauntz  ful of wele been ye
O noble  O prudent folk  as in this cas
Youre bagges  been noght filled with ambes as
But with sys cynk that renneth for youre chaunce
At Cristemasse  murye may ye daunce
  
Ye seken lond and see  for youre wynnynges
As wise folk ye knowen al thestat
Of regnes  ye been fadres of tidynges
And tales  bothe of pees and of debat
I were right now  of tales desolat
Nere þat a Marchaunt  goon is many a yere
Me taughte a tale  which þat ye shal heere

 In Surrye whilom  dwelte a compaignye
Of chapmen riche  and therto sadde and trewe
That wyde where  senten hir spicerye
Clothes of gold  and Satyns riche of hewe
Hir cheffare  was so thrifty and so newe
That euery wight hath deyntee to cheffare
With hem  and eek to sellen hem hir ware
 Now fil it  that the maistres of that sort
Han shapen hem  to Rome for to wende
Were it for chaphod  or for desport
Noon oother message  wolde they thider sende
But coomen hem self to Rome  this is the ende
And in swich place  as thoughte hem auauntage
ffor hir entente  they take hir herbergage
 Soiourned han thise Marchauntz  in that town  
A certein tyme  as fil to hir plesaunce
But so bifel  þat the excellent renoun
Of the Emperours doghter  dame Custaunce
Reported was  with euery circumstaunce
Vn to thise Surryen Marchauntz  in swich wise
ffro day  to day  as I shal yow deuyse
 This was the commune voys  of euery man
Oure Emperour of Rome  god hym se
A doghter hath  þat syn the world bigan
To rekne as wel  hir goodnesse as beautee
Nas neuere swich another  as is she
I pray to god  in honour hir sustene
And wolde she were  of al Europe the queene  
 In hire is heigh beautee  with oute pryde
Youthe  with outen grenehede  or folye
To alle hir werkes  vertu is hir gyde
Humblesse  hath slayn in hire al tirannye
She is Mirour  of al curteisye
Hir herte  is verray chambre of holynesse
Hir hand Ministre  of fredam  for almesse
 And al this voys was sooth  as god is trewe
But now to purpos  lat vs come agayn
Thise Marchauntz  han doon fraught hir shippes newe
And whan they han  this blisful mayden sayn
Hom to Surrye  been they went ful fayn
And doon hir nedes  as they han doon yoore
And lyuen in wele  I kan sey yow namoore
 Now fil it that thise Marchauntz stode in grace
Of hym  that was the Sowdan of Surrye
ffor whan they coome  from any straunge place
He wolde  of his benygne curteisye
Maken hem good cheere  and bisily espye
Tidynges  of sondry regnes for to leere
The wondres  that they myghte seen or heere
 onges othere thynges specially  
Thise Marchauntz han hym told  of dame Custaunce
So greet noblesse  in ernest ceriously
That this Sowdan  hath caught so greet plesaunce
To han hir figure  in his remembraunce
That al his lust  and al his bisy cure
Was for to loue hire  whil his lyf may dure
 Parauenture  in thilke large book
Which þat men clepe the heuene  ywriten was
With sterres  whan þat he his birthe took
That he for loue  sholde han his deth allas
  
ffor in the sterres  clerer than is glas
Is writen god woot who so koude it rede
The deeth of euery man  with outen drede
 In sterres  many a wynter  ther biforn
Ceptra phoronei  fratrum discordia Thebe
fflammam Phetontis Decalionis aque
In stellis Priami species audacia Turni
Sensus vlixeus  herculeusque vigor
Was writen the deeth  of Ector  Achilles
Of Pompei  Iulius  er they were born
The stryf of Thebes  and of Hercules
Of Sampson  Turnus  and of Socrates
The deeth  but mennes wittes been so dulle
That no wight kan wel rede it atte fulle
 This Sowdan  for his priuee conseil sente
And shortly  of this matere for to pace
He hath to hem  declared his entente
And seyde hem certein  but he myghte haue grace
To han Custaunce  with Inne a litel space
He nas but deed  and charged hem in hye
To shapen  for his lyf som remedye
 Diuerse men  diuerse thynges seyden
They argumenten  casten vp and doun
Many a subtil reson  forth they leyden
They speken of Magyk  and Abusioun
But finally  as in conclusioun
They kan nat seen  in that noon Auauntage
Ne in noon oother wey  saue mariage
 Thanne sawe they ther Inne  swich difficultee  
By wey of reson  for to speke al playn
By cause  þat ther was swich diuersitee
Bitwene hir bothe lawes  þat they sayn
They trowe  þat no cristen Prince wolde fayn
Wedden his child  vnder oure lawes swete
That vs was taught by Mahoun oure prophete
  
 And he answerde  rather than I lese
Custaunce  I wol be cristned doutelees
I moot ben hires  I may noon oother chese
I pray yow  hold youre argumentz in pees
Saueth my lyf  and beth noght recchelees
To geten hire  þat hath my lyf in cure
ffor in this wo  I may nat longe endure
 What nedeth  gretter dilatacion
I seye  by tretys  and embassadrye
And by the Popes mediacion
And al the chirche  and al the chiualrie
That in destruccion of Mawmetrie
And in encrees  of Cristes lawe deere
They been acorded  so as ye shal heere
 How þat the Sowdan  and his Baronage
And alle his liges  sholde ycristned be
And he shal han  Custaunce in mariage
And certeyn gold  I noot what quantitee
And heer to  founden sufficient seuretee
This same acord  was sworn on either syde
Now faire Custaunce  al myghty god thee gyde
 Now wolde som men  waiten as I gesse
That I sholde tellen  al the purueiaunce
That Themperour  of his grete noblesse
Hath shapen for his doghter  dame Custaunce
Wel may men knowen  þat so greet ordinaunce
May no man tellen  in a litel clause
As was arrayed  for so heigh a cause
shopes been shapen  with hire for to wende  
Lordes  ladies  knyghtes of renoun
And oother folk ynowe  this is thende
And notified is  thurgh out the town
  
That euery wight with greet deuocioun
Sholde preyen crist þat he this mariage
Receyue in gree  and spede this viage
 The day is comen  of hir departynge
I seye  the woful day fatal  is come
That ther may be  no lenger taryynge
But forthward they hem dresse  alle and some
Custaunce  that was with sorwe all ouercome
fful pale arist and dresseth hire to wende
ffor wel she seeth  ther nys noon oother ende
 Allas  what wonder is it thogh she wepte
That shal be sent to straunge nacion
ffro freendes  þat so tendrely hir kepte
And to be bounden  vndur subieccion
Of oon  she knoweth noght his condicion
Housbondes been alle goode  and han been yoore
That knowen wyues  I dar sey yow namoore
 ffader she seyde  thy wrecched child Custaunce
Thy yonge doghter  fostred vp so softe
And ye my moder  my souereyn plesaunce
Ouer alle thyng  outtaken crist on lofte
Custaunce youre child  hir recomaundeth ofte
Vn to your grace  for I shal to Surrye
Ne shal I neuere  seen yow moore with eye
 Allas  vn to the Barbre nacion
I moste anon  syn þat it is youre wille
But crist that starf for oure redempcion
So yeue me grace  hise hestes to fulfille
I wrecche womman  no fors thogh I spille
Wommen are born  to thraldom and penaunce
And to been  vnder mannes gouernaunce
  
 I trowe at Troye  whan Pirrus brak the wal  
Or Ylion  brent hadde Thebes the Citee
Nat Rome  for the harm thurgh Hanybal
That Romayns  hath venquysshed tymes thre
Nas herd  swich tendre wepyng for pitee
As in the chambre was  for hir departynge
But forth she moot wher so she wepe or synge
 O firste moeuer  cruel firmament
With thy diurnal sweigh  þat crowdest ay
And hurlest al  fro Est  til Occident
That naturelly  wolde holde another way
Thy crowdyng  set the heuene in swich array
At bigynnyng of this fiers viage
That cruel Mars  hath slayn this mariage
 Infortunat ascendent tortuous
Of which the lord  is helplees falle allas
Out of his angle  in to the derkest hous
O Mars  o Atazir  as in this cas
O fieble Moone  vnhappy been thy pas
Thow knyttest thee  ther thow nart nat receyued
Ther thow were wel  fro thennes artow weyued
 Inprudent Emperour of Rome  allas
Was ther no Philosophre  in al thy town
Is no tyme bet than oother  in swich cas
Of viage  is ther noon eleccioun
Namely  to folk of heigh condicioun
Nat whan a roote  is of a burthe yknowe
Allas  we been  to lewed or to slowe
 To shipe is broght this woful faire mayde
Solempnely  with euery circumstaunce
Now Ihesu crist be with yow alle  she seyde
Ther nys namoore  but fare wel faire Custaunce
  
She peyneth hire  to make good contenaunce
And forth I lete hir Sayle  in this manere
And turne I wole  agayn to my matere
 he moder of the Sowdan  welle of vices  
Espied hath  hir sones pleyn entente
How he wol lete  his olde sacrifices
And right anon  she for hir conseil sente
And they ben come  to knowen what she mente
And whan assembled was  this folk in feere
She sette hir down  and seyde as ye shal heere
 Lordes quod she  ye knowen euerychon
How þat my sone  in point is for to lete
The holy lawes  of oure Alkaron
Yeuen by goddes message Makomete
But oon avow  to grete god I hete
The lyf shal rather  out of my body sterte
Than Makometes lawe  out of myn herte
 What sholde vs tiden  of this newe lawe
But thraldom to oure bodies  and penaunce
And afterward  in helle to be drawe
ffor we reneyed  Mahoun oure creaunce
But lordes  wol ye maken assuraunce
As I shal seyn  assentyng to my loore
And I shal make vs sauf  for euere moore
 They sworen  and assenten euery man
To lyue with hire and dye  and by hir stonde
And euerich  in the beste wise he kan
To strengthen hire  shal alle hise freendes fonde
And she hath  this emprise ytake on honde
Which ye shal heren  þat I shal deuyse
And to hem alle  she spak right in this wise
  
 We shul first feyne vs  cristendom to take
Coold water  shal nat greue vs but a lite
And I shal  swich a feste  and reuel make
That as I trowe  I shal the Sowdan quyte
ffor thogh his wyf  be cristned neuer so whyte
She shal haue nede  to wasshe awey the rede
Thogh she  a font ful water with hir lede
 O Sowdanesse roote of Iniquitee  
Virago  thow Semyrame the secounde
O Serpent vnder femynynytee
Lyk to the Serpent depe in helle ybounde
O feyned womman  al that may confounde
Vertu and Innocence  thurgh thy malice
Is bred in thee  as nest of euery vice
 O Sathan enuyous  syn thilke day
That thow were chaced  from oure heritage
Wel knowestow to wommen  the olde way
Thow madest Eua  brynge vs in seruage
Thow wolt fordoon  this cristen mariage
Thyn Instrument so weylawey the while
Makestow of wommen  whan thou wolt bigile
 This Sowdanesse  whom I thus blame and warye
Leet pryuely hir conseil  goon his way
What sholde I in this tale  lenger tarye
She rideth to the Sowdan  on a day
And seyde hym  þat she wolde reneye hir lay
And cristendom  of preestes handes fonge
Repentynge hire  she hethen was so longe
 Bisekyng hym  to doon hire that honour
That she moste han  the cristen folk to feste
To plesen hem  I shall do my labour
The Sowdan seith  I wol doon at youre heste
  
And knelynge  thanketh hire of that requeste
So glad he was  he nyste what to seye
She kiste hir sone  and hom she gooth hir weye
 Arryued been this cristen folk to londe
In Surrye  with a gret solempne route
And hastily  this Sowdan sente his sonde
ffirst to his moder  and al the regne aboute
And seyde his wyf  was comen out of doute
And preyde hire  for to ryde agayn the queene
The honour  of his regne to sustene
 Greet was the prees  and riche was tharray  
Of Surryens  and Romayns met yfeere
The moder of the Sowdan  riche and gay
Receyueth hire  with also glad a cheere
As any moder  myghte hir doghter deere
And to the nexte Citee  ther bisyde
A softe paas  solempnely they ryde
 Naught trowe I  the triumphe of Iulius
Of which þat lucan  maketh swich a boost
Was roiallour  ne moore curyus
Than was the assemblee  of this blisful oost
But this scorpion  this wikked goost
The Sowdanesse  for al hir flaterynge
Caste vnder this  ful mortally to stynge
 The Sowdan cometh hym self  soone after this
So roially  þat wonder is to telle
He welcometh hire  with alle ioye and blys
And thus in myrthe and Ioye  I lete hem dwelle
  
The fruyt of this matere  is þat I telle
Whan tyme cam  men thoughte it for the beste
That reuel stynte  and men go to hir reste
 The tyme cam  this olde Sowdanesse
Ordeyned hath this feste  of which I tolde
And to the feste  cristen folk hem dresse
In general  ye bothe yonge and olde
Heer may men feste  and roialtee biholde
And deyntees mo  than I kan yow deuyse
But al to deere  they boghte it er they ryse
 O sodeyn wo  that euere art Successour
To worldly blisse  spreynd with bitternesse
The ende of the ioye  of oure worldly labour
Wo ocupieth  the fyn of oure gladnesse
Herke this conseil  for thy sikernesse
Vp on thy glade day  haue in thy mynde
The vnwar wo  or harm  þat comth bihynde
 ffor shortly  for to tellen  at a word  
The Sowdan  and the cristen euerychone
Been al tohewe  and stiked at the bord
But it were oonly  dame Custaunce allone
This olde sowdanesse  cursed krone
Hath with hir freendes  doon this cursed dede
ffor she hir self  wolde al the contree lede
 Ne ther nas Surryen noon  þat was conuerted
That of the conseil  of the Sowdan woot
That he nas al tohewe  er he asterted
And Custaunce  han they take anon foot hoot
And in a ship  al sterelees  god woot
They han hir set and bidde hir lerne Sayle
Out of Surrye  agaynward to Itaille
  
 A certein tresor  that she thider ladde
And sooth to seyn  vitaille gret plentee
They han hir yeuen  and clothes eek she hadde
And forth she sayleth  in the salte see
O my Custaunce  ful of benygnytee
O Emperours  yonge doghter deere
He þat is lord of ffortune be thy steere
 She blisseth hire  and with ful pitous voys
Vn to the cros of Crist thus seyde she
O clere  o weleful Auter  holy croys
Reed of the lambes blood  ful of pitee
That wesshe the world  fro the olde Iniquitee
Me fro the feend  and fro his clawes kepe
That day  þat I shal drenchen in the depe
 Victorious tree  proteccion of trewe
That oonly  worthy were for to bere
The kyng of heuene  with his woundes newe
The white lamb  that hurt was with a spere
fflemere of feendes  out of hym and here
On which thy lymes  feithfully extenden
Me kepe  and yeue me myght my lyf tamenden
res and dayes  fleet this creature  
Thurgh out the see of Grece  vn to the Strayte
Of Marrok as it was hir auenture
O many a sory meel  now may she bayte
After hir deth  ful often may she wayte
Er þat the wilde wawes  wol hir dryue
Vn to the place  ther she shal arryue
Men myghten axen  why she was noght slayn
Eek at the feste  who myghte hir body saue
And I answere  to that demaunde agayn
Who saued Danyel  in the horrible Caue
  
Ther euery wight saue he  maister and knaue
Was with the leon frete  er he asterte
No wight but god  þat he bar in his herte
 God liste to shewe  his wonderful miracle
In hire  for we sholde seen  his myghty werkes
Crist which þat is  to euery harm triacle
By certein menes ofte  as knowen clerkes
Dooth thyng for certein ende  þat ful derk is
To mannes wit þat for oure ignoraunce
Ne konne noght knowe  his prudent purueiaunce
 Now sith she was nat  at the feste yslawe
Who kepte hire  fro the drenchyng in the see
Who kepte Ionas  in the fisshes mawe
Til he  was spowted vp at Nynyuee
Wel may men knowe  it was no wight but hee
That kepte peple Ebrayk  from hir drenchyng
With drye feet thurgh out the see passyng
 Who bad  the foure Spiritz of tempest
That power han  tanoyen lond and See
Bothe North and South  and also west and Est
Anoyeth neither  See  ne land  ne tree
Soothly  the comaundour of that was hee
That fro the tempest ay this womman kepte
As wel  whan she wook as whan she slepte
 Wher myghte this womman  mete and drynke haue  
Thre yeer and moore  how lasteth hir vitaille
Who fedde the Egipcien Marie  in the Caue
Or in desert  no wight but crist sanz faille
ffyue thousand folk  it was as greet meruaille
With loues fyue  and fisshes two to fede
God sente his foyson  at hir grete nede
  
 She dryueth forth  in to oure Occian
Thurgh out the wilde see  til at the laste
Vnder an hoold  þat nempnen I ne kan
ffer in Northumberland  the wawe hir caste
And in the sond  hir shipe stiked so faste
That thennes wolde it noght of al a tyde
The wyl of crist was þat she sholde abyde
 The Constable of the Castel  down is fare
To seen this wrak and al the shipe he soghte
And foond this wery womman ful of care
He foond also  the tresor þat she broghte
In hir langage  mercy she bisoghte
The lyf  out of hir body for to twynne
Hir to deliuere  of wo that she was Inne
 A manere latyn corrupt was hir speche
But algates  ther by was she vnderstonde
The Constable  whan hym liste no lenger seche
This woful womman  broghte he to the londe
She kneleth doun  and thanketh goddes sonde
But what she was  she wolde no man seye
ffor foul ne fair  thogh þat she sholde deye
 She seyde  she was so mazed in the See
That she forgat hir mynde  by hir trouthe
The Constable  hath of hire so greet pitee
And eek his wyf  that they wepten for routhe
She was so diligent with outen slouthe
To serue and plese  euerich in that place
That alle hir louen  that looken on hir face
This Constable  and dame Hermengyld his wyf  
Were payens  and that contree euery where
But hermengyld  loued hire right as hir lyf
And Custaunce  hath so longe soiourned there
  
In orisons  with many a bitter teere
Til Ihesu  hath conuerted thurgh his grace
Dame hermengyld  Constablesse of thilke place
 In al that land  no cristen dorste route
Alle cristen folk  been fled fro that contree
Thurgh Payens  þat conquereden al aboute
The plages of the North  by land and see
To Walys  fledde the cristianytee
Of olde Britons  dwellyng in this Ile
Ther was hir refut for the mene while
 But yet nere cristen Britons  so exiled
That ther nere somme  þat in hir pryuetee
Honoured crist and hethen folk bigiled
And neigh the Castel  swiche ther dwelten thre
That oon of hem  was blynd and myghte nat se
But it were  with thilke eyen of his mynde
With whiche men seen  after þat they been blynde
 Bright was the sonne  as in that Someres day
ffor which the Constable  and his wyf also
And Custaunce  han ytake the righte way
Toward the see  a furlong wey  or two
To pleyen  and to romen to and fro
And in hir walk this blynde man they mette
Croked and old  with eyen faste yshette
 In name of Crist cryde this blynde Britoun
Dame Hermengyld  yif me my sighte agayn
This lady  weex affrayed of the sown
Lest þat hir housbonde  shortly for to sayn
Wolde hire  for Ihesu cristes loue han slayn
Til Custaunce made hir boold  and bad hir wirche
The wyl of Crist as doghter of his chirche
  
 The Constable  weex abasshed of that sight  
And seide  What amounteth al this fare
Custaunce answerde  sire it is Cristes myght
That helpeth folk  out of the feendes snare
And so ferforth  she gan oure lay declare
That she the Constable  er þat it was eue
Conuerteth  and on Crist made hym bileue
 This Constable  was no thyng lord of this place
Of which I speek ther he Custaunce fond
But kepte it strongly  many wynter space
Vnder Alla  kyng of al Northumberlond
That was ful wys  and worthy of his hond
Agayn the Scottes  as men may wel heere
But turne I wole  agayn to my matere
 Sathan  þat euere vs waiteth to bigile
Saugh of Custaunce  al hir perfeccion
And caste anon  how he myghte quite hir while
And made a yong knyght þat dwelte in that town
Loue hire hote  of foul affeccioun
That verraily  hym thoughte he sholde spille
But he of hire  myghte ones haue his wille
 He woweth hire  but it auailleth noght
She wolde do no synne  by no weye
And for despit he compassed in his thoght
To maken hire  on shameful deeth to deye
He wayteth  whan the Constable was aweye
And priuely  vp on a nyght he crepte
In Hermengildes chambre  whil she slepte
 Wery forwaked  in hir orisons
Slepeth Custaunce  and hermengild also
This knyght thurgh Sathans temptacions
Al softely  is to the bed ygo
  
And kitte the throte  of Hermengild atwo
And leyde the blody knyf  by dame Custaunce
And wente his wey  ther god yeue hym meschaunce
one after  cometh this Constable hom agayn  
And eek Alla  that kyng was of that lond
And saw his wyf  despitously yslayn
ffor which ful ofte  he weepe and wrong his hond
And in the bed  the blody knyf he fond
By dame Custaunce  allas what myghte she seye
ffor verray wo  hir wit was al aweye
 To kyng Alla  was told al this meschaunce
And eek the tyme  and where  and in what wise
That in a shipe  was founde this Custaunce
As her biforn  þat ye han herd deuyse
The kynges herte  of pitee gan agryse
Whan he saw  so benygne a creature
ffalle in disese  and in mysauenture
 ffor as the lomb  toward his deeth is broght
So stant this Innocent bifore the kyng
This false knyght þat hath this treson wroght
Bereth hire on hond  þat she hath doon this thyng
But nathelees  ther was greet moornyng
Among the peple  and seyn they kan nat gesse
That she had doon  so greet a wikkednesse
 ffor they han seyn hire  euere so vertuous
And louyng Hermengild  right as hir lyf
Of this baar witnesse  euerich in that hous
Saue he þat Hermengild  slow with his knyf
This gentil kyng hath caught a gret motyf
Of this witnesse  and thoghte he wolde enquere
Depper in this  a trouthe for to lere
  
 Allas Custaunce  thow nast no champion
Ne fighte kanstow noght so weilawey
But he þat starf  for oure redempcion
And bond Sathan  and yet lyth ther he lay
So be thy stronge champion this day
ffor but if Crist  open miracle kythe
With outen gilt thow shalt been slayn as swythe
 She sette hir down on knees  and thus she sayde  
Immortal god  that sauedest Susanne
ffro fals blame  and thow merciful mayde
Marie I mene  doghter to Seint Anne
Biforn whos child  Aungels synge Osanne
If I be giltlees  of this felonye
My socour be  for ellis shal I dye
 Haue ye nat seyn som tyme  a pale face
Among a prees  of hym þat hath be lad
Toward his deeth  wher as hym gat no grace
And swich a colour  in his face hath had
Men myghte knowe his face  þat was bistad
Amonges alle the faces  in that route
So stant Custance  and looketh hire aboute
 O Queenes  lyuynge in prosperitee
Duchesses  and ye ladies euerichon
Haueth som reuthe  on hir aduersitee
An Emperours doghter  stant allone
She hath no wight  to whom to make hir mone
O blood roial  that stondest in this drede
ffer be thy freendes  at thy grete nede
 This Alla kyng hath swich compassioun
As gentil herte  is fulfild of pitee
That from his eyen  ran the water doun
Now hastily  do fecche a book  quod he
  
And if this knyght wol sweren how þat she
This womman slow  yet wol we vs auyse
Whom þat we wole  that shal been oure Iustise
A Briton book writen with Euaungiles
Was fet and on this book he swoor anon
She gilty was  and in the mene whiles
An hand hym smoot vp on the nekke bon
That doun he fel  atones  as a stoon
And bothe hise eyen  broste out of his face
In sighte  of euery body in that place
ys was herd  in general audience  
And seyde  thow hast disclaundred giltlees
The doghter of holy chirche  in heigh presence
Thus hastow doon  and yet I holde my pees
Of this meruaille  agast was al the prees
As mazed folk  they stoden euerychone
ffor drede of wreche  saue Custance allone
 Greet was the drede  and eek the repentaunce
Of hem  þat hadden wrong suspecion
Vp on  this sely Innocent Custaunce
And for this miracle  in conclusion
And by Custaunces mediacion
The kyng and many another in that place
Conuerted was  thanked be Cristes grace
 This false knyght was slayn for his vntrouthe
By Iuggement of Alla hastily
And yet Custaunce  hadde of his deeth greet routhe
And after this  Ihesus of his mercy
Made Alla  wedden ful solempnely
This holy mayden  þat is so bright and shene
And thus hath Crist maad Custance a queene
  
 But who was woful  if I shal nat lye
Of this weddyng but Donegild and namo
The kynges moder  ful of tirannye
Hir thoughte  hir cursed herte brast atwo
She wolde noght hir sone had doon so
Hir thoughte a despit þat he sholde take
So straunge a creature  vn to his make
 Me list nat of the chaf  ne of the stree
Maken so long a tale  as of the corn
What sholde I tellen  of the realtee
At mariages  or which cours gooth biforn
Who bloweth in trompe  or in an horn
The fruyt of euery tale  is for to seye
They ete and drynke  and daunce  and synge and pleye
 They goon to bedde as it was skile and right  
ffor though þat wyues  been ful holy thynges
They moste take  in pacience at nyght
Swich manere necessaries  as been plesynges
To folk  that han ywedded hem with rynges
And laye a lite  hir holynesse asyde
As for the tyme  it may noon oother bityde
 On hire  he gat a knaue child anon
And to a bisshope  and his Constable eke
He took his wyf to kepe  whan he is gon
To Scotlondward  his foomen for to seke
Now faire Custaunce  þat is so humble and meke
So longe is goon with childe  til þat stille
She halt hir chambre  abidyng cristes wille
 The tyme is come  a knaue child she beer
Mauricius at the font stoon  they hym calle
This Constable  dooth forth come a Messager
And wroot vn to his kyng þat clepyd was Alle
  
How þat  this blisful tidynge is bifalle
And othere tidynges  speedful for to seye
He tath the lettre  and forth he goth his weye
 This Messager  to doon his auauntage
Vn to the kynges moder  rideth swithe
And salueth ful faire  in his langage
Ma dame quod he  ye may be glad and blithe
And thanketh god  an hundred thousand sithe
My lady queene  hath child with outen doute
To ioye and blisse  of al this regne aboute
 Lo here the lettres  seled of this thyng
That I moot bere  with al the haste I may
If ye wol aught vn to youre sone the kyng
I am youre seruaunt bothe nyght and day
Donegild answerde  as now at this tyme nay
But here al nyght I wol thow take thy reste
To morwe  wol I seye thee what me leste
s Messager  drank sadly ale and wyn  
And stolen were  his lettres pryuely
Out of his box  whil he sleep as a swyn
And countrefeted  was ful subtilly
Another lettre  wroght ful synfully
Vn to the kyng direct of this matere
ffro his Constable  as ye shal after heere
 The lettre spak  the queene deliuered was
Of so horrible  a fendlich creature
That in the Castel  noon so hardy was
That any while  dorste ther endure
The moder was an Elf  by auenture
Ycomen  by charmes  or by sorcerye
And euerich  hateth hir compaignye
  
 Wo was this kyng whan he this lettre hadde seyn
But to no wight he tolde his sorwes soore
But of his owene hond  he wroot ageyn
Welcome the sonde of Crist  for euere moore
To me  þat am now lerned in his loore
Lord  welcome be thy lust and thy plesaunce
My lust I putte al in thyn ordinaunce
 Kepeth this child  al be it foul or feir
And eek my wyf  vn to myn hom comynge
Crist whan hym list may sende me an heir
Moore agreable than this  to my likynge
This lettre he seleth  pryuely wepynge
Which to the Messager  was take soone
And forth he goth  ther is namoore to doone
 O Messager  fulfild of dronkenesse
Strong is thy breeth  thy lymes faltren ay
And thow biwreyest al secrenesse
The mynde is lorn  thow ianglest as a Iay
Thy face is turned  in a newe array
Ther dronkenesse regneth  in any route
Ther is no conseil hid  with outen doute
 O Donegild  I ne haue noon englissh digne  
Vn to thy malice  and thy tirannye
And ther fore  to the feend I thee resigne
Lat hym enditen  of thy traitorie
ffy mannyssh fy  o nay by god I lye

Thogh thow heere walke  thy spirit is in helle
 This Messager  comth fro the kyng agayn
And at the kynges modres Court he lighte
And she was  of this Messager ful fayn
And plesed hym  in al that euere she myghte
  
He drank  and wel his girdel vnder pighte
He slepeth  and he fnorteth in his gyse
Al nyght til the sonne gan aryse
 Eft were his lettres  stolen euerichon
And countrefeted lettres  in this wyse
The kyng comaundeth  his Constable anon
Vp peyne of hangyng and on heigh Iuyse
That he ne sholde suffren  in no wyse
Custance  in with his regne for tabyde
Thre dayes  and a quarter of o tyde
 But in the same Shipe  as he hir fond
Hire and hir yonge sone  and al hir geere
He sholde putte  and crowde hir fro the lond
And charge hire  þat she neuere eft coome there
O my Custaunce  wel may thy goost haue fere
And slepyng in thy dreem  been in penaunce
Whan Donegild  caste al this ordinaunce
 This Messager  on morwe whan he wook
Vn to the Castel  halt the nexte wey
And to the Constable  he the lettre took
And whan þat he  this pitous lettre sey
fful ofte  he seyde allas and weilawey
Lord crist quod he  how may this world endure
So ful of synne  is many a creature
 myghty god  if that it be thy wille  
Sith thow art rightful Iuge  how may it be
That thow wolt suffren  Innocentz to spille
And wikked folk  regnen in prosperitee
O goode Custaunce  allas so wo is me
That I moot be thy tormentour  or deye
On shames deeth  ther nys noon oother weye
  
 Wepen bothe yonge and olde  in al that place
Whan þat the kyng this cursed lettre sente
And Custance  with a dedly pale face
The ferthe day  toward hir shipe she wente
But nathelees  she taketh in good entente
The wyl of Crist  and knelyng on the Stronde
She seyde lord  ay wel come be thy sonde
 He þat me kepte  fro the false blame
Whil I was on the lond  amonges yow
He kan me kepe  fro harm and eek fro shame
In salte see  al thogh I se noght how
As strong as euere he was  he is yet now
In hym triste I  and in his moder deere
That is to me  my Sayl and eek my steere
 Hir litel child  lay wepyng in hir arm
And knelyng pitously to hym she seyde
Pees litel sone  I wol do thee noon harm
With that hir couerchief  ouer hir hed she breyde
And ouer his litel eyen  she it leyde
And in hir arm  she lulleth it ful faste
And in to heuene  hir eyen vp she caste
 Moder quod she  and mayden bright Marie
Sooth is  þat thurgh wommans eggement
Mankynde was lorn  and dampned ay to dye
ffor which thy child  was on a croys yrent
Thy blisful eyen  sawe al his torment
Thanne is ther  no comparison bitwene
Thy wo  and any wo man may sustene
 Thow saw thy child  yslayn bifor thyne eyen  
And yet now  lyueth my litel child parfay
Now lady bright to whom alle woful cryen
Thow glorie of wommanhod  thow faire may
  
Thow hauen of refut brighte sterre of day
Rewe on my child  that of thy gentillesse
Rewest on euery rewful in distresse
 O litel child  allas what is thy gilt
That neuere wroghtest synne  as yet pardee
Why wil thyn harde fader  han thee spilt
O mercy deere Constable  quod she
As lat my litel child  dwelle here with thee
And if thow darst noght sauen hym for blame
So kys hym ones  in his fader name
 Ther with she looketh  bakward to the londe
And seyde  fare wel housbonde routhelees
And vp she rist and walketh doun the Stronde
Toward the shipe  hir folweth al the prees
And euere  she preyeth hir child  to holde his pees
And taketh hir leue  and with an holy entente
She blesseth hire  and in to shipe she wente
 Vitailled was the shipe  it is no drede
Habundantly for hire  ful longe space
And othere necessaries  þat sholde nede
She hadde ynow  heryed be goddes grace
ffor wynd and weder  almyghty god purchace
And brynge hir hom  I kan no bettre seye
But in the see  she dryueth forth hir weye
 Alla the kyng comth hom soone after this
Vn to his Castel  of the which I tolde
And axeth  where his wyf  and his child is
The Constable  gan aboute his herte colde
  
And pleynly  al the manere he hym tolde
As ye han herd  I kan telle it no bettre
And sheweth the kyng his seel and his lettre
nd seyde lord  as ye comaunded me  
Vp peyne of deeth  so haue I do certein
This Messager  tormented was  til he
Moste biknowe  and tellen plat and pleyn
ffro nyght to nyght in what place he had leyn
And thus by wit and subtil enquerynge
Ymagined was  by whom this harm gan sprynge
 The hond was knowe  þat the lettre wroot
And al the venym  of this cursed dede
But in what wise  certeynly I noot
Theffect is this  þat Alla out of drede
His moder slow  that may men pleynly rede
ffor that she traytour was  to hir ligeaunce
Thus endeth olde Donegild with meschaunce
 The sorwe þat this Alla  nyght and day
Maketh for his wyf  and for his child also
Ther is no tonge  that it telle may
But now wol I  vn to Custaunce go
That fleteth in the See  in peyne and wo
ffyue yeer and moore  as liked Cristes sonde
Er þat hir shipe  approched vn to londe
 Vnder an hethen Castel  atte laste
Of which the name  in my text noght I fynde
Custaunce and eek hir child  the see vp caste
Almyghty god  that saueth al mankynde
Haue on Custaunce  and on hir child som mynde
That fallen is  in hethen hand eft soone
In point to spille  as I shal telle yow soone
  
 Down fro the Castel  comth ther many a wight
To gauren on this Shipe  and on Custaunce
But shortly from the Castel  on a nyght
The lordes Styward  god yeue hym meschaunce
A theef  that hadde reneyed oure creaunce
Cam in to shipe allone  and seyde he sholde
Hir lemman be  wher so she wolde or nolde
 Wo was this wrecched womman tho bigon  
Hir child cryde  and she cryde pitously
But blisful Marie  heelp hire right anon
ffor with hir strogelyng wel and myghtily
The theef  fil ouer bord  al sodeynly
And in the see  he dreynte for vengeaunce
And thus hath Crist vnwemmed kept Custaunce
 O foule lust of luxurie  lo thyn ende
Nat oonly  þat thou fayntest mannes mynde
But verraily  thow wolt his body shende
Thende of thy werk or of thy lustes blynde
Is compleynyng how many oon may men fynde
That noght for werk som tyme  but for thentente
To doon this synne  been outher slayn or shente
 How may this wayke womman  han this strengthe
Hir to defende  agayn this renegat
O Golias  vnmesurable of lengthe
How myghte dauid  make thee so maat
So yong and of armure so desolat
How dorste he looke  vp on thy dredful face
Wel may men seen  it was but goddes grace
 Who yaf Iudith  corage  or hardynesse
To sleen hym Olofernus  in his tente
And to deliueren  out of wrecchednesse
The peple of god  I sey for this entente
  
That right as god  spirit of vigour sente
To hem  and saued hem  out of meschaunce
So sente he myght and vigour to Custaunce
 fforth gooth hir shipe  thurgh out the narwe mouth
Of Iubaltare  and Septe  dryuyng ay
Som tyme West and som tyme North and South
And som tyme Est ful many a wery day
Til Cristes moder  blissed be she ay
Hath shapen  thurgh hir endelees goodnesse
To make an ende  of al hir heuynesse
ow lat vs stynte of Custaunce  but a throwe  
And speke we  of the Romayn Emperour
That out of Surrye  hath by lettres knowe
The slaughtre of cristen folk  and dishonour
Doon to his doghter  by a fals traytour
I mene  the cursed wikked Sowdanesse
That at the feeste  leet sleen bothe moore and lesse
 ffor which this Emperour  hath sent anon
His Senatour  with Roial ordinaunce
And othere lordes  god woot many oon
On Surryens  to taken heigh vengeaunce
They brennen  sleen  and brynge hem to meschaunce
fful many a day  but shortly this is thende
Homward to Rome  they shapen hem to wende
 This senatour  repaireth with Victorie
To Romeward  saylynge ful Roially
And mette the ship dryuynge  as seith the stori
In which Custaunce  sit ful pitously
No thyng ne knew he  what she was  ne why
She was in swich array  ne she nyl seye
Of hir estaat thogh she sholde deye
  
 He bryngeth hire to Rome  and to his wyf
He yaf hire  and hir yonge sone also
And with the Senatour  she ladde hir lyf
Thus kan oure lady  bryngen out of wo
Woful Custaunce  and many another mo
And longe tyme  dwelled she in that place
In holy werkes euere  as was hir grace
 The senatours wyf  hir Aunte was
But for al that she knew hir neuer the moore
I wol no lenger  taryen in this cas
But to kyng Alla  which I spak of yoore
That for his wyf  wepeth and siketh soore
I wol retourne  and lete I wole Custaunce
Vnder the Senatours gouernaunce
 Kyng Alla  which þat hadde his moder slayn  
Vp on a day  fil in swich repentaunce
That if I shortly  tellen shal and playn
To Rome he cometh  to receyuen his penaunce
And putte hym  in the Popes ordinaunce
In heigh and logh  and Ihesu Crist bisoghte
fforyeue  his wikked werkes þat he wroghte
 The fame anon  thurgh Rome town is born
How Alla kyng shal comen in pilgrymage
By herbergeours  that wenten hym biforn
ffor which the Senatour  as was vsage
Rood hym agayns  and many of his lynage
As wel to shewen  his heighe magnyficence
As to doon  any kyng a reuerence
 Greet cheere  doth this noble Senatour
To kyng Alla  and he to hym also
Euerich of hem  dooth oother greet honour
And so bifel  þat in a day  or two
  
This Senatour  is to kyng Alla go
To feste  and shortly  if I shal nat lye
Custaunces sone  wente in his compaignye
 Som men wolde seyn  at requeste of Custaunce
This Senatour  hath lad this child to feste
I may nat tellen  euerich circumstaunce
Be as be may  ther was he atte leste
But sooth is this  þat at his modres heste
Biforn Alla  duryng the metes space
The child stood  lookynge in the kynges face
 This Alla kyng hath of this child greet wonder
And to the Senatour  he seyde anon
Whos is that faire child  that stondeth yonder
I noot quod he  by god and by Seint Iohn
A moder he hath  but fader hath he non
That I of woot and shortly in a stounde
He tolde Alla  how þat this child was founde
t god woot quod this Senatour also  
So vertuous a lyuere  in my lyf
Ne saw I neuere as she  ne herde of mo
Of worldly wommen  mayde ne of wyf
I dar wel seyn  hir hadde leuere a knyf
Thurgh out hir brest than been a womman wikke
Ther is no man  koude brynge hire to that prikke
 Now was this child  as lyk vn to Custaunce
As possible is  a creature to be
This Alla  hath the face in remembraunce
Of dame Custaunce  and ther on mused he
If þat the childes moder  were aught she
That is his wyf  and pryuely he sighte
And spedde hym fro the table that he myghte
  
 Parfay thoughte he  fantome is in myn heed
I oghte deme  of skilful Iugement
That in the salte see  my wif is deed
And afterward  he made his argument
What woot I  if þat Crist hath hider sent
My wif by see  as wel as he hir sente
To my contree  from thennes þat she wente
 And after noon  hom with the Senatour
Goth Alla  for to seen this wonder chaunce
This Senatour  dooth Alla greet honour
And hastily  he sente after Custaunce
But tristeth wel  hir liste noght to daunce
Whan that she wiste  wher fore was that sonde
Vnnethe  vp on hir feet she myghte stonde
 Whan Alla saugh his wyf  faire he hir grette
And weepe  that it was routhe for to se
ffor at the firste look  he on hir sette
He knew wel verraily  þat it was she
And she for sorwe  as domb stant as a tree
So was hir herte shet in hir distresse
Whan she remembred  his vnkyndenesse
 Twies she swowneth  in his owene sighte  
He weepe  and hym excuseth pitously
Now god quod he  and his halwes brighte
So wisly on my soule  as haue mercy
That of youre harm  as giltlees am I
As is Maurice my sone  so lyk youre face
Ellis the feend  me fecche out of this place
 Long was the sobbyng and the bitter peyne
Er þat  hir woful hertes myghte cesse
Greet was the pitee  for to heere hem pleyne
Thurgh whiche pleintes  gan hir wo encresse
  
I pray yow  al my labour to relesse
I may nat telle hir wo  vn til to morwe
I am so wery  for to speke of sorwe
 But finally  whan þat the sooth is wist
That Alla  giltlees was of hir wo
I trowe  an hundred tymes been they kist
And swich a blisse  is ther bitwix hem two
That saue the ioye  þat lasteth eueremo
Ther is noon lyk  þat any creature
Hath seyn  or shal  whil þat the world may dure
 Tho preyde she  hir housbond mekely
In relief  of hir longe pitous pyne
That he wolde praye  hir fader specially
That of his magestee  he wolde enclyne
To vouche sauf  som day with hym to dyne
She preyde hym eek he sholde by no weye
Vn to hir fader  no word of hir seye
 Som men wolde seyn  how þat the child Mauryce
Dooth this message  vn to this Emperour
But as I gesse  Alla was noght so nyce
To hym þat was  of so souereyn honour
As he þat is  of cristen folk the flour
Sente any child  but it is bet to deme
He wente hym self and so it may wel seme
s Emperour  hath graunted gentilly  
To come to dyner  as he hym bisoghte
And wel rede I  he looked bisily
Vp on this child  and on his doghter thoghte
Alla gooth to his In  and as hym oghte
Arrayed for this feste in euery wise
As ferforth  as his konnyng may suffise
  
 The morwe cam  and Alla gan hym dresse
And eek his wyf  this Emperour to meete
And forth they ryde  in Ioye and in gladnesse
And whan she say  hir fader in the Streete
She lighte doun  and falleth hym to feete
ffader quod she  youre yonge child Custaunce
Is now ful clene  out of youre remembraunce
 I am youre doghter Custance  quod she
That whilom ye han sent  vn to Surrye
It am I fader  that in the salte See
Was put allone  and dampned for to dye
Now goode fader  mercy I yow crye
Seend me namoore  vn to noon hethenesse
But thonke my lord heere  of his kyndenesse
 Who kan the pitous Ioye  tellen al
Bitwix hem thre  syn they be thus ymette
But of my tale  make an ende I shal
The day goth faste  I wol no lenger lette
This glade folk to dyner they hem sette
In ioye and blisse  at mete I lete hem dwelle
A thousand fold  wel moore than I kan telle
 This child Maurice  was sithen Emperour
Maad by the Pope  and lyued cristenly
To cristes chirche  he dide greet honour
But I lete  al this storie passen by
Of Custaunce  is my tale specially
In the olde Romayn gestes  may men fynde
Maurices lyf  I bere it noght in mynde
 This kyng Alla  whan he his tyme say  
With his Custaunce  his holy wif so swete
To Engelond  been they com the righte way
Wher as they lyue  in ioye and in quiete
  
But litel while it lasteth I yow heete
Ioye of this world  for tyme wol nat abyde
ffro day to nyght it chaungeth as the tyde
 Who lyued euere  in swich delit  a day
That hym ne moeued  outher Conscience
Or Ire  or talent or som kyn affray
Enuye  or pryde  or passion  or offence
I ne seye  but for this ende this sentence
That litel while  in ioye  or in plesaunce
Lasteth the blisse of Alla with Custaunce
 ffor deeth that taketh  of heigh and logh his rente
Whan passed was a yeer  euene as I gesse
Out of this world  this kyng Alla he hente
ffor whom Custaunce  hath ful greet heuynesse
Now lat vs prayen god  his soule blesse
And dame Custance  fynally to seye
Toward the town of Rome  gooth hir weye
 To Rome is come  this holy creature
And fyndeth hir freendss  hoole and sownde
Now is she scaped  al hir auenture
And whan that she  hir fader hath yfownde
Doun on hir knees  falleth she to grownd
Wepynge for tendrenesse  in herte blythe
She herieth god  an hondred thousand sythe
 In vertue  and holy almesdede
They lyuen alle  and neuere asonder wende
Til deeth departeth hem  this lyf they lede
And fareth now wel  my tale is at an ende
Now Ihesu crist that of his myght may sende
Ioye after wo  gouerne vs in his grace
And kepe vs alle  that been in this place Amen  
AT Sarray  in the land of Tartarye
Ther dwelte a kyng that werreyed Russye
Thurgh which  ther deyde many a doghty man
This noble kyng was clepid kambynskan
Which in his tyme  was of so greet renoun
That ther nas nowher in no Regioun
So excellent a lord  in alle thyng
Hym lakked noght þat longed to a kyng
As of the secte  of which þat he was born
He kepte his lay  to which þat he was sworn
And ther to  he was hardy  wys  and riche
Pietous and Iust and euere moore yliche
Sooth of his word  benigne and honurable
Of his corage  as any Centre stable
Yong fressh  and strong in armes desirous
As any Bachiler  of al his hous
A fair persone he was  and fortunat
And kepte alwey  so wel Roial estat
That ther nas no wher  swich another man
 This noble kyng  this Tartre Cambynskan
Hadde two sones  on Elfeta his wyf
Of whiche  the eldeste highte Algarsyf
That oother sone  was clepid Cambalo
A doghter hadde  this worthy kyng also
That yongest was  and highte Canacee
But for to telle yow  al hir beautee
It lyth nat in my tonge  nyn my konnyng
I dar nat vndertake  so heigh a thyng
  
Myn englyssh eek  is insufficient
It moste been  a Rethor excellent
That koude his colours  longyng for that Art
If he sholde hire  discryuen euery part
I am noon swich  I moot speke as I kan
And so bifel  that whan this kambynskan
Hath xx wynter  born his dyademe
As he was wont fro yeer to yeer I deme

n crien  thurgh out Sarray his Citee
The laste Idus of March  after the yeer
Phebus the sonne  ful iolyf was and cleer
ffor he was ny his exaltacion
In Martes face  and his mansion
In Aries  the Coleryk hote signe
fful lusty was the weder  and benygne
ffor which the foweles  agayn the sonne shene
What for the seson  and the yonge grene
fful loude songen  hir affeccions
Hem semed  han geten hem proteccions
Agayn the swerd of wynter  kene and cold
 This Cambynskan  of which I haue yow told
In Roial vestyment sit on his deys
With dyademe  ful hye in his paleys
And halt his feste  solempne and so riche
That in this world  ne was ther noon it liche
Of which  if I shal tellen al tharray
Thanne wolde it ocupie  a someres day
And eek it nedeth nat to deuyse
At euery cours  the ordre of hir seruyse
I wol nat tellen  of hir straunge sewes
Ne of her swannes  ne of hir heron sewes
Eek in that land  as tellen knyghtes olde
Ther is som mete  þat is ful deyntee holde
That in this land  men recche of it but smal
Ther nys no man  þat may reporten al
  
I wol nat tarien yow  for it is pryme
And for it is no fruyt but los of tyme
Vn to my firste  I wol haue my recours
 And so bifel  þat after the thridde Cours
Whil þat this kyng sit thus  in his nobleye
Herknynge his Mynstrals  hir thynges pleye
Biforn hym at the bord  deliciously
In at the halle dore  al sodeynly
Ther cam a knyght vp on a Steede of bras
And in his hand  a brood Mirour of glas
Vp on his thombe  he hadde  of gold a ryng
And by his syde  a naked swerd hangyng
And vp he rydeth  to the heighe bord  
In al the halle  ne was ther spoke a word
ffor merueille of this knyght hym to biholde
fful bisily  they wayten  yonge and olde
 This straunge knyght that cam thus sodeynly
Al armed saue his heed  ful richely
Salueth kyng and queene  and lordes alle
By ordre  as they seten in the halle
With so heigh reuerence  and obeisances
As wel in his speche  as in his contenances
That Gawayn  with his olde curteisye
Thogh he were come agayn  out of ffairye
Ne koude hym nat amende  with a word
And after this  biforn the hye bord
He with a manly voys  seyde his message
After the forme  vsed in his langage
With outen vice  of silable  or of lettre
And for his tale  sholde seme the bettre
Acordant to his wordes  was his cheere
As techeth art of speche  hem þat it leere
Al be  þat I kan nat sowne  his style
Ne kan nat clymben  ouer so heigh a style
Yet seye I this  þat as to commune entente
Thus muche amounteth  al that euere he mente
  
If it so be  þat I haue it in my mynde
 He seyde  the kyng of Arabe  and of Inde
My lige lord  on this solempne day
Salueth yow  as he best kan and may
And sendeth yow  in honour of youre feste
By me  that am al redy  at youre heste
This Steede of bras  that esily and weel
Kan in the space  of o day naturel
This is to seyn  in xxiiij houres
Wher so yow list in droghte  or ellis shoures
Beren youre body  in to euery place
To which youre herte  wilneth for to pace
With outen wem of yow  thurgh foul or fair
Or if yow list to flee as hye in the Ayr
As dooth an Egle  whan hym list to soore
This same Steede  shal bere yow euere moore
 outen harm  til ye be ther yow leste
ough þat ye slepen  on his bak  or reste
And turne agayn  with writhyng of a pyn
He þat it wroghte  koude many a gyn
He wayted  many a constellacion
Er he hadde doon  this operacion
And knew ful many a seel  and many a bond
 This Mirour eek that I haue in myn hond
Hath swich a myght þat men may in it see
Whan ther shal fallen  any aduersitee
Vn to youre regne  or to your sel also
And openly  who is youre freend  or fo
 And ouer al this  if any lady bright
Hath set hir herte  on any maner wight
If he be fals  she shal his trayson see
His newe loue  and al his subtiltee
So openly  þat ther shal no thyng hyde
Wher fore  agayn this lusty Someres tyde
This Mirour and this ryng þat ye may see
He hath sent to my lady Canacee
  
Youre excellente doghter þat is heere
 The vertu of the ryng if ye wol heere
Is this  þat if hir list it for to were
Vp on hir thombe  or in hir purs it bere
Ther nys no fowel  þat fleeth vnder the heuene
That she ne shal wel  vnderstonde his steuene
And knowe his menyng openly and pleyn
And answere hym  in his langage ageyn
And euery gras  þat groweth vp on roote
She shal eek knowe  and whom it wol doon boote
Al be his woundes  neuer so depe and wyde
 This naked swerd  þat hangeth by my syde
Swich vertu hath  þat what man so ye smyte
Thurgh out his armure  it wol kerue and byte
Were it as thikke  as is a braunched ook
And what man  þat is wounded with the Strook
Shal neuere be hool  til þat yow lust of grace
To stroke hym with the platte  in thilke place
Ther he is hurt this is as muche to seyn
Ye moote  with the platte swerd ageyn
Stroke hym in the wounde  and it wol close  
This is a verray sooth  with outen glose
It failleth nat  whiles it is in youre hold
And whan this knyght hath thus his tale ytold
He rideth out of halle  and doun he lighte
 His Steede which þat shoon  as sonne brighte
Stant in the Court stille as any stoon
This knyght is to his chambre lad anon
And is vnarmed  and to mete yset
The presentz  been ful realliche yfet
This is to seyn  the swerd and the Mirour
And born anon  in to the heighe tour
With certein Officers  ordeyned ther fore
And vn to Canacee  the ryng is bore
Solempnely  ther she sit at the table
But sikerly  with outen any fable
  
The hors of bras  þat may nat been remewed
It stant as it were  to the ground yglewed
Ther may no man  out of the place it dryue
ffor noon engyn  of wyndas or polyue
And cause why  for they kan nat the craft
And ther fore  in the place  they han it laft
Til þat the knyght hath taught hem the manere
To voyden hym  as ye shal after heere
 Greet was the prees  that swarmeth to and fro
To gauren on this hors  that stondeth so
ffor it so heigh was  and so brood and long
So wel proporcioned  for to ben strong
Right as it were  a Steede of lumbardye
Therwith so horsly  and so quyk of eye
As it a gentil Poyleys courser weere
ffor certes  fro his tayl  vn to his eere
Nature  ne art ne koude hym nat amende
In no degree  as al the peple wende
 But euere moore  hir mooste wonder was
How þat it koude goon  and was of bras
It was a ffairye  as the peple semed
Dyuerse folk dyuersely han demed
As many heuedes  as many wittes ther been
They murmured  as dooth a swarm of been
 maden skiles  after hir fantasies
Rehersynge  of thise olde Poetries
And seyden  it was lyk the Pegasee
The hors  þat hadde wynges for to flee
Or ellis it was  the Grekys hors Synon
That broghte Troye  to destruccion
As men  in thise olde gestes rede
 Myn herte quod oon  is euere moore in drede
I trowe  som men of armes been ther Inne
That shapen hem  this Citee for to wynne
It were right good  þat al swich thyng were knowe
 Another rowned  to his felawe lowe
  
And seyde he lyeth  for it is rather lyk
An apparence  ymaad by som magyk
As Iogelours pleyen  at thise festes grete
Of sondry doutes  thus they iangle and trete
As lewed peple  demeth comunly
Of thynges  þat been moore maad subtilly
Than they kan  in hir lewednesse comprehende
They demen gladly  to the badder ende
 And somme of hem  wondren on the Mirour
That born was vp  vn to the maister tour
How men myghte in it swiche thynges se
 Another answerde  and seyde it myghte wel be
Naturelly  by composicions 
Of anglis  and of sly reflexions
And seiden  þat in Rome was swich oon
They speke of Alocen  and Vitulon
Of Aristotle  þat writen in hir lyues
Of queynte Mirours  and of perspectyues
As knowen they  þat han hir bookes herd
 And oother folk han wondred on the swerd
That wolde percen  thurgh out euery thyng
And fille in speche  of Thelophus the kyng
And of Achilles  for his queynte spere
ffor he koude with it bothe heele and dere
Right in swich wise  as men may  with the swerd
Of which right now  ye han your seluen herd
 They speeke  of sondry hardyng of metal
And speke of medicynes  ther with al
And how  and whanne  it sholde yharded be  
Which is vnknowe  algates vn to me
 Tho speeke they  of Canacees ryng
And seyden alle  þat swich a wonder thyng
Of craft of rynges  herde they neuere non
Saue þat he Moyses  and kyng Salomon
Hadde a name of konnyng in swich art
Thus seyn the peple  and drawen hem a part
  
 But nathelees  somme seyden þat it was
Wonder  to maken of fern asshen glas
And yet is glas  nat lyk asshen of fern
But for they han  knowen it so fern
Therfore  cesseth hir Ianglyng and hir wonder
 As soore wondren somme  on cause of thonder
On ebbe and flood  on gossomer  and on myst
And alle thyng til þat the cause is wist
Thus Ianglen they  and demen and deuyse
Til that the kyng gan fro the bord aryse
 Phebus hath laft the angle Meridional
And yet ascendyng is  the beest roial
The gentil leon  with his Aldiran
Whan þat this tartre kyng Cambynskan
Roos fro his bord  ther as he sat ful hye
Biforn hym gooth  the loude Mynstralcye
Til he cam  to his chambre of parementz
There as ther sownen  diuerse Instrumentz
That it is lyk  an heuene for to heere
Now dauncen  lusty Venus children deere
ffor in the fissh  hir lady sat ful hye
And looketh on hem  with a freendly eye
 This noble kyng is set vp on his trone
This straunge knyght is fet to hym ful soone
And on the daunce he gooth  with Canacee
Here is  the reuel  and the Iolitee
That is nat able  a dul man to deuyse
He moste han knowe  loue and his seruyse
And been a festlich man  as fressh as May
That sholde yow deuysen  swich array
 Who koude telle yow  the forme daunces
So vnkouthe  and swiche fresshe contenaunces

No man but launcelot and he is deed
Ther fore I passe  of al this lustiheed

 The Styward  byt Spices for to hye
And eek the wyn  in al this melodye
The vsshers  and the Squyers  been ygon
The Spices and the wyn  is come anon
They ete and drynke  and whan this hadde an ende
Vn to the temple  as reson was they wende
 The seruyce doon  they soupen al by day
What nedeth yow  rehercen hir array
Ech man woot wel  þat at a kynges feste
Hath plentee  to the meeste  and to the leeste
And deyntees  mo than been in my knowyng
At after souper  gooth this noble kyng
To seen this hors of bras  with al a route
Of lordes  and of ladyes  hym aboute
 Swich wondryng was ther on this hors of bras
That syn the grete sege  of Troye was
Ther as men wondreden  on an hors also
Ne was ther  swich a wondryng as was tho
But finally  the kyng axeth this knyght
The vertu of this Courser  and the myght
And preyed hym  to telle his gouernaunce
 This hors anon  gan for to trippe and daunce
Whan þat this knyght leyde hand vp on his reyne
And seyde sire  ther nys namoore to seyne
But whan yow list to ryden any where
Ye moten trille a pyn  stant in his ere
Which I shal yow telle  bitwixe vs two
Ye mote nempne hym  to what place also
Or to what contree  þat yow list to ryde
And whan ye come  ther as yow list abyde
Byd hym descende  and tryl another pyn
ffor ther Inne lyth  theffect of al the gyn
And he wol doun descende  and doon youre wille
And in that place  he wol abiden stille
  
Theigh al the world  the contrarie hadde yswore  
He shal nat thennes  be ydrawe nor ybore
Or if yow list  bidde hym thennes gon
Trille this pyn  and he wol vanysshe anon
Out of the sighte  of euery maner wight
And come agayn  be it day or nyght
Whan þat yow list to clepen hym ageyn
In swich a gyse  as I shal to yow seyn
Bitwixen yow and me  and that ful soone
Ryd whan yow lust ther is namoore to doone
 Enformed  whan the kyng was of that knyght
And hath conceyued  in his wit aright
The manere  and the forme  of al this thyng
fful glad and blythe  this noble doghty kyng
Repeireth to his reuel  as biforn
The brydel is  vn to the tour yborn
And kept among his Iewels  lief and deere
The hors vanysshed  I noot in which manere
Out of hir sighte  ye gete namoore for me
But thus I lete  in lust and Iolitee
This Cambynskan  his lordes festeyynge
Til wel neigh  the day bigan to sprynge
The norice of digestion  the sleepe
Gan on hem wynke  and bad hem take keepe
That muche drynke and labour  wol haue reste
And with a galpyng mouth  hem alle he keste
And seyde  that it was tyme  to lye adoun
ffor blood  was in his domynacioun
Cherisseth blood  natures freend quod he
They thanken hym galpynge  by two  by thre
And euery wight gan drawe hym to his reste
As sleepe hem bad  they take it for the beste
  
 Hir dremes  shul nat now be toold for me
fful were hir heuedes  of fumositee
seth dreem  of which ther nys no charge
y slepen  til that it was pryme large
The mooste part but it were Canacee
She was ful mesurable  as wommen be
ffor of hir fader  hadde she take leue
To goon to reste  soone after it was eue
Hir liste nat apalled for to be
Nor on the morwe  vnfestlich for to se
And slepte hir firste sleep  and awook
ffor swich a ioye  she in her herte took
Bothe of hir queynte ryng and hir Mirour
That xx tyme  she chaunged hir colour
And in hir sleepe  right for impression
Of hir Mirour  she hadde a vision
Wher fore  er þat the sonne gan vp glyde
She clepyd  vp on hir maistresse  hir bisyde
And seyde  þat hir liste for to ryse
 Thise olde wommen  þat been gladly wyse
As is hir maystresse  answerde hir anon
And seyde  madame  whider wolde ye gon
Thus erly  for the folk been alle on reste
 I wol quod she aryse  for me leste
No lenger for to slepe  and walke aboute
Hir maistresse  clepith wommen  a gret route
And vp they rysen  wel an x or xije

Vp riseth  fresshe Canacee hir selue
As rody and bright as dooth the yonge sonne
That in the ram  is 4 degrees vp ronne
Noon hyere was he  whan she redy was
And forth she walketh  esily a pas
Arrayed  after the lusty seson soote
Lightly for to pleye  and walke on foote
Nat but with v or vj of hir meynee
And in a trench  forth in the park goth she
  
 The vapour  which þat fro the erthe glood
Made the sonne  to seme rody and brood
But nathelees  it was so fair a sighte
That it made  al hir hertes for to lighte
What for the seson  and the morwenynge
And for the fowles  that she herde synge
ffor right anon  she wiste what they mente  
Right by hir song and knew al hir entente
 The knotte  why  that euery tale is told
If it be taryed  til þat lust be cold
Of hem  þat han it after herkned yoore
The sauour passeth  euer lenger the moore
ffor fulsomnesse  of his prolixitee
And by this same reson  thynketh me
I scholde  to the knotte condescende
And maken of hir walkyng soone an ende
 Amydde a tree  for drye as whit as chalk
As Canacee  was pleyynge in hir walk
Ther sat a ffawkon  ouer hir heed ful hye
And with a pitous voys  so gan to crye
That al the wode  resowned of hir cry
ybeten hadde she hir self  so pitously
with bothe hir wynges  til the rede blood
Ran endelong the tree  ther as she stood
And euere in oon  she cryde alwey and shrighte
And with hir beek hir seluen so she prighte
That ther nys tygre  ne so cruel beest
That dwelleth  outher in wode  or in fforest
That nolde han wept  if þat he wepe koude
ffor sorwe of hire  she shrighte alwey so loude
 ffor ther nas neuere man  yet on lyue
If þat I koude  a ffaukon wel discryue
That herde of swich another  of fairnesse
As wel of plumage  as of gentillesse
Of shape  of al that myghte yrekened be
A ffaukon peregryn  thanne semed she
  
Of fremde land  and euere moore as she stood
She swowned now and now  for lakke of blood
Til wel neigh  is she fallen  fro that tree
 This faire kynges doghter Canacee
That on hir fynger  baar the queynte ryng
Thurgh which  she vnderstood wel euery thyng
That any fowl  may in his ledne sayn
And koude answere hym  in his ledne agayn
Hath vnderstonden  what this ffaukon seyde
And wel neigh for the routhe  almoost she deyde
o the tree  she goth ful hastily
nd on this ffaukon  looketh pitously
And heeld hir lappe abrood  for wel she wiste
The ffaukon  moste fallen fro the twiste
Whan þat it swowneth next for lakke of blood
A long while  to wayten hir she stood
Til at the laste  she spak  in this manere
Vn to the hauk  as ye shal after heere
 What is the cause  if it be for to telle
That ye been  in this furial pyne of helle
Quod Canacee  vn to this hauk aboue
Is this for sorwe of deeth  or los of loue
ffor as I trowe  thise been causes two
That causen moost a gentil herte wo
Of oother harm  it nedeth nat to speke
ffor ye your self  vp on yow self yow wreke
Which proeueth wel  þat outher Ire or drede
Moot been encheson  of youre cruel dede
Syn þat I se  noon oother wight yow chace
ffor loue of god  as dooth your seluen grace
Or what may been youre help  for west nor Est
Ne saw I neuere er now  no bryd ne beest
That ferde  with hym self so pitously
Ye sleen me  with youre sorwe verraily
I haue of yow  so greet compassioun
ffor goddes loue  com fro the tree adoun
  
And as I am  a kynges doghter trewe
If þat I verraily  the cause knewe
Of youre disese  if it laye in my myght
I wolde amende it er that it were nyght
As wisly help me  grete god of kynde
And herbes  shal I right ynowe fynde
To heele with  youre hurtes hastily
 Tho shrighte this ffaukon  yet moore pitously
Than euer she dide  and fil to ground anon
And lyth aswowne deed  and lik a ston
Til Canacee  hath in hir lappe hir take
Vn to that tyme  she gan of swowne awake
And aftere  that she of swow  gan abreyde
Right in hir haukes ledne  thus she seyde
That pitee renneth soone  in gentil herte  
ffeelynge his similitude  in peynes smerte
Is proued al day  as men may it see
As wel by werk as by auctoritee
ffor gentil herte  kitheth gentilesse
I se wel  þat ye han of my distresse
Compassion  my faire Canacee
Of verray  wommanly benygnitee
That nature  in youre principles hath set
But for noon hope  for to fare the bet
But for to obeye  vn to youre herte free
And for to maken othere  ywar by me
As by the whelpe  chasted is the leon
Right for that cause  and for that conclusion
Whil þat I haue  a leyser and a space
Myn harm  I wol confessen  er I pace
And euere  whil þat oon  hir sorwe tolde
That oother weep  as she to water wolde
Til þat the ffaukon  bad hir to be stille
And with a syk right thus she seyde hir wille
 Ther I was bred  allas that ilke day
And fostred in a Roch  of Marbul gray
  
So tendrely  þat no thyng eyled me
I nyste nat what was aduersitee
Til I koude fle  ful hye vnder the sky
Tho dwelte a tercelet me faste by
That semed welle  of alle gentillesse
Al were he ful  of trayson and falsnesse
If was so wrapped  vnder humble cheere
And vnder hewe of trouthe  in swich manere
Vnder plesaunce  and vnder bisy peyne
That no wight wolde han wend  he koude feyne
So depe in greyn  he dyed his colours
Right as a serpent hit hym vnder floures
Til he may se his tyme  for to byte
Right so  this god of loues ypocrite
Dooth so his cerymonijs  and obeysances
And kepeth in semblant alle hise obseruances
That sownen  in to gentilesse of loue
As on a Tombe  is al the faire aboue
d vnder is the cors  swich as ye woot
Swich was this ypocrite  bothe cold and hoot
And in this wise  he serued his entente
That saue the feend  noon wiste what he mente
Til he so longe  hadde wopen and compleyned
A many a yeer  his seruice to me feyned
Til that myn herte  to pitous and to nyce
Al Innocent of his crowned malice
fforfered of his deeth  as thoughte me
Vp on his othes  and his seuretee
Graunted hym loue  vp on this condicioun
That euere mo  myn honour and renoun
Were saued  bothe pryuee and apert
That is to seyn  that after his desert
I yaf hym al myn herte  and my thoght
God woot and he  þat oother wise noght
And took his herte  in chaunge of myn for ay
But sooth is seyd  goon sithen many a day
  
A trewe wight and a theef  thynketh nat oon
 And whanne he saw the thyng so fer ygon
That I hadde graunted hym fully my loue
In swich a gise  as I haue seyd aboue
And yeuen hym  my trewe herte as fre
As he swoor  he yaf his herte to me
Anoon this tygre  ful of doublenesse
ffil on his knees  with so deuout humblesse
With so heigh reuerence  and as by his cheere
So lyk a gentil louere  of manere
So rauysshed  as it semed for the ioye
That neuere Iason  ne Parys of Troye
Iason certes  ne noon oother man
Syn Lameth was  þat alderfirst bigan
To louen two  as writen folk biforn
Ne neuere  syn  the firste man was born
Ne koude man  by twenty thousand part
Countrefete  the Sophymes of his art
Ne were worthy  vnbokele his galoche
Ther doublenesse  or feynyng sholde approche
Ne so koude thanke a wight as he did me
His manere  was an heuene for to see
Til any womman  were she neuer so wys  
So peynted he  and kembde at poynt deuys
As wel his wordes  as his contenaunce
And I so loued hym  for his obeisaunce
And for the trouthe  I demed in his herte
That if so weere  that any thyng hym smerte
Al were it neuer so litel  and I it wiste
Me thoughte  I felte deeth myn herte twiste
And shortly  so ferforth this thyng is went
That my wyl  was his willes Instrument
This is to seyn  my wyl obeyed his wil
In alle thyng as fer as reson fil
Kepynge the boundes  of my worship euere
Ne neuere hadde I thyng so lief ne leuere
  
As hym god woot ne neuere shal namo
 This laste lenger  than a yeer  or two
That I supposed of hym nat but good
But finally  thus a the laste it stood
That ffortune wolde  þat he moste twynne
Out of that place  which þat I was Inne
Wher me was wo  that is no question
I kan nat make of it descripsion
ffor o thyng dar I tellen boldely
I knowe what is  the peyne of deeth ther by
Swich harm I felte  for he ne myghte bileue
So on a day  of me he took his leue
So sorwefully eek that I wende verraily
That he hadde feelyd  as muche harm as I
Whan that I herde hym speke  and saw his hewe
But nathelees  I thoughte he was so trewe
And eek that he repeyre sholde agayn
With Inne a litel while  sooth to sayn
And reson wolde eek þat he moste go
ffor his honour  as ofte happeth so
That I made  vertu of necessitee
And took it wel  syn þat it moste be
As I best myghte  I hidde from hym my sorwe
And took hym by the hand  Seint Iohn to borwe
And seyde thus  lo I am youres al
Beeth swich  as I to yow haue been and shal
 answerde  it nedeth nat reherse
 kan seyn bet than he  who kan doon werse
han he hath al wel seyd  thanne hath he doon
Ther fore bihoued hire  a ful long spoon
That shal ete with a feend  thus herde I seye
So at the laste  he moste forth his weye
And forth he fleeth  til he cam ther hym leste
 Whan it cam hym  to purpos for to reste
I trowe he hadde  thilke text in mynde
That alle thing repeiryng to his kynde  
Gladeth hym self  thus seyn men as I gesse
Men louen of propre kynde  Newfangelnesse
As bryddes doon  that men in Cages feede
ffor theigh thow  nyght and day  take of hem hede
And strawe hir Cages  faire  and softe as sylk
And yeue hem sugre  hony  breed  and Milk
Yet right anon  as þat his dore is vppe
He with his feet wol sporne doun his cuppe
And to the wode he wole  and wormes ete
So newfangel  been they of hir mete
And louen nonelries  of propre kynde
No gentilesse of blood  may hem bynde
 So ferde this gentil tercelet allas the day
Thogh he were gentil born  and fressh and gay
And goodlich for to seen  and humble and free
He saw vp on a tyme  a kyte flee
And sodeynly  he loued this kyte so
That al his loue  is clene fro me ago
And hath his trouthe  falsed in this wise
Thus hath the kyte  my loue in hir seruyse
And I am lorn  with outen remedye
And with that word  this ffaukon gan to crye
And swowned eft in Canacees barm
 Greet was the sorwe  for the haukes harm
That Canacee  and alle hir wommen made
They nyste  how þat they myghte the ffaukon glade
But Canacee  hom bereth hire  in hir lappe
And softely  in plastres gan hir wrappe
Ther as she with hir beek hadde hurt hir selue
 Now kan nat Canacee  but herbes delue
Out of the grownd  and maken Saues newe  
Of herbes preciouse  and fyn of hewe
To heelen with this hauk  fro day to nyght
She dooth hir bisynesse  and al hir myght
And by hir beddes heed  she made a Muwe
And couered it  with veluettes blue
  
In signe of trouthe  that is in wommen sene
And al with oute  the Muwe is peynted grene
In which were peynted  alle thise false fowles
As been thise tydyues  terceletz  and Owles
Right for despit were peynted hem bisyde
And Pyes  on hem  for to crye  and chyde
 Thus lete I Canacee  hir hauk kepyng
I wol namoore as now  speke of hir ryng
Til it come eft to purpos for to seyn
How that this ffaukon  gat hir loue ageyn
Repentant  as the storie telleth vs
By mediacion  of Cambalus
The kynges sone  of which I to yow tolde
But hennes fort I wol my proces holde
To speke of auentures  and of batailles
That neuere yet was herd  so greet meruailles
 ffirst wol I telle yow  of Cambynskan
That in his tyme  many a Citee wan
 And after  wol I speke  of Algarsyf
How that he wan  Theodora to his wyf
ffor whom ful ofte  in gret peril he was
Ne hadde he been holpen  by the Steede of bras
 And after  wol I speke of Cambalo
That faught in lystes  with the bretheren two
ffor Canacee  er that he myghte hir wynne
And ther I lefte  I wol ayein bigynne
Appollo whirleth vp  his Char so hye
Til that  the god Mercuries hous the slye

IN feith squyer thow hast thee wel yquyt
And gentilly  I preise wel thy wit
Quod the Marchant considerynge thy youthe
So feelyngly thow spekest sire I allowthe
As to my doom  ther is noon þat is heere
Of eloquence  þat shal be thy peere
If þat thow lyue  god yeue thee good chaunce
And in vertu  sende thee continuaunce
ffor of thy speche  I haue gret deyntee
I haue a sone  and by the Trinitee
I hadde leuere  than xxti pound worth lond
Thogh it right now  were fallen in myn hond
He were a man  of swich discrecion
As þat ye ben  fy on possession
But if a man  be vertuous with al
I haue my sone snybbed  and yit shal
ffor he to vertu  lusteth nat entende
But for to pleye at dees  and to despende
And lese al that he hath  is his vsage
And he hath leuere  talken with a page
Than to commune  with any gentil wight
Where he myghte lerne  gentillesse aright
 Straw for youre gentillesse  quod oure hoost
What Marchant  pardee sire wel thow woost
That ech of yow  moot tellen atte leeste
A tale  or two  or breken his biheste
 That knowe I wel sire  quod the Marchant certeyn
I prey yow  haueth me nat in desdeyn
  
Thogh to this man  I speke a word or two
 Telle on thy tale  with outen wordes mo
 Gladly sire hoost quod he  I wol obeye
Vn to youre wyl  now herkneth what I seye
I wole yow nat contrarien  in no wise
As fer  as þat my wittes wole suffise
I prey to god  that it may plesen yow
Thanne woot I wel  that it is good ynow
Whilom  ther was dwellynge in Lumbardye
A worthy knyght  that born was of Pauye
In which he lyuede  in greet prosperitee
And lx yeer  a wiflees man was he
And folwed ay  his bodily delit
On wommen  ther as was his appetit
As doon thise fooles  that been seculer
And whan that he  was passed lx yeer
Were it for holynesse  or for dotage
I kan nat seye  but swich a greet corage
Hadde this knyght to been a wedded man
That day and nyght  he dooth al that he kan
Tespien  where he myghte wedded be
Preyynge oure lord  to graunten hym  þat he
Mighte ones knowe  of thilke blisful lyf
That is  bitwix an housbonde and his wyf
And for to lyue  vnder that holy bond
With which  þat god  man and womman boond
Noon oother lyf seyde he  is worth a bene
ffor wedlok is so esy  and so clene
That in this world  it is a Paradys
Thus seyde this olde knyght þat was so wys
 And certeynly  as sooth as god is kyng
To take a wyf  it is a glorious thyng
And namely  whan a man is old and hoor
Thanne is a wyf  the fruyt of his tresor
Thanne sholde he take a yong wyf and a feir
On which he myghte  engendren hym an heir
  
And lede his lyf in ioye  and in solas
Wher as thise Bachilers  synge allas
Whan þat they fynde  any aduersitee
In loue  which nys but childissh vanytee
And trewely  it sit wel to be so
That Bachilers  haue ofte peyne and wo
On brotil ground they bilde  and brotilnesse
They fynde  whan they wene sikernesse
ue  but as bryd  or as a beest
ibertee  and vnder noon arest
her as a wedded man  in his estat
Lyueth a lyf  blisful and ordynat
Vnder this yok of mariage ybounde
Wel may his herte  in ioye and blisse habounde
ffor who kan be  so buxom as a wyf
Who is so trewe  and eek so ententyf
To kepe hym syk and hool  as is his make
ffor wele or wo  she wol hym nat forsake
She nys nat wery  hym to loue  and serue
Thogh þat he ly bedrede  til he sterue
And yet som clerkes seyn  it is nat so
Of whiche  he Theofraste  is oon of tho
What force  thogh Theofraste liste lye
 Ne tak no wyf quod he  for housbondrye
As for to spare  in houshold thy dispence
A trewe seruant dooth moore diligence
Thy good to kepe  than thyn owene wyf
ffor she wol clayme  half part al hir lyf
And if thow be syk  so god me saue
Thy verray freendes  or a trewe knaue
Wol kepe thee bet than she  that wayteth ay
After thy good  and hath do many a day
And if thow take a wyf 1 she wole destroye
Thy good substance  and thy body annoye1
 This sentence  and an hundred thynges worse
Writeth this man  ther god his bones curse
  
But tak no kepe  of al swich vanytee
Diffye Theofraste  and herke me
 A wyf is goddes yifte verraily
Alle othere manere yiftes hardily
As londes  rentes  pasture  or comune
Or moebles  alle been yiftes of fortune
That passen  as a shadwe vp on the wal
But dreed nat if pleynly speke I shal
A wyf wol laste  and in thyn hous endure
Wel lenger than thee lyst perauenture
 Mariage  is a ful greet sacrament
He  which þat hath no wyf I holde hym shent
He lyueth helplees  and al desolat  
I speke of folk in seculer estat
 And herke why  I sey nat this for noght
That womman is  for mannes helpe ywroght
The hye god  whan he hadde Adam maked
And seigh hym allone  bely naked
God of his grete goodnesse seyde than
Lat vs now make an help  vnto this man
Lyk to hym self and thanne he made hym Eue
Here may ye see  and here may ye preeue
That wyf is mannes helpe  and his confort
His Paradys terrestre  and his disport
So buxom  and so vertuous is she
They moste nedes lyue in vnytee
O flessh they been  and o flessh as I gesse
Hath but oon herte  in wele and in distresse
 A wyf  a Seinte Marie benedicitee
How myghte a man  han any aduersitee
That hath a wyf  certes I kan nat seye
The blisse  which þat is bitwix hem tweye
Ther may no tonge telle  or herte thynke
If he be poure  she helpeth hym to swynke
She kepeth his good  and wasteth neuer a del
Al that hir housbonde lust hir liketh wel
  
She seith nat ones nay  whan he seith yee
Do this seith he  al redy sire seith she
 O blisful ordre  o wedlok precious
Thou art so murye  and eek so vertuous
And so commended  and approued eek
That any man  that halt hym worth a leek
Vp on his bare knees  oghte al his lyf
Thanken his god  that hym hath sent a wyf
Or ellis preye to god  hym for to sende
A wyf to laste vn to his lyues ende
ffor thanne his lyf  is set in sikernesse
He may nat be  deceyued  as I gesse
So that he werke  after his wyues reed
Thanne may he boldely  kepen vp his heed
They been so trewe  and ther with al so wyse
ffor which  if thow wolt werken as the wyse
wey so  as wommen wol thee rede
o how that Iacob  as thise clerkes rede
By good conseil  of his moder Rebekke
Boond the kydes skyn  aboute his nekke
ffor which  his fadres benyson he wan
 Lo Iudith  as the storie eek telle kan
By good conseil  she goddes peple kepte
And slow hym Olofernus  whil he slepte
 Lo Abigayl  by good conseil  how she
Saued hir housbonde Nabal  whan þat he
Sholde han ben slayn  and looke Ester also
By good conseil  delyuered out of wo
The peple of god  and made hym Mardochee
Of Assuere  enhaunced for to be
 Ther nys no thyng in gree superlatyf
As seith Senec  aboue an humble wyf
 Suffre thy wyues tonge  as Caton byt
She shal comaunde  and thow shalt suffren it 
And yet she wol obeye of curteisye
 A wyf  is kepere of thyn housbondrye
  
Wel may the sike man  biwaille and wepe
Ther as ther is no wyf the hous to kepe
I warne thee  if wisly thow wolt wirche
Loue wel thy wyf as Crist loued his chirche
If thow louest thy self  thow louest thy wif
No man hateth his flessh  but in his lyf
He fostreth it and therfore bidde I thee
Cherisse thy wyf or thow shalt neuere thee
Housbonde and wyf what so men Iaye or pleye
Of worldly folk holden the siker weye
They been so knyt  ther may noon harm bityde
And namely  vp on the wyues syde
ffor which this Ianuarie  of whom I tolde
Considered hath  inwith his dayes olde
The lusty lyf  the vertuous quyete
That is in mariage  hony swete
And for his freendes  on a day he sente
To tellen hem  theffect of his entente
 With face sad  this tale he hath hem told
He seyde freendes  I am hoor and old
And almoost god woot on my pittes brynke  
Vp on my soule  som what moste I thynke
I haue my body  folily despended
Blissed be god  þat it shal been amended
ffor I wol be certeyn  a wedded man
And that anon  in al the haste I kan
Vn to som mayde  fair and tendre of age
I pray yow  shapeth for my mariage
Al sodeynly  for I wol nat abyde
And I wol fonde  tespien on my side
To whom I may  be wedded hastily
But for as muche  as ye been mo than I
Ye shullen rather  swich a thing espien
Than I  and where me beste were to allien
 But o thyng warne I yow  my freendes deere
I wol noon old wyf han  in no manere
  
She shal nat passe  xx yer certeyn
Old fissh  and yong flessh  wol I haue feyn
Bet is quod he  a Pyk  than a Pykerel
And bet than old boef  is the tendre vel
I wol no womman  xxxti yeer of age
It is but bene straw  and greet forage
And eek thise olde widwes  god it woot
They konne so muche craft on Wades boot
So muchel broken harm  whan hem leste
That with hem  sholde I neuere lyue in reste
ffor sondry scoles  maketh subtile clerkis
Womman of many scoles  half a clerk is
But certeinly  a yong thyng may men gye
Right as men may warm wex  with handes plye
Wherfore  I sey yow pleynly in a clause
I wol noon old wyf han  right for this cause
ffor if so were  I hadde swich meschaunce
That I in hire  ne koude han no plesaunce
Thanne sholde I lede my lyf  in avoutrye
And go streight to the deuel  whan I dye
Ne children sholde I none  vp on hir geten
Yet were me leuere  houndes hadde me eten
Than that myn heritage sholde falle
In straunge hand  and this I telle yow alle
ote nat I woot the cause why
Men sholde wedde  and ferther moore woot I
Ther speketh many a man of mariage
That woot namoore of it than woot my page
ffor whiche causes  man sholde take a wyf
If he ne may nat lyue  chast his lyf
Take hym a wyf with greet deuocion
By cause  of leueful procreacion
Of children  to thonour of god aboue
And nat oonly  for paramour or loue
And for they sholde  lecherye eschue
And yelde hir dette  whan þat it is due
  
Or for þat ech of hem  sholde helpen oother
In meschief as a Suster shal the brother
And lyue in chastitee  ful holily
But sires by youre leue  that am nat I
ffor god be thanked  I dar make auant
I feele my lymes  stark and suffisant
To do  al that a man bilongeth to
I woot my self best what I may do
 Thogh I be hoor  I fare as dooth a tree
That blosmeth  er the fruyt ywoxen be
And blosmy tree  nys neither drye ne deed
I feele me nowher hoor  but on myn heed
Myn herte  and alle my lymes  been as grene
As laurer thurgh the yeer is for to sene
And syn þat ye han herd  al myn entente
I pray yow  to my conseil ye wol assente
 Dyuerse men  diuersely hym tolde
Of mariage  manye ensamples olde
Somme blamed it somme preised it certeyn
But at the laste  shortly for to seyn
As alday  falleth altercacion
Bitwixe freendes  in disputison
Ther fil a stryf bitwix his bretheren two
Of whiche  that oon was clepid Placebo
Iustinus soothly  called was that oother
 Placebo seyde  o Ianuarie brother
fful litel nede  hadde ye my lord so deere
Conseil to axe  of any that is heere
But þat ye been  so ful of Sapience  
That yow ne liketh  for youre heigh prudence
To weyuen  fro the word of Salomon
This word seyde he  vn to vs euerichon
Werk alle thyng by conseil  thus seyde he
And thanne shaltow nat repenten thee
But thogh þat Salamon  spak swich a word
Myn owene deere brother  and my lord
  
So wisly  god my soule brynge at reste
I holde  your owene conseil is the beste
ffor brother myn  of me tak this motyf
I haue now been  a Court man al my lyf
And god it woot thogh I vnworthy be
I haue stonden  in ful greet degree
Abouten lordes  in ful greet estat
Yet hadde I neuere  with noon of hem debat
I neuere hem contraryed  trewely
I woot wel  þat my lord kan moore than I
What that he seith  I holde it ferm and stable
I seye the same  or ellis thyng semblable
A ful greet fool  is any conseillour
That serueth any lord  of heigh honour
That dar presume  or ellis thenken it
That his conseil  sholde passe his lordes wit
Nay  lordes be no fooles by my fay
Ye han your seluen  shewed heer to day
So heigh sentence  so holily and weel
That I consente  and conferme euery deel
Youre wordes alle  and youre opynyoun
By god  ther nys no man in al this toun
Ne in Ytaille  koude bet han ysayd
Crist halt hym of this conseil  ful wel apayd
And trewely  it is an heigh corage
Of any man  that stapen is an age
To take a yong wyf  by my fader kyn
Youre herte hangeth  on a iolyf pyn
Dooth now in this matere  right as yow leste
ffor fynally  I holde it for the beste
 Iustinus  that ay stille sat and herde
Right in this wise  he to Placebo answerde
w brother myn  be pacient I preye
yn ye han seyd  and herkneth what I seye
Senec amonges othere wordes wise
Seith  þat a man  oghte hym right wel auyse
  
To whom  he yeueth his lond  or his catel
And syn I oghte  auysen me right wel
To whom I yeeue my good  away fro me
Wel muchel moore  I oghte auysed be
To whom I yeeue my body  for alwey
I warne yow wel  it is no childes pley
To taken a wyf withouten auysement
Men moste enquere  this is myn assent
Wher she be wys and sobre  or dronkelewe
Or proud or ellis oother weys a shrewe
A chidester  or wastour of thy good
Or riche  or poure  or ellis mannyssh wood
Al be it so  þat no man fynden shal
Noon in this world  that trotteth hool in al
Ne man ne beest swich as men koude deuyse
But nathelees  it oghte ynogh suffise
With any wyf if so were þat she hadde
Mo goode thewes  than hir vices badde
And al this axeth leyser  for tenquere
ffor god it woot I haue wept many a teere
fful pryuely  syn þat I hadde a wyf
Preyse who so wole  a wedded mannes lyf
Certeyn I fynde in it but cost and care
And obseruances  of alle blisses bare
And yet god woot my neghebores aboute
And namely  of wommen many a route
Seyn þat I haue  the mooste stedefast wyf
And eek the mekeste  that bereth lyf
But I woot best where wryngeth me my sho
Ye mowe for me  right as yow liketh do
Auyseth yow  ye been a man of age
How þat ye entren  in to mariage
And namely  with a yong wyf and a feir
By him þat made water  erthe and Eir
The yongest man  þat is in al this route
Is bisy ynow  to bryngen it aboute
  
To han his wyf allone  trusteth me  
Ye shul nat plesen hire  fully yeres thre
This is to seyn  to doon hire ful plesance
A wyf axeth  ful many an obseruance
I pray yow  þat ye be nat yuele apayd
 Wel quod this Ianuarie  and hastow ysayd
Straw for thy Senec and for thy prouerbes
I counte nat a panyer ful of herbes
Of Scole termes  wiser man than thow
As thow hast herd  assenteden right now
To my purpos  Placebo what sey ye
 I seye  it is a cursed man quod he
That letteth matrymoigne sikerly
And with that word  they risen sodeynly
And been assented fully  that he sholde
Be wedded whan hym liste  and wher he wolde
 Heigh fantasie  and curious bisynesse
ffro day to day  gan in the soule impresse
Of Ianuarie  aboute his mariage
Many fair shape  and many a fair visage
Ther passeth thurgh his herte  nyght by nyght
As who so tooke a Mirour  polisshed bright
And sette it in a commune Market place
Thanne sholde he se  ful many a figure pace
By his Mirour  and in the same wise
Gan Ianuarie  in with his thoght deuyse
Of maydens  whiche þat dwelten hym bisyde
He wiste nat wher þat he myghte abyde
ffor if þat oon  haue beautee in hir face
Another stant so  in the peples grace
ffor hir sadnesse  and hir benygnytee
That of the peple  grettest voys hath she
And somme were riche  and hadden badde name
But nathelees  bitwene ernest and game
He atte laste  apoynted hym on oon
And leet alle othere  from his herte goon
  
And chees hire  of his owene auctoritee
ffor loue is blynd alday  and may nat see
And whan that he  was in his bed ybroght
He purtreyde  in his herte  and in his thoght
 fresshe beautee  and hir age tendre
ir myddel smal  hir armes longe and sklendre
Hir wise gouernance  hir gentilesse
Hir wommanly beryng and hir sadnesse
And whan þat he on hire  was condescended
Hym thoughte  his choys myghte nat ben amended
ffor whan þat he hym self concluded hadde
Hym thoughte  ech oother mannes wit was badde
That impossible  it weere to replye
Agayn his choys  this was his fantasie
 His freendes sente he to  at his instance
And preyde hem  to doon hym that plesance
That hastily  they wolden to hym come
He wolde abregge hir labour alle and some
Nedeth namoore  for hym to go ne ryde
He was apointed  ther he wolde abyde
 Placebo cam  and eek his freendes soone
And alderfirst he bad hem alle a boone
That noon of hem  none argumentes make
Agayn the purpos  which þat he hath take
Which purpos  was plesant to god seyde he
And verray ground  of his prosperitee
 He seyde  ther was a mayden in the toun
Which þat of beautee  hadde greet renoun
Al were it so  she were of smal degree
Suffiseth hym  hir youthe and hir beautee
Which mayde he seyde  he wolde han to his wyf
To lede in ese  and holynesse his lyf
And thanked god  þat he myghte han hire al
That no wight his blisse parten shal
And preyde hem  to labouren in this nede
And shapen  þat he faille nat to spede
  
ffor thanne he seyde  his Spirit was at ese
Thanne is quod he  no thyng may me displese
Saue o thyng priketh in my conscience
The which I wol reherce in youre presence
 I haue quod he herd seyd  ful yoore ago
Ther may no man  han parfite blisses two
This is to seye  in erthe and eek in heuene
ffor thogh he kepe hym  fro the synnes seuene
And eek from euery branche  of thilke tree  
Yet is ther  so parfit felicitee
And so greet ese  and lust in mariage
That euere I am agast now in myn age
That I shal lede now  so murye a lyf
So delicat with outen wo and stryf
That I shal han myn heuene  in erthe heere
ffor sith þat verray heuene  is boght so deere
With tribulacions  and greet penance
How sholde I thanne  that lyue in swich plesance
As alle wedded men  doon with hir wyuys
Come to the blisse  that Crist eterne on lyue is
This is my drede  and ye my bretheren tweye
Assoileth me  this question I preye
 Iustinus which þat hated his folye
Answerde anon  right in his iaperye
And for he wolde  his longe tale abregge
He wolde  noon auctoritee allegge
But seide sire  so ther be noon obstacle
Oother than this  god of his hye myracle
And of his mercy  may so for yow werche
That er ye haue  your right of holy cherche
Ye may repente  of wedded mannes lyf
In which ye seyn  ther is no wo ne stryf
And ellis god forbede  but he sente
A wedded man  hym grace to repente
Wel ofte  rather than a sengle man
And ther fore sire  the beste reed I kan
  
Dispeire yow noght but haue in youre memorie
Paraunter  she may be youre purgatorie
She may be goddes mene  and goddes whippe
Thanne shal your soule  vp to heuene skippe
Swifter  than dooth an arwe  out of a bowe
I hope to god  heer after ye shul knowe
That ther nys  noon so greet felicitee
In mariage  ne neuere mo shal be
That yow shal lette  of youre saluacion
So that ye vse  as skile is and reson
The lustes of youre wyf  attemprely
And þat  ye plese hire  nat to amorously
d that ye kepe yow eek  from oother synne
My tale is doon  for my wit is thynne
Beth nat agast herof  my brother deere
But lat vs waden  out of this matere
The wyf of Bathe  if ye han vnderstonde
Of mariage  which we han on honde
Declared hath ful wel  in litel space
ffareth now wel  god haue yow in his grace
 And with that word  this lustyn and his brother
Han take hir leue  and ech of hem of oother
ffor whan they sawe  þat it moste nedes be
They wroghten so  by sly  and wys tretee
That she this mayden  which that Mayus highte
As hastily  as euer þat she myghte
Shal wedded be  vn to this Ianuarie
 I trowe  it were to longe yow to tarye
If I yow tolde  of euery scrit and bond
By which  þat she was feffed  in his lond
Or for to herknen  of hir riche array
But finally  ycomen is that day
That to the chirche  bothe be they went
ffor to receyue  the holy sacrament
 fforth comth the preest with stoole aboute his nekke
And bad hire be lyk  Sarra and Rebekke
  
In wisdom  and in trouthe of mariage
And seyde his orisons  as is vsage
And croucheth hem  and bad  god sholde hem blesse
And made al siker ynow  with holynesse
 Thus been they wedded  with solempnitee
And at the laste  sitteth he and she
With oother worthy folk  vp on the deys
Al ful of ioye and blisse  is the paleys
And ful of Instrumentz  and of vitaille
The mooste deynteuous  of al Ytaille
Biforn hem stoode swiche Instrumentz of swich soun
That Orpheus  nof Thebes Amphioun
Ne maden neuere  swich a melodye
At euery cours  thanne cam loud mynstralcye
That neuere tromped  Ioab  for to heere
Ne he Theodomas  yet half so cleere
At Thebes  whan the Citee was in doute  
Bacus  the wyn hem shenketh al aboute
And Venus laugheth  vp on euery wight
ffor Ianuarie  was bicome hir knyght
And wolde  bothe assayen his corage
In libertee  and eek in mariage
And with hir firbrond  in hir hand aboute
Daunceth bifore the bryde  and al the route
And certeinly  I dar right wel seye this
Ymeneus  that god of weddyng is
Say neuere his lyf  so murye a wedded man
Hoold thow thy pees  thou Poete Marcian
That writest vs  that ilke weddyng murye
Of hire Philologie  and he Mercurie
And of the songes  that the Muses songe
To smal  is bothe thy penne  and eek thy tonge
ffor to discryuen  of this mariage
Whan tendre youthe  hath wedded stoupyng age
Ther is swich murthe  that it may nat be writen
Assayeth it your self than may ye witen
  
If that I lye or noon  in this matere
 Mayus that sit with so benygne a cheere
Hir to biholde  it semed ffairye
Queene Ester  looked neuere with swich an eye
On Assuer  so meke a look hath she
I may yow nat deuyse  al hir beautee
But thus muche  of hir beautee  telle I may
That she was lyk the brighte morwe of May
ffulfild  of alle beautee and plesaunce
 This Ianuarie  is rauysshed in a traunce
At euery tyme  he looked on hir face
But in his herte  he gan hir to manace
That he that nyght in armes wolde hir streyne
Harder than euere  Parys dide Eleyne
But nathelees  yet hadde he gret pitee
That thilke nyght offenden hire moste he
And thoghte allas  o tendre creature
Now wolde god  ye myghte wel endure
Al my corage  it is so sharpe and kene
I am agast ye shul it nat sustene
 god forbede  that I dide al my myght
Now wolde god  that it were woxen nyght
And þat the nyght wolde laste euere mo
I wolde  that al this peple were ago
And fynally  he dooth al his labour
As he best myghte  sauyng his honour
To haste hem fro the mete  in subtil wise
The tyme cam  þat reson was to rise
And after that men daunce  and drynken faste
And Spices  al aboute the hous they caste
And ful of ioye and blisse  is euery man
Al but a Squyer  highte Damyan
Which carf biforn the knyght ful many a day
He was so rauysshed  on his lady May
That for the verray peyne  he was ny wood
Almoost he swelte  and swowned as he stood
  
So sore hath Venus  hurt hym with hir brond
As that she baar it dauncyng in hir hond
And to his bed  he wente hym hastily
Namoore of hym  at this tyme speke I
But ther I lete hym  wepe ynow and pleyne
Til fresshe May  wol rewen on his peyne
 O perilous fyr  that in the bed straw bredeth
O famulier foo  that his seruice bedeth
O seruant traytour  false homly hewe
Lyk to the Neddre in bosom  sly vntrewe
God shilde vs alle  from youre aqueyntance
O Ianuarie  dronken in plesance
In mariage  se how thy Damyan
Thyn owene Squyer  and thy born man
Entendeth  for to do thee vileynye
God grante thee  thyn homly fo espye
ffor in this world  nys worse pestilence
Than homly fo  alday in thy presence
 Parfourned hath the sonne  his Ark diurne
No lenger  may the body of hym soiurne
On thorisonte  as in that latitude
Night with his mantel  that is derk and rude
Gan ouersprede  Themysperies aboute
ffor which  departed is  this lusty route
ffor Ianuarie  with thank on euery syde  
Hom to hir houses  lustily they ryde
Wher as they doon hir thynges  as hem leste
And whan they say hir tyme  go to reste
 Soone after þat this hasty Ianuarie
Wol go to bedde  he wol no lenger tarie
He drynketh Ypocras  Clarree and Vernage
Of Spices hoote  tencressen his corage
And many a letuarie  hadde he ful fyn
Swich as the cursed Monk daun Constantyn
Hath writen  in his book De coitu
To eten hem alle  he nas no thyng eschu
  
And to his pryuee freendes  thus seyde he
ffor goddes loue  as soone as it may be
Lat voyden al this hous  in curteis wise
And they han doon  right as he wol deuyse
Men drynken  and the trauers drawe anon
The bryde was broght a bedde  as stille as stoon
And whan the bed  was with the preest yblessed
Out of the chambre  hath euery wight hym dressed
And Ianuarie  hath faste in armes take
His fresshe May  his Paradys  his make
He lulleth hire  he kisseth hire  ful ofte
With thilke bristles  of his berd vnsofte
Lyk to the Skyn of houndfyssh  sharpe as brere
ffor he was shaue al newe  in his manere
He rubbeth hire  aboute hir tendre face
And seyde thus  allas I moot trespace
To yow my Spouse  and yow gretly offende
Er tyme come  þat I wol doun descende
But natheles  considereth this quod he
Ther nys no werkman  what so euere he be
That may bothe  werke wel and hastily
This wol be doon  at leyser parfitly
It is no fors  how longe þat we pleye
In trewe wedlok coupled be we tweye
And blessed be the yok  þat we been Inne
ffor in  actes  we mow do no synne
A man  may do no synne with his wyf
Ne hurte hym seluen  with his owene knyf
 we han leue  to pleye vs by the lawe

hus laboureth he  til that the day gan dawe
And thanne  he taketh a sope in fyn Clarree
And vp right in his bed  thanne sitteth he
And after that he song ful loude and clere
And kiste his wyf  and made wantown cheere
He was al coltyssh  ful of ragerye
And ful of Iargon  as a flekked pye
  
The slakke skyn  aboute his nekke shaketh
Whil þat he song so chaunteth he and craketh
But god woot what þat may thoghte in hir herte
Whan she hym saw  vp sittyng in his sherte
In his nyght cappe  and with his nekke lene
She preiseth nat his pleyyng worth a bene
Thanne seyde he thus  my reste wol I take
Now day is come  I may no lenger wake
And doun he leyde his heed  and sleepe til pryme
And afterward  whan þat he saw his tyme
Vp riseth Ianuarie  but fresshe May
Heeld hir chambre  vn to the fourthe day
As vsage is of wyues  for the beste
ffor euery labour  som tyme moot han reste
Or ellis  longe may he nat endure
This is to seyn  no lyues creature
Be it fissh  or bryd  or beest or man
Now wol I speke  of woful damyan
That langwissheth for loue  as ye shul heere
Ther fore  I speke to hym  in this manere
 I seye  o sely Damyan allas
Answere to my demaunde  as in this cas
How shaltow  to thy lady fresshe May
Telle thy wo  she wol alwey sey nay
Eek if thow speke  she wol thy wo biwreye
God be thyn helpe  I kan no bettre seye
This syke damyan  in Venus fyr
So brenneth  that he dyeth for desyr
ffor which  he putte his lyf in auenture
No lenger myghte he  in this wise endure
But priuely  a penner gan he borwe
And in a lettre  wroot he al his sorwe
In manere of a compleynt or a lay  
Vn to his faire  fresshe lady May
And in a purs of sylk heng on his sherte
He hath it put and leyd it at his herte
  
 The moone þat at Noon  was thilke day
That Ianuarie  hath wedded fresshe May
In two of Taur  was in to Cancre gliden
So longe hath Mayus  in hir chambre abyden
As custume is  vn to thise nobles alle
A bryde  shal nat eten in the halle
Til dayes foure  or thre dayes atte leeste
Ypassed ben  thanne lat hir go to feste
 The fourthe day complet fro noon to noon
Whan þat the heighe masse  was ydoon
In halle  sit this Ianuarie and May
As fressh  as in the brighte Someres day
And so bifel  how that this goode man
Remembred hym  vp on this Damyan
And seyde  Seynte Marie how may it be
That Damyan  entendeth nat to me
Is he ay syk  or how may this bityde
 Hys Squyers  whiche þat stooden ther bisyde
Excused hym  by cause of his siknesse
Which letted hym  to doon his bisynesse
Noon oother cause  myghte make hym tarye
 That me forthynketh  quod this Ianuarye
He is a gentil Squyer  by my trouthe
If þat he deyde  it were harm and routhe
He is as wys  discret and eek secree
As any man  I woot of his degree
And therto manly  and eek seruysable
And for to be a thrifty man  right able
But after mete  as soone as euere I may
I wol my self visite hym  and eek May
To do hym  al the confort þat I kan
And for that word  hym blessed euery man
That of his bountee  and his gentilesse
He wolde so  conforten in siknesse
His Squyer  for it was a gentil dede
 Dame quod this Ianuarie  tak good hede
  
ter mete  ye with youre wommen alle
an ye han ben in chambre  out of this halle
hat alle ye go  to this Damyan
Dooth hym disport he is a gentil man
And telleth hym  þat I wol hym visite
Haue I no thyng but rested me a lite
And spede yow faste  for I wol abide
Til that ye slepe  faste by my syde
And with that word  he gan to hym to calle
A Squier  that was Marchal of his halle
And tolde hym certein thynges  what he wolde
 This fresshe May  hath streight hir wey yholde
With alle hir wommen  vn to Damyan
Doun by his beddes syde  sit she than
Confortyng hym  as goodly as she may
 This Damyan  whan þat his tyme he say
In secree wise  his purs and eek his bille
In which  þat he ywriten hadde his wille
Hath put in to hir hand  with oute moore
Saue þat he siketh  wonder depe and soore
And softely to hire  right thus seyde he
Mercy  and þat ye nat discouere me
ffor I am deed  if þat this thyng be kyd
This purs hath she  in with hir bosom hyd
And wente hir wey  ye gete namoore of me
But vn to Ianuarie  ycomen is she
That on his beddes syde  sit ful softe
And taketh hire  and kisseth hire ful ofte
And leyde hym doun to slepe  and that anon
She feyned hire  as þat she moste gon
Ther as ye woot that euery wight moot nede
And whan she of this bille  hath taken hede
She rente it al to cloutes  at the laste
And in the pryuee  softely it caste
 Who studieth now  but faire fresshe May
Adoun  by olde Ianuarie she lay
  
That sleepe  til þat the coghe hath hym awaked
Anon he preyde  strepen hire al naked
He wolde of hire he seyde  han som plesance
He seyde  hir clothes  dide hym encombrance
And she obeyeth  be hir lief or looth  
But lest þat precious folk  be with me wrooth
How þat he wroghte  I dar nat to yow telle
Or wheithir  it thoughte Paradys  or helle
But heere I lete hem werken  in hir wise
Til euensong rong and þat they moste arise
Were it by destynee  or by auenture
Were it by Influence  or by nature
Or constellacion  that in swich estat
The heuene stood  that tyme fortunat
As for to putte a bille  of Venus werkes
ffor alle thyng hath tyme  as seyn thise clerkes
To any womman  for to gete hir loue
I kan nat seye  but grete god aboue
That knoweth  þat noon Act is causelees
He deme of al  for I wol holde my pees
 But sooth is this  how þat this fresshe May
Hath taken  swich impression that day
Of pitee  on this syke Damyan
That from hir herte  she ne dryue kan
The remembrance  for to doon hym ese
Certeyn thoghte she  whom þat this thyng displese
I rekke nat for here I hym assure
To loue hym best of any creature
Thogh he namoore hadde  than his sherte
Loo  pitee renneth soone  in gentil herte
 Heere may ye se  how excellent franchise
In wommen is  whan they hem narwe auyse
Som tirant is  as ther be many oon
That hath an herte  as hard as is a stoon
Which wolde  han leten steruen  in the place
Wel rather  than han graunted hym hir grace
  
And hem reioysen  in hir cruel pryde
And rekke nat to been an homycide
 This gentil May  fulfilled of pitee
Right of hir hand  a lettre maked she
In which she graunteth hym  hir verray grace
Ther lakketh noght oonly  but day and place
Wher that she myghte  vn to his lust suffise
ffor it shal be  right as he wol deuyse
 whan she saw hir tyme  vp on a day  
 visite this Damyan  goth May
And subtilly  this lettre doun she threste
Vnder his pilwe  rede it if hym leste
She taketh hym by the hand  and harde hym twiste
So secrely  that no wight of it wiste
And bad hym be al hool  and forth she wente
To Ianuarie  whan þat he for hir sente
 Vp riseth Damyan  the nexte morwe
Al passed was  his siknesse and his sorwe
He kembeth hym  he prayneth hym and pyketh
He dooth  al that his lady lust and lyketh
And eek to Ianuarie  he goth as lowe
As euer dide  a dogge for the bowe
He is so plesant vn to euery man
ffor craft is al  who so þat do it kan
That euery wight is fayn to speke hym good
And fully  in his ladyes grace he stood
Thus lete I Damyan  aboute his nede
And in my tale  forth I wol procede
 Somme clerkes  holden þat felicitee
Stant in delit and therfore certeyn he
This noble Ianuarie  with al his myght
In honeste wise  as longeth to a knyght
Shoope hym to lyue  ful deliciously
His housyng his array  as honestly
To his degree  was maked  as a kynges
Amonges othere  of his honeste thynges
  
He made a gardyn  walled al with stoon
So fair a gardyn  woot I nowher noon
ffor out of doute  I verraily suppose
That he  þat wroot the Romance of the Rose
Ne koude of it the beautee wel deuyse
Ne Priapus  ne myghte nat suffise
Thogh he be god of gardyns  for to telle
The beautee  of the gardyn and the welle
That stood vnder a laurer  alwey grene
fful ofte tyme  he Pluto and his queene
Proserpina  and al hir ffairye
Disporten hem  and maken melodye
Aboute that welle  and daunced as men tolde  
This noble knyght this Ianuarie the olde
Swich deyntee hath  in it to walke and pleye
That he wol no wight suffre bere the keye
Saue he hym self for of the smal wyket
He bar alwey  of siluer a Clyket
With which  whan þat hym leste  he it vnshette
And whan he wolde  paye his wyf hir dette
In somer seson  thider wolde he go
And May his wyf and no wight but they two
And thynges  whiche þat were nat doon abedde
He in the gardyn  parfourned hem and spedde
And in this wise  many a murye day
Lyued this Ianuarie  and fresshe May
But worldly ioye  may nat alwey dure
To Ianuarie  ne to no creature
 O sodeyn hape  o thow ffortune vnstable
Lyk to the Scorpion  so deceyuable
That flaterest with thyn heed  whan thow wolt stynge
Thy tayl is deeth  thurgh thyn enuenymynge
O brotil ioye  o swete venym queynte
O Monstre  that so subtilly kanst peynte
Thy yiftes  vnder hewe of stedefastnesse
That thow deceyuest bothe moore and lesse
  
Why hastow Ianuarie  thus deceyued
That haddest hym  for thy fulle freend receyued
And now thow hast biraft hym  bothe his eyen
ffor sorwe of which  desireth he to dyen
Allas  this noble Ianuarie free
Amydde his lust and his prosperitee
Is woxen blynd  and that al sodeynly
He wepeth  and he waileth pitously
And ther with al  the fyr of Ialousye
Lest that his wyf sholde falle in som folye
So brente his herte  þat he wolde fayn
That som man  bothe hire and hym had slayn
ffor neither after his deeth  ne in his lyf
Ne wolde he  þat she were loue ne wyf
But euere lyue as wydwe  in clothes blake
Soul as the turtle  that lost hath hir make
t atte laste  after a Monthe or tweye  
is sorwe gan aswage  sooth to seye
ffor whan he wiste  it may noon oother be
He paciently  took his aduersitee
Saue out of doute  he may nat forgoon
That he nas Ialous  euere moore in oon
Which Ialousye  it was so outrageous
That neither in halle  ne in noon oother hous
Ne in noon oother place  neuer the mo
He nolde suffre hire  for to ryde or go
But if þat he  hadde hond on hir alway
ffor which ful ofte  wepeth fresshe May
That loueth Damyan  so benygnely
That she moot outher dyen sodeynly
Or ellis  she moot han hym as hir leste
She wayteth  whan hir herte wolde breste
 Vp on that oother syde  Damyan
Bicomen is  the sorwefulleste man
That euere was  for neither nyght ne day
Ne myghte he speke a word to fresshe May
  
As to his purpos  of no swich matere
But if þat Ianuarie  moste it heere
That hadde an hand  vp on hire euere mo
But nathelees  by writyng to and fro
And pryuee signes  wiste he what she mente
And she knew eek  the fyn of his entente
 O· Ianuaire  what myghte it thee auaille
Thow myghtest se  as fer as Shippes saille
ffor as good  is blynd deceyued be
As to be deceyued  whan a man may se
Lo Argus  which þat hadde an hundred eyen
ffor al that euere  he koude poure or pryen
Yet was he blent and god woot so been mo
That weneth wisly  that it be nat so
Passe ouer is an ese  and sey namoore
 This fresshe May  that I spak of so yoore
In warm wex  hath printed the Clyket
That Ianuarie bar  of that smale wyket
By which  in to his gardyn  ofte he wente
And Damyan  that knew al his entente
The Clyket countrefeted pryuely  
Ther nys namoore to seye  but hastily
Som wonder  by this Cliket shal bityde
Which ye shal heren  if ye wol abyde
 O noble Ouyde  wel sooth seistow god woot
What sleighte is it thogh it be long and hoot
That he nel fynde it out in som manere
By Pyramus and Thesbe  may men lere
Thogh they were kept ful longe  streyte ouer al
They been acorded  rownyng thurgh a wal
Ther no wight koude  han founde out swich a sleighte
But now to purpos  er that dayes eighte
Were passed  er the Monthe of Iuyl bifille
That Ianuarie  hath caught so greet a wille
Thurgh eggyng of his wyf hym for to pleye
In his gardyn  and no wight but they tweye
  
That in a morwe  vn to his May seith he
Rys vp my wyf my loue  my lady free
The Turtles voys is herd  my dowue swete
The wynter is goon  with reynes wete
Com forth now  with thyne eyen Columbyn
How fairer been thy brestes  than is wyn
The gardyn  is enclosed al aboute
Com forth my white spouse  out of doute
Thow hast me wounded in myn herte  O wyf
No spot of thee  ne knew I al my lyf
Com forth  and lat vs taken oure desport
I chees thee  for my wyf and my confort
 Swiche olde lewed wordes  vsed he
On Damyan  a signe made she
That he sholde go biforn  with his Clyket
This Damyan thanne  hath opned the wyket
And in he stirte  and that in swich manere
That no wight myghte it se  neither yheere
And stille he sit  vnder a bussh anon
 This Ianuarie  as blynd as is a stoon
With Mayus in his hand  and no wight mo
In to his fresshe gardyn  is ago
And clapte to  the wyket sodeynly
Now wyf quod he  here nys but thow and I
at art the creature  that I best loue
ffor by that lord  that sit in heuene aboue
Leuere ich hadde  to dyen on a knyf
Than thee offende  trewe deere wyf
ffor goddes sake  thenk how I thee chees
Noght for no coueitise doutelees
But oonly  for the loue I hadde to thee
And thogh þat I be old  and may nat see
Beth to me trewe  and I wol telle yow why
Thre thynges certes  shal ye wynne ther by
 ffirst loue of Crist and to your self honour
And al myn heritage  toun and tour
  
I yeue it yow  maketh chartres as ye leste
This shal be doon to morwe  er sonne reste
So wisly  god my soule  brynge in blisse
I pray yow first in couenant ye me kisse
And thogh þat I be Ialous  wyt me noght
Ye been so depe  emprinted in my thoght
That whan þat I  considere youre beautee
And ther with al  the vnlikly elde of me
I may noght certes  thogh I sholde dye
fforbere  to been out of youre compaignye
ffor verray loue  this is with outen doute
Now kys me wyf and lat vs rome aboute
 This fresshe May  whan she thise wordes herde
Benygnely  to Ianuarie answerde
But first and forward  she bigan to wepe
I haue quod she  a soule for to kepe
As wel as ye  and also myn honour
And of my wifhod  thilke tendre flour
Which þat I haue  assured in youre hond
Whan þat the preest to yow my body bond
Wher fore  I wol answere in this manere
By the leue of yow  my lord so deere
I pray to god  þat neuere dawe the day
That I ne sterue  as foule as womman may
If euere I do  vn to my kyn that shame
Or ellis  I empeyre so my name
That I be fals  and if I do that lakke
Do strepe me  and put me in a sakke
And in the nexte Ryuer  do me drenche  
I am a gentil womman  and no wenche
Why speke ye thus  but men been euere vntrewe
And wommen haue reproue  of yow ay newe
Ye han  noon oother contenance I leue
But speke to vs  of vntrust and repreue
 And with that word  she saw wher Damyan
Sat in the bussh  and coghen she bigan
  
And with hir fynger  signes made she
That Damyan  sholde clymbe vp on a tree
That charged was with fruyt and vp he wente
ffor verraily  he knew al hir entente
And euery signe  þat she koude make
Wel bet than Ianuarie  hir owene make
ffor in a lettre  she hadde told hym al
Of this matere  how he werken shal
And thus I lete hym sitte  vp on the purye
And Ianuarie and May  romynge murye
 Bright was the day  and blew the firmament
Phebus hath of gold  his stremys doun ysent
To gladen euery flour  with his warmnesse
He was that tyme  in Geminis as I gesse
But litil  fro his declynacion
Of Cancer  Iouis exaltacion
And so bifel  that brighte morwe tyde
That in that gardyn  in the ferther syde
Pluto  that is the kyng of ffairye
And many a lady  in his compaignye
ffolwynge his wyf  the queene Proserpyne

2Whos answere hath doon many a man pyne2
 Whil that she gadrede  floures in the mede
In Claudyan  ye may the stories rede
How in his grysly Carte  he hir sette
This kyng of ffairye  thanne adown hym sette
Vp on a bench of turues  fressh and grene
And right anon  thus seyde he to his queene
 My wyf quod he  ther may no wight sey nay
Thexperience  so proueth euery day
The treson  which þat womman dooth to man
Ten hundred thousand  tellen I kan
otable  of youre vntrouthe and brotelnesse  
O Salomon wys  and richest of richesse
ffulfild of Sapience  and of worldly glorie
fful worthy been thy wordes  to memorie
  
To euery wight that wit and reson kan
Thus preyseth he yet the bontee of man
 Amonges a thousand men  yet foond I oon
But of wommen alle  foond I noon
 Thus seith the kyng þat knoweth youre wikkednesse
And Ihesus filius Syrak as I gesse
Ne speketh of yow  but selde reuerence
A wilde fyr  and corrupt pestilence
So falle vp on youre bodyes  yet to nyght
Ne se ye noght this honurable knyght
By cause allas  þat he is blynd and old
His owene man  shal make hym Cokewold
Lo where he sit the lechour in the tree
Now wol I graunten  of my magestee
Vn to this olde  blynde worthy knyght
That he shal haue ayein  his eyen syght
Whan þat his wyf wolde doon hym vileynye
Thanne shal he knowen  al hir harlotrye
Bothe in repreue of hire  and othere mo
 Ye shal quod Proserpyne  wol ye so
Now by my modres sires soule  I swere
That I shal yeuen hire  suffisant answere
And alle wommen after  for hir sake
That thogh they be  in any gilt ytake
With face bold  they shul hem self excuse
And bere hem doun  that wolde hem accuse
ffor lakke of answere  noon of hem shal dyen
Al hadde man seyn a thyng with bothe his eyen
Yet shal we wommen  visagen it hardily
And wepe and swere  and chide subtilly
So that ye men  shul been as lewed as gees
What rekketh me  of youre auctoritees
 I woot wel  þat this Iew  this Salomon
ffand of vs wommen  folyes many oon
But thogh þat he  ne fand no good womman
Yet hath ther founde  many another man
  
Wommen ful trewe  ful goode and vertuous  
Witnesse on hem  that dwelle in Cristes hous
With martirdom  they proued hir constaunce
The Romayn geestes  eek maken remembraunce
Of many a verray  trewe wyf also
But sire ne be nat wrooth  al be it so
Thogh þat he seyde  he foond no good womman
I pray yow  taak the sentence of the man
He mente thus  þat in souerayn bontee
Nys noon but god  but neither he ne she
 Ey for verray god  that nys but oon
What make ye  so muche of Salomon
What thogh  he made a temple goddes hous
What thogh he were riche and glorious
So made he eek a temple  of false goddys
How myghte he do a thyng þat moore forbode is
Pardee  as faire  as ye his name emplastre
He was a lechour  and an ydolastre
And in his elde  he verray god forsook
And if god ne hadde  as seith the book
Yspared hym  for his fadres sake  he sholde
Haue lost his regne  rather than he wolde
I sette right noght of al the vileynye
That ye of wommen write  a Boterflye
I am a womman  nedes moot I speke
Or ellis swelle  til myn herte breke
ffor sithen he seyde  þat we been Iangleresses
As euere hool  I mote brouke my tresses
I shal nat spare  for no curteisye
To speke hym harm  þat wolde vs vileynye
 Dame quod this Pluto  be no lenger wrooth
I yeue it vp  but sith I swoor myn ooth
That I wolde graunten hym  his sighte ayein
My word shal stonde  I warne yow certeyn
I am a kyng it sit me noght to lye
 And I quod she  a queene of ffairye
  
Hir answere shal she haue  I vndertake
Lat vs namoore wordes  her of make
ffor sothe  I wol no lenger yow contrarie
 Now lat vs  turne agayn to Ianuarie
at in the gardyn  with his faire May
Syngeth ful murier  than the Papeiay
Yow loue I best and shal and oother noon
So longe  aboute the Aleyes is he goon
Til he was come  agayns thilke pirye
Wher as this Damyan  sitteth ful myrye
An heigh  among the fresshe leues grene
 This fresshe May  that is so bright and shene
Gan for to syke  and seyde allas my syde
Now sire quod she  for aught þat may bityde
I moste han  of the perys þat I se
Or I moot dye  so sore longeth me
To eten  of the smale perys grene
Help for hir loue  þat is of heuene queene
I telle yow wel  a womman in my plit
May han to fruyt so gret an appetit
That she may dyen  but she of it haue
 Allas quod he  þat I ne hadde here a knaue
That koude clymbe  allas allas quod he
ffor I am blynd  ye sire no fors quod she
 But wolde ye  vouche sauf  for goddes sake
The pirye inwith youre armes  for to take
ffor wel I woot þat ye mystruste me
Thanne sholde I clymbe  wel ynow quod she
So I my foot myghte sette vp on youre bak
 Certes quod he  ther on shal be no lak
Mighte I yow helpen  with myn herte blood
He stoupeth doun  and on his bak she stood
And caughte hir by a twiste  and vp she goth
Ladys I pray yow  þat ye be nat wroth
I kan nat glose  I a rude man
And sodeynly  anon this Damyan
  
Gan pullen vp the smok  and in he throng
 And whan þat Pluto  saugh this grete wrong
To Ianuarie  he yaf agayn his sighte
And made hym see  as wel as euere he myghte
And whan that he  hadde caught his sighte agayn
Ne was ther neuere man  of thyng so fayn
But on his wyf his thoght was euere mo
Vn to the tree  he caste his eyen two
And say þat Damyan  his wyf had dressed  
In swich manere  it may nat ben expressed
But if I wolde speken  vncurteisly
And vp he yaf a roryng and a cry
As dooth the moder  whan the child shal dye
Out help  allas  harrow  he gan to crye
O stronge lady stoore  what dostow
 And she answerde  sire what eyleth yow
Haue pacience and reson  in youre mynde
I haue yow holpe  on bothe youre eyen blynde
Vp peril of my soule  I shal nat lyen
As me was taught to heele with youre eyen
Was no thyng bet to make yow to se
Than strugle with a man  vp on a tree
God woot I dide it in ful good entente
 Strugled quod he  ye algate In it wente
God yeue yow bothe  on shames deth to dyen
He swyued thee  I saw it with myne eyen
And ellis  be I hanged by the hals
 Thanne is quod she  my medicyne al fals
ffor certeinly  if þat ye myghte se
Ye wolde nat seyn  thise wordes vn to me
Ye han som glymsynge  and no parfit sighte
 I se quod he  as wel as euere I myghte
Thonked be god  with bothe myne eyen two
And by my trouthe  me thoughte he dide thee so
 Ye maze maze  goode Sire quod she
This thank haue I  for I haue maad yow se
  
Allas quod she  þat euere I was so kynde
Now dame quod he  lat al passe out of mynde
Com doun my lief and if I haue myssayd
God help me so  as I am yuele apayd
But by my fadres soule  I wende haue seyn
How þat this Damyan  hadde by thee leyn
And þat thy Smok  hadde leyn vp on his bryst
 Ye sire quod she  ye may wene as yow lyst
But sire  a man that waketh out of his sleepe
He may nat sodeynly  wel taken keepe
Vp on a thyng ne seen it parfitly
Til that he be  adawed verraily
ht so a man  that longe hath blynd ybe
e may nat sodeynly  so wel yse
ffirst whan his sighte  is newe come ageyn
As he þat hath  a day or two yseyn
Til þat youre sighte  ysatled be a while
Ther may ful many a sighte yow bigile
Beth war I pray yow  for by heuene kyng
fful many a man  weneth to se a thyng
And it is al another  than it semeth
He þat mysconceyueth  he mysdemeth
And with that word  she lepte doun fro the tree
 This Ianuarie  who is glad but he
He kisseth hire  and clippeth hire ful ofte
And on hir wombe  he stroketh hire ful softe
And to his Palays  hom he hath hire lad
Now goode men  I pray yow to be glad
Thus endeth here  my tale of Ianuarie
God blesse vs  and his moder Seinte Marie  Amen  
Ey goddes mercy  seyde oure Hoost tho
Now swich a wyf  I prey god kepe me fro
Lo whiche sleightes  and subtiltees
In wommen ben  for ay as bisy as bees
Ben they  vs sely men for to deceyue
And from a sooth  euere wol they weyue
By this Marchantes tale  it preueth weel
But doutelees  as trewe as any steel
I haue a wyf  thogh þat she poore be
But of hir tonge  a labbyng shrewe is she
And yit she hath  an heep of vices mo
Therof no fors  lat alle swiche thynges go
But wite ye what in conseil be it seyd
Me reweth soore  I am vn to hire teyd
ffor and I sholde  rekenen euery vice
Which þat she hath  ywis I were to nyce
And cause why  it sholde reported be
And toold to hire  of somme of this meynee
Of whom  it nedeth nat for to declare
Syn wommen  konnen oute swich chaffare
And eek my wit suffiseth nat ther to
To tellen al  wherfore my tale is do  
 Sire ffrankeleyn  com neer if it youre wille be
And sey vs a tale  for certes ye
konnen ther on  as muche as any man
 Nay sire quod he  but I wol seye as I kan
ith hertly wyl  for I wol nat rebelle
Agayns youre wyl  a tale wol I telle
Haue me excused  if þat I speke amys
My wyl is good  and lo my tale is this
THise olde gentil Britons  in hir dayes
Of diuerse auentures  maden layes
Rymeyed  in hir firste Briton tonge
Whiche layes  with hir Instrumentz they songe
Or ellis redden hem  for hire plesance
And oon of hem  haue I in remembrance
Which I shal seyn  with good wyl as I kan
 But sires  by cause I am a burel man
At my bigynnyng first I yow biseche
Haue me excused  of my rude speche
I lerned neuere  Rethorik certeyn
Thyng þat I speke  It moot be bare and pleyn
I sleepe neuere  in the Mount of Parnaso  
Ne lerned  Marcus Tullius Scithero
Colours ne knowe I none  with outen drede
But swiche colours  as growen in the mede
Or ellis swiche  as men dye  or peynte
Colours of Rethoryk they ben to queynte
My Spirit feeleth nat of swich matere
But if yow list my tale shul ye heere
IN Armorik that called is Britayne
Ther was a knyght þat louede and dide his payne
To serue a lady  in his beste wise
And many a labour  many a gret emprise
  
He for his lady wroghte  er she were wonne
ffor she was  oon the faireste vnder Sonne
And eek ther to  come of so heigh kynrede
That wel vnnethes  dorste this knyght for drede
Telle hire his wo  his peyne  and his distresse
But atte laste  she for his worthynesse
And namely  for his meke obeysance
Hath swich a pitee caught of his penance
That priuely  she fel of his acord
To taken hym  for hir housbonde and hir lord
Of swich lordshipe  as men han ouer hir wyues
And for to lede  the moore in blisse hir lyues
Of his fre wyl  he swoor hire as a knyght
That neuere in al his lyf he day ne nyght
Ne sholde vp on hym take  no maistrye
Agayn hir wyl  ne kothe hire Ialousye
But hire obeye  and folwe hir wyl in al
As any louere  to his lady shal
Saue  þat the name of soueraynetee
That wolde he haue  for shame of his degree
 She thonked hym  and with ful gret humblesse
She seyde sire  sith of youre gentillesse
Ye profre me  to haue so large a reyne
Ne wolde neuere god  bitwix vs tweyne
As in my gilt were outher werre  or stryf
Sire I wol be  youre humble trewe wyf
Haue heer my trouthe  til that myn herte breste
Thus been they bothe  in quiete and in reste
 o thyng sires  saufly dar I seye
hat freendes  euerich oother moote obey
If they wol longe holden compaignye
Loue wol nat be constreyned by maistrye
Whan maistrie comth  the god of loue anon
Beteth his wynges  and farwel he is gon
Loue is a thyng as any spirit free
Wommen of kynde  desiren libertee
  
And nat to been constreyned  as a thral
And so doon men  if I sooth seyn shal
Looke  who þat moost is pacient in loue
He is  at his auantage al aboue
Pacience  is an heigh vertu certeyn
ffor it venquysseth  as thise clerkes seyn
Thynges  that rigour sholde neuere atteyne
ffor euery word  men may nat chide or pleyne
Lerneth to suffre  or ellis so moot I gon
Ye shul it lerne  wher so ye wole or non
ffor in this world  certeyn ther no wight is
That he ne dooth  or seith som tyme amys
Ire  siknesse  or constellacion
Wyn  wo  or chaungyng of complexion
Causeth ful ofte  to doon amys or speken
On euery wrong a man may nat be wreken
After the tyme  moste be temperaunce
To euery wight þat kan on gouernaunce
And therfore  hath this wise worthy knyght
To lyue in ese  suffrance hire bihight
And she to hym  ful wisly gan to swere
That neuere  sholde ther be defaute in here
 Here may men seen  an humble wys acord
Thus hath she take  hir seruant and hir lord
Seruant in loue  and lord in mariage
Thanne was he bothe  in lordshipe and seruage
Seruage nay  but in lordshipe aboue
Sith he hath  bothe his lady and his loue
His lady certes  and his wyf also
The which  þat lawe of loue acordeth to
And whan he was  in this prosperitee
Hom with his wyf he gooth to his contree
Nat fer fro Pedmark ther his dwellyng was  
Wher as he lyueth  in blisse and in solas
 Who koude telle  but he hadde wedded be
The ioye  the ese  and the prosperitee
  
That is  bitwix an housbonde  and his wyf
A yeer and moore  lasted this blisful lyf
Til þat the knyght of which I speke of thus
That of Kairrud  was clepid Arueragus
Shoope hym to goon  and dwelle a yeer or twayne
In Engelond  that clepid was ek Britayne
To seke in armes  worshipe and honour
ffor al his lust he sette in swich labour
And dwelled ther two yeer  the book seith thus
 Now wol I stynte  of this Arueragus
And speke I wole  of Dorigene his wyf
That loueth hir housbonde  as hir hertes lyf
ffor his absence  wepeth she and siketh
As doon thise noble wyues  whan hem liketh
She moorneth  waketh  waileth  fasteth  pleyneth
Desir of his presence  hir so destreyneth
That al this wide world  she set at noght
Hir freendes whiche þat knowe  hir heuy thoght
Conforten hire  in al that euer they may
They prechen hire  they telle hire nyght and day
That causelees  she sleeth hir self allas
And euery confort possible in this cas
They doon to hire  with al hir bisynesse
Al for to make hire  leue hir heuynesse
 By proces  as ye knowen euerichoon
Men may so longe  grauen in a stoon
Til som figure  ther Inne emprinted be
So longe  han they conforted hire  til she
Receyued hath  by hope and by reson
The emprintyng of hir consolacion
Thurgh which  hir grete sorwe gan aswage
She may nat alwey  duren in swich rage
 And eek Arueragus  in al this care
Hath sent hire lettres hom  of his welfare
And that he wole  come hastily agayn
Or ellis hadde this sorwe  hir herte slayn
  
 freendes sawe hir sorwe gan to slake
d preyde hire on knees  for goddes sake
To come  and romen hire in compaignye
Awey to dryue  hir derke fantasye
And finally  she graunted that requeste
ffor wel she saw  þat it was for the beste
 Now stood hir Castel  faste by the See
And often  with hir freendes walketh she
Hir to disporte  vp on the bank an heigh
Wher as she  many a Shipe and Barge seigh
Seillynge hir cours  wher as hem liste go
But thanne was that a parcel of hir wo
ffor of hir self ful ofte allas seith she
Is ther no shipe  of so manye as I se
Wol bryngen hom my lord  thanne were myn herte
Al warisshed  of hise bittre peynes smerte
 Another tyme  there wolde she sitte and thynke
And caste hir eyen  downward fro the Brynke
But whan she seigh  the grisly Rokkes blake
ffor verray fere  so wolde hir herte quake
That on hir feet she myghte hir noght sustene
Thanne wolde she  sitte adoun vp on the grene
And pitously  in to the See biholde
And seyn right thus  with sorweful sikes colde
 Eterne god  that thurgh thy purueiance
Ledest the world  by certeyn gouernance
In ydel as men seyn  ye no thyng make
But lord  thise grisly  feendly Rokkes blake
That semen rather  a foul confusion
Of werk  than any fair creacion
Of swich a parfit wys god and a stable
Why han ye wroght this werk vnresonable
ffor by this werk South  North  ne west ne Est
Ther nys yfostred  man  ne bryd  ne beest
It doth no good to my wit but anoyeth
Se ye nat lord  how mankynde it destroyeth
  
An hundred thousand bodies  of mankynde
Han Rokkes slayn  al be they nat in mynd
Which mankynde  is so fair part of thy werk
That thow it madest lyk to thyn owen merk
Thanne semed it ye hadde a greet chiertee  
Toward mankynde  but how thanne may it be
That ye swiche menes make  it to destroyen
Whiche menes do no good  but euere anoyen
I woot wel  clerkes wol seyn as hem leste
By argumentz  that al is for the beste
Thogh I ne kan  the causes nat yknowe
But thilke god  þat made wynd to blowe
As kepe my lord  this my conclusion
To clerkes  lete I al disputison
But wolde god  þat alle thise Rokkes blake
Were sonken in to helle  for his sake
Thise Rokkes sleen myn herte  for the feere
Thus wolde she seyn  with many a pitous teere
 Hir freendes sawe  that it was no disport
To romen by the See  but disconfort
And shopen  for to pleyen  som wher ellys
They leden hire  by Ryuers and by wellys
And eek in othere places delitables
They dauncen  and they pleyen at Ches and tables
 So on a day  right in the morwe tyde
Vn to a gardyn  that was ther bisyde
In which  that they hadde maad hir ordinance
Of vitaille  and of oother purueiance
They goon and pleye hem  al the longe day
And this was  on the sixte morwe of May
Which may hadde peynted  with his softe shoures
This gardyn  ful of leues  and of floures
And craft of mannes hond  so curiously
Arrayed hadde  this gardyn trewely
That neuere was ther gardyn  of swich prys
But if it were  the verray Paradys
  
The odour of floures  and the fresshe sight
Wolde han maked  any herte lighte
That euere was born  but if to greet siknesse
Or to greet sorwe  helde it in destresse
So ful it was  of beautee with plesaunce
At after dyner  gonne they to daunce
And synge also  saue Dorigen allone
Which made alwey  hir compleynt and hir mone
r she ne saugh hym  on the daunce go
That was hir housbonde  and hir loue also
But nathelees  she moste a tyme abyde
And with good hope  lete hir sorwe slyde
 Vp on this daunce  amonges othere men
Daunced a Squier  bifore Dorigen
That fressher was  and Iolier of array
As to my doom  than is the Monthe of May
He syngeth  daunceth  passyng any man
That is  or was  sith þat the world bigan
Ther with he was  if men sholde hym discryue
Oon of the beste farynge man  on lyue
Yong strong right vertuous  and riche and wys
And wel biloued  and holden in gret prys
And shortly  if the sothe I tellen shal
Vnwityng of this Dorigen at al
This lusty Squier  seruant to Venus
Which  that yclepid was Aurelius
Hadde loued hire  best of any creature
Two yeer and moore  as was his auenture
But neuere dorste he tellen hire  his greuance
With outen coppe  he drank al his penance
He was despeyred  no thyng dorste he seye
Saue in his songes  som what wolde he wreye
His wo  as in a general compleynyng
He seyde he louede  and was biloued no thyng
Of which matere  made he many layes
Songes  compleyntes  roundels  vyrelayes
  
How þat he dorste nat his sorwe telle
But langwissheth  as a fuyre dooth in helle
And dye he moste he seyde  as dide Ekko
ffor Narcisus  that dorste nat telle hir wo
In oother manere  than ye heere me seye
Ne dorste he nat to hire  his wo biwreye
Saue that parauenture  som tyme at daunces
Ther yong folk  kepen hir obseruaunces
It may wel be  he looked on hir face
In swich a wise  as man þat asketh grace
But no thyng wiste she  of his entente
Nathelees it happed  er they thennes wente
 By cause  that he was  hir neghebour  
And was a man  of worshipe and honour
And hadde yknowen hym  of tyme yoore
They fille in speche  and forth moore and moore
Vn to this purpos  drough Aurelius
And whan he saugh his tyme  he seyde thus
 Madame quod he  by god that this world made
So þat I wiste  it myghte youre herte glade
I wolde that day  þat youre Arueragus
Wente ouer the See  that I Aurelius
Hadde went ther neuere I sholde haue come agayn
ffor wel I woot my seruyce is in vayn
My gerdon is  but brestyng of myn herte
Madame reweth  vp on my peynes smerte
ffor with a word  ye may me sle or saue
Here at youre feet god wolde þat I were graue
I ne haue as now  no leyser moore to seye
Haue mercy swete  or ye wol do me deye
 She gan to looke  vp on Aurelius
Is this youre wil quod she  and sey ye thus
Neuere erst quod she  ne wiste I what ye mente
But now Aurelie  I knowe youre entente
By thilke god  that yaf me soule and lyf
Ne shal I neuere  been vntrewe a wyf
  
In word ne werk as fer as I haue wyt
I wol been hys  to whom þat I am knyt
Taak this for fynal  as of me
But after that in pleye thus seyde she
 Aurelie quod she  by heighe god aboue
Yet wolde I graunte yow  to been youre loue
Syn I yow se  so pitously complayne
Looke what day  þat endelong Britayne
Ye remoeue alle the Rokkes  stoon by stoon
That they ne lette  shipe ne Boot to goon
I seye  whan ye han maad  the coost so clene
Of Rokkes  that ther nys no stoon ysene
Thanne wol I loue yow  best of any man
Haue heer my trouthe  in al that euere I kan
 Is ther noon oother grace  in yow quod he
 No by that lord quod she  that maked me
 wel I woot that it shal neuere bityde
at swiche folies  out of youre herte slyde
What deyntee  sholde a man han his lyf
ffor to loue  another mannes wyf
That hath hir body  whan so that hym liketh
 Aurelius  ful ofte soore siketh
Wo was Aurelie  whan þat he this herde
And with a sorweful herte  he thus answerde
 Madame quod he  this were an inpossible
Thanne moot I dye  of sodeyn deth horrible
And with that word  he turned hym anon
Tho coome  hir othere freendes many oon
And in the Aleyes  romeden vp and doun
And no thyng wiste  of this conclusioun
But sodeynly  bigonne reuel newe
Til that the brighte sonne  loste his hewe
ffor thorisonte  hath reft the Sonne his light
This is as muche to seye  as it was nyght
And hom they goon  in ioye and in solas
Saue oonly  wrecched Aurelius allas
  
He to his hous is goon  with sorweful herte
He seeth  he may nat from his deeth asterte
Hym semed  that he felte his herte colde
Vp to the heuene  hise hondes he gan holde
And on his knowes bare  he sette hym doun
And in his rauynge  seyde his orisoun
ffor verray wo  out of his wit he breyde
He nyste what he spak but thus he seyde
With pitous herte  his pleynt hath he bigonne
Vn to the goddes  and first vn to the sonne
 He seyde Appollo  god and gouernour
Of euery plaunte  herbe  tree  and flour
That yeuest after thy declynacion
To ech of hem  his tyme and his seson
As thyn herberwe  chaungeth  lowe or heighe
Lord Phebus  cast thy merciable eighe
On wrecche Aurelie  which þat am but lorn
Lo lord  my lady hath my deeth ysworn
With outen gilt but thy benygnytee
Vp on my dedly herte  haue som pitee
ffor wel I woot lord Phebus  if yow lest  
Ye may me helpen  saue my lady best
Now voucheth sauf  þat I may yow deuyse
How þat I may been holpe  and in what wyse
 Youre blisful Suster  lueyna the shene
That of the See  is chief goddesse and queene
Thogh Neptunus  haue deitee in the See
Yet Empiresse  abouen hym is she
Ye knowen wel lord  that right as hir desir
Is  to be quyked  and lighted of youre fyr
ffor which  she folweth yow  ful bisily
Right so the See  desireth naturelly
To folwen hire  as she þat is goddesse
Bothe in the See  and Ryuers moore and lesse
Wherfore lord Phebus  this is my requeste
Do this myracle  or do myn herte breste
  
That now next at this opposicion
Which in the signe  shal be of the Lion
As preyeth hire  so greet a flood to brynge
That fyue fadme at the leeste  it ouer sprynge
The hyeste Rok in Armoryk Britayne
And lat this flood  endure yeris twayne
Thanne certes  to my lady  may I seye
Holdeth youre heste  the Rokkes been aweye
 Lord Phebus  dooth this myracle for me
Pray hire  she go no faster cours than ye
I seye this  prayeth youre Suster  þat she go
No faster cours than ye  thise yeris two
Thanne shal she been euene  at the fulle alway
And spryng flood lasten  bothe nyght and day
And but she vouche sauf in swich manere
To graunte me  my souerayn lady deere
Pray hire  to synken euery Rok adown
In to  hir owene dirke Regioun
Vnder the ground  ther Pluto dwelleth Inne
Or neuere mo  shal I my lady wynne
Thy temple in Delphos  wol I barfoot seke
Lord Phebus  Se the teerys on my cheke
And of my peyne  haue som compassioun
And with that word  in swowne he fil adoun
 longe tyme  he lay forth in a traunce
is brother  which that knew of his penaunce
Vp caughte hym  and to bedde he hath hym broght
Despeired  in this torment and this thoght
Lete I  this woful creature lye
Chese he for me  wher he wol lyue or dye
 Arueragus  with heele  and greet honour
As he þat was  of Chiualrie the flour
Is comen hom  and othere worthy men
O blisful artow now  thow dorigen
That hast thy lusty housbonde  in thyn armes
The fresshe knyght the worthy man of armes
  
That loueth thee  as his owene hertes lyf
No thyng list hym  to been ymagynatyf
If any wight hadde spoke  whil he was oute
To hire of loue  he ne hadde of it no doute
He noght entendeth  to no swich matere
But daunceth  Iusteth  maketh hir good cheere
And thus in ioye and blisse  I lete hem dwelle
And of the Syke Aurelius  wol I telle
 In langour  and in torment furyus
Two yeer and moore  lay wrecche Aurelius
Er any foot he myghte on erthe gon
Ne confort in this tyme  hadde he non
Saue of his brother  which þat was a Clerk
He knew of al this wo  and al this werk
ffor  to noon oother creature certeyn
Of this matere  he dorste no word seyn
Vnder his brist he baar it moore secree
Than euere dide Panfilus  for Galathee
His brist was hool  with oute for to sene
But in his herte  ay was the arwe kene
And wel ye knowe  þat of a Sursanure
In Surgerye  is perilous the cure
But men myghte touche the arwe  or come therby
His brother  weepe and wayled pryuely
Til at the laste  hym fil in remembrance
That whils he was  in Orliens in ffrance
As yonge clerkes  that been lykerous
To reden Artes  that been curious
Seken  in euery halke  and euery herne  
Particuler Sciences  for to lerne
He hym remembred  þat vp on a day
At Orliens in Studie  a book he say
Of Magyk naturel  which his felawe
That was that tyme  a Bachiler of lawe
Al were he ther  to lerne another craft
Hadde priuely  vp on his desk ylaft
  
Which book spak muchel  of the operacions
Touchynge  the xxviij mansions
That longen to the Moone  and swich folye
As in oure dayes  is nat worth a flye
ffor holy chirches feith  in oure bileue
Ne suffreth  noon illusion vs to greue
And whan this book was in his remembrance
Anon for ioye  his herte gan to dance
And to hym self  he seyde pryuely
My brother  shal be warisshed hastily
ffor I am siker  þat ther be sciences
By whiche  men make diuerse apparences
Swiche  as thise subtile  Tregettours pleye
ffor ofte at festes  haue I wel herd seye
That Tregettours  with Inne an halle large
Haue maad come In  a water  and a barge
And in the halle  rowen vp and doun
Som tyme hath semed  come a grym leoun
And som tyme floures sprynge  as in a mede
Som tyme a vyne  and grapes white and rede
Som tyme a Castel  al of lym and Stoon
And whan hem lyked  voyded it anoon
Thus semed it to euery mannes sighte
 Now thanne conclude I thus  þat if I myghte
At Orliens  som old felawe yfynde
That hadde  this Moones mansions in mynde
Or oother Magyk naturel aboue
He sholde wel  make my brother han his loue
ffor with an apparence  a clerk may make
To mannes sighte  þat alle the Rokkes blake
Of Britaigne  were yvoyded euerichon
And Shippes  by the brynke  comen and gon
 in swich forme  enduren a day or two
Thanne were my brother  warisshed of his wo
Thanne moste she nedes  holden hir biheste
Or ellis  he shal shame hire  at the leeste
  
 What sholde I make  a lenger tale of this
Vn to his brotheres bed  he comen is
And swich confort he yaf hym for to gon
To Orliens  that he vp stirte anon
And on his wey forthward  thanne he is fare
In hope  for to been lissed of his care
 Whan they were come  almoost to that Citee
But if it were  a two furlong or thre
A yong clerk  romynge by hym self they mette
Which þat in latyn  thriftily hem grette
And after that he seyde a wonder thyng
I knowe quod he  the cause of youre comyng
And er they ferther  any foote wente
He tolde hem  al that was in hir entente
 This Briton clerk hym asked of felawes
The whiche þat he hadde knowe  in olde dawes
And he answerde hym  þat they dede were
ffor which  he weepe ful ofte many a teere
 Doun of his hors  Aurelius lighte anon
And with this Magicien  forth he is gon
Hom to his hous  and maden hem wel atese
Hem lakked no vitaille  þat myghte hem plese
So wel arrayed hous  as ther was oon
Aurelius in his lyf  saw neuere noon
 He shewed hym  er he wente to soper
fforestes  Parkes  ful of wilde deer
Ther saw he hertes  with hir hornes hye
The gretteste  þat euere were seyn with eye
He say of hem  an hundred slayn with houndes
And somme with arwes blede  of bittre woundes
 He saw  whan voyded were thise wilde deer
Thise ffawconers  vp on a fair Ryuer
That with hir hawkes  han the heron slayn
 Tho saugh he knyghtes  Iustyng in a playn
And after this  he dide hym this plesaunce
That he hym shewed  his lady on a daunce
  
On which hym self  he daunced as hym thoughte  
And whan this maister  þat this magyk wroughte
Saugh it was tyme  he clapte his handes two
And farwel  al our reuel was ago
And yet remoeued they neuere  out of the hous
Whil they sawe  al this sighte merueillous
But in his studie  ther as his bookes be
They sitten stille  and no wight but they thre
 To hym this maister  called his Squyer
And seide hym thus  is redy oure soper
Almoost an houre it is  I vndertake
Sith I yow bad  oure soper for to make
Whan that thise worthy men  wenten with me
In to my studie  ther as my bookes be
 Sire quod this Squyer  whan it liketh yow
It is al redy  thogh ye wol right now
Go we thanne soupe quod he  as for the beste
This amorous folk som tyme mote han hir reste
 At after soper  fille they in tretee
What somme sholde  this Maistres gerdon be
To remoeuen  alle the Rokkes of Britayne
And eek from Gerounde  to the mouth of Sayne
He made it straunge  and swoor so god hym saue
Lasse than a thousand pound  he wolde nat haue
Ne gladly for that somme  he wolde nat gon
 Aurelius  with blisful herte anon
Answerde thus  fy on a thousand pound
This wyde world  which þat men seye is round
I wolde it yeue  if I were lord of it
This bargayn is ful dryue  for we ben knyt
Ye shal be payed trewely  by my trouthe
But looketh now  for no necligence or slouthe
Ye tarie vs heer  no lenger than tomorwe
 Nay quod this clerk haue heer my feith to borwe
 To bedde is goon Aurelius  whan hym leste
And wel neigh al that nyght he hadde his reste
  
What for his labour  and his hope of blisse
His woful herte  of penaunce hadde a lisse
 Vp on the morwe  whan þat it was day
To Britayne  tooke they the righte way
elius  and this Magicien bisyde  
And been descended  ther they wolde abyde
And this was  as thise bookes me remembre
The colde  frosty seson of decembre
 Phebus wax old  and hewed lyk laton
That in his hote declynacion
Shoon as the burned gold  with stremys brighte
But now in Capricorn  adoun he lighte
Where as he shoon ful pale  I dar wel seyn
The bittre frostes  with the sleet and reyn
Destruyed hath the grene  in euery yerd
Ianus sit by the fyr  with double berd
And drynketh  of his bugle horn the wyn
Biforn hym stant brawen  of the tusked swyn
And Nowel  crieth euery lusty man
 Aurelius  al þat euere he kan
Dooth to this maister  cheere and reuerence
And preyeth hym  to doon his diligence
To bryngen hym  out of his peynes smerte
Or with a swerd  þat he wolde slytte his herte
 This subtil clerk swich routhe hadde of this man
That nyght and day  he spedde hym that he kan
To wayten a tyme  of his conclusion
This is to seyn  to make illusion
By swich an apparence  or Iogelrye
I ne kan  no termes of Astrologye
That she and euery wight sholde wene and seye
That of Britayne  the Rokkes were aweye
Or ellis  were sonken vnder grounde
So at the laste  he hath his tyme yfounde
To maken his Iapes  and his wrecchednesse
Of swich  a supersticious cursednesse
  
His tables tolletanes  forth he broght
fful wel corrected  ne ther lakked noght
Neither his collect ne his expans yeris
Ne hise rootes  ne hise othere geris
As been his centris  and hise argumentz
And hise proporcionels conuenientz
ffor hise equacions  in euery thyng
And by his 8 speere  in his wirkyng
He knew ful wel  how fer Alnath was shoue  
ffro the heed  of thilke fixe Aries aboue
That in the 9 speere  considered is
fful subtilly he kalkuled al this
 Whan he hadde founde  his firste mansion
He knew the remenaunt by proporcion
And knew the arisyng of his Moone wel
And in whos face  and terme  and euery del
And knew ful wel  the Moones mansion
Acordaunt  to his operacion
And knew also  hise othere obseruaunces
ffor swiche illusions  and swiche meschances
As hethen folk vseden  in thilke dayes
ffor which no lenger  maked he delayes
But thurgh his magyk for a wyke or tweye
It semed that alle the Rokkes were aweye
 Aurelius  which þat yet despeired is
Wher he shal han his loue  or fare amys
Awaiteth nyght and day  on this myracle
And whan he knew  that ther was noon obstacle
That voyded were  thise Rokkes euerichon
Doun to his maistres feet he fil anon
And seyde  I woful wrecche Aurelius
Thonke yow lord  and lady myn Venus
That me han holpen  fro my cares colde
And to the temple  his wey forth hath he holde
Wher as he knew  he sholde his lady se
And whan he saw his tyme  anon right he
  
With dredful herte  and with ful humble cheere
Salued hath  his souerayn lady deere
 My righte lady  quod this woful man
Whom I moost drede  and loue as I best kan
And lothest were  of al this world displese
Nere it þat I for yow haue swich disese
That I moste dyen heer at youre foot anon
Noght wolde I telle yow  how me is wo bigon
But certes  outher moste I dye  or pleyne
Ye sleen me giltlees  for verray peyne
But of my deeth  thogh þat ye haue no routhe
Auyseth yow  er that ye breke your trouthe
teth yow  for thilke god aboue
Er ye me sleen  by cause that I yow loue 
ffor madame  wel ye woot what ye han hight
Nat þat I chalange  any thyng of right
Of yow my souereyn lady  but youre grace
But in a gardyn yond  at swich a place
Ye woot right wel  what ye bihighten me
And in myn hand  your trouthe plighten ye
To loue me best god woot ye seyden so
Al be  þat I vnworthy am ther to
Madame I speke it  for the honour of yow
Moore than to saue  myn hertes lyf right now
I haue do so  as ye comaunded me
And if ye vouche sauf  ye may go se
Dooth as yow list haue youre biheste in mynde
ffor quyk or deed  right ther ye shal me fynde
In yow lyth al  to do me lyue or deye
But wel I woot the Rokkes been aweye
 He taketh his leue  and she astoned stood
In al hir face  nas a drope of blood
She wende neuere haue come  in swich a trappe
Allas quod she  þat euere this sholde happe
ffor wende I neuere  by possibilitee
That swich a Monstre  or merueille myghte be
  
It is agayns  the proces of nature
And hom she gooth  a sorweful creature
ffor verray feere  vnnethe may she go
She wepeth  wayleth  al a day or two
And swowneth  that it routhe was to se
But why it was  to no wight tolde she
ffor out of towne  was goon Arueragus
But to hir self she spak and seyde thus
With face pale  and with ful sorweful cheere
In hir compleinte  as ye shal after heere
 Allas quod she  on thee ffortune I pleyne
That vnwar  wrapped hast me in thy cheyne
ffor which tescape  woot I no socour
Saue oonly  deeth  or deshonour
Oon of thise two  bihoueth me to chese
But nathelees  yet haue I leuere to lese
My lyf  than of my body to haue a shame  
Or knowen my seluen fals  or lese my name
And with my deeth  I may be quyt ywis
Hath ther nat many a noble wyf er this
And many a mayde  yslayn hir self allas
Rather  than with hir body doon trespas
 Yis certes  lo thise stories beren witnesse
Whan xxx tirauntz  ful of cursednesse
Hadde slayn Phidon  in Atthenes atte feste
They comaunded  his doghtren for tareste
And bryngen hem  biforn hem in despit
Al naked  to fulfille hir foul delit
And in hir fadres blood  they made hem daunce
Vp on the pauement god yeue hem meschaunce
ffor which  thise woful maydens  ful of drede
Rather  than they wolde lese hir maydenhede
They pryuely  been stirt in to a welle
And dreynte hem seluen  as the bokes telle
 They of Mecene  leete enquere and seke
Of Lacedomye  fifty maydens eke
  
On whiche  they wolden doon hir lecherye
But was ther noon  of al that compaignye
That she nas slayn  and with a good entente
Chees rather for to dye  than assente
To been oppressed  of hir maydenhede
Why sholde I thanne  to dye been in drede
 Loo eek  the tiraunt Aristoclides
That loued a mayden  highte Stymphalides
Whan þat hir fader  slayn was on a nyght
Vn to Dianes temple  gooth she right
And hente the ymage  in hir handes two
ffro which ymage  wolde she neuere go
No wight ne myghte  hir handes of it arace
Til she was slayn  right in the selue place
Now sith þat maydens  hadden swich despit
To been defouled  with mannes foul delit
Wel oghte a wyf rather hir seluen sle
Than be defouled  as it thynketh me
 What shal I seyn  of Hasdrubales wyf
That at Cartage  birafte hir self hir lyf
 whan she saw  that Romayns wan the town
he took hir children alle  and skipte adown
In to the fyr  and chees rather to dye
Than any Romayn  dide hire vileynye
 Hath nat Lucresse  yslayn hir self allas
At Rome  whan she oppressed was
Of Tarquyn  for hir thoughte it was a shame
To lyuen  whan she hadde lost hir name
 The vij maydens  of Milesie also
Han slayn hem self for verray drede and wo
Rather than folk of Gawle  hem sholde oppresse
Mo than a thousand stories  as I gesse
Koude I now telle  as touchyng this matere
 Whan habradace was slayn  his wyf so deere
Hir seluen slow  and leet hir blood to glyde
In Habradaces woundes  depe and wyde
  
And seyde  my body  at the leeste way
Ther shal no wight defoulen if I may
 What sholde I mo ensamples  her of sayn
Sith that so manye  han hem seluen slayn
Wel rather  than they wolde defouled be
I wol conclude  that it is bet for me
To sleen my self than ben defouled thus
I wol be trewe  vn to Arueragus
Or rather sle my self in som manere
As dide  democienis doghter deere
By cause  þat she wolde nat defouled be
 O Cedasus  it is ful gret pitee
To reden  how thy doghtren deyde allas
That slowe hem self for swich maner cas
 As greet a pitee was it or wel moore
The Theban mayden  that for Nychanore
Hir seluen slow  right for swich manere wo
 Another Theban mayden  dide right so
ffor oon of Macedonye  hadde hire oppressed
She with hir owene deeth  hir maydenhed redressed
 What shal I seyn  of Nyceratis wyf
That for swich cas  birafte hir self hir lyf
 How trewe eek  was to Alcebiades
His loue  that rather for to dyen chees
Than for to suffre  his body vnburyed be  
 Lo which a wyf  was Alceste quod she
 What Omer  of goode Penolopee
Al Grece  knoweth of hir chastitee
 Pardee of Laodomya  is writen thus
That whan at Troye  was slayn Protheselaus
No lenger wolde she lyue  after his day
 The same  of noble Porcia telle I may
With oute Brutus  koude she nat lyue
To whom she hadde  al hool hir herte yeue
 The parfit wifhod  of Arthemesye
Honoured is  thurgh al the Barbarye
  
 O Teuta queene  thy wifly chastitee
To alle wyues  may a Mirour bee

    
 Thus pleyned Dorigene  a day or tweye
Purposynge euere þat she wolde deye
 But nathelees  vp on the thridde nyght
Hom cam Arueragus  this worthy knyght
And asked hire  why þat she weepe so soore
And she gan wepen  euer lenger the moore
 Allas quod she  þat euere was I born
Thus haue I seyd quod she  thus haue I sworn
And tolde hym al  as ye han herd bifore
It nedeth nat reherce it yow namoore
 This housbond with glad cheere  in frendly wise
Answerde and seyde  as I shal yow deuyse
 Is ther oght ellis dorigen  but this
 Nay nay quod she  god help me so as wys
This is to muche  and it were goddes wille
 Ye wyf quod he  lat slepen that is stille
It may be wel perauenture  yet to day
Ye shul youre trouthe holden  by my fay
ffor god so wisly  haue mercy vp on me
I hadde wel leuere  ystiked for to be
ffor verray loue  which þat I to yow haue
But if ye sholde  youre trouthe kepe and saue
Trouthe is the hyeste thyng þat man may kepe
But with that word  he brast anon to wepe
And seyde I yow forbede  vp peyne of deeth
That neuere whil thee lasteth  lyf ne breeth
 wight tel thow  of this auenture
 I may best  I wol my wo endure
Ne make  no contenance of heuynesse
That folk of yow  may demen harm or gesse
 And forth he clepyd  a Squyer and a mayde
Goth forth anon with Dorigen  he sayde
  
And bryngeth hire  to swich a place anon
They toke hir leue  and on hir wey they gon
But they ne wiste  why they thider wente
He nolde to no wight tellen his entente

    
    
    
    
    
 This Squyer  which þat highte Aurelius
On Dorigen  þat was so amorus
Of auenture  happed hir to meete
Amydde the town  right in the quykkest strete
As she was boun  to goon the wey forth right
Toward the gardyn  ther as she had hight
And he was  to the gardynward also
ffor wel he spyed  whan she wolde go
Out of hir hous  to any maner place
But thus they meete  of auenture or grace
And he salueth hire  with glad entente
And asked of hire  whiderward she wente
 And she answerde  half as she were mad
Vn to the gardyn  as myn housbond bad
My trouthe for to holde  allas  allas
 Aurelius  gan wondren on this cas
And in his herte  hadde greet compassion
Of hire  and of hir lamentacion
And of Arueragus  the worthy knyght
That bad hir holden  al that she had hight
So looth hym was  his wyf sholde breke hir trouthe
And in his herte  he caughte of this greet routhe
Considerynge the beste  on euery syde
That fro his lust yet were hym leuere abyde
Than doon so heigh  a cherlyssh wrecchednesse
Agayns franchise  and alle gentillesse
  
ffor which in fewe wordes  seyde he thus
 Madame  seyeth to youre lord Arueragus
That sith I se  his grete gentillesse
To yow  and eek I se wel youre distresse
That hym were leuere han shame  and that were routhe  
Than ye to me  sholde breke thus your trouthe
I haue wel leuere  euere to suffre wo
Than I departe the loue  bitwix yow two
I yow relesse madame  in to youre hond
Quyt euery serement and euery bond
That ye han maad to me  as her biforn
Sith thilke tyme  which þat ye were born
My trouthe I plighte  I shal you neuer repreue
Of no biheeste  and here I take my leue
As of the treweste  and the beste wyf
That euere yet I knew  in al my lyf
But euery wyf  be war of hir biheste
On Dorigene  remembreth at the leste
Thus kan a Squyer  doon a gentil dede
As wel as kan a knyght with outen drede
 She thonketh hym  vp on hir knees al bare
And hom vn to hir housbond  is she fare
And tolde hym al  as ye han herd me sayd
And be ye siker  he was so wel apayd
That it were inpossible  me to write
What sholde I lenger  of this cas endite
 Arueragus  and Dorigene his wyf
In souereyn blisse  leden forth hir lyf
Neuere eft ne was ther angre hem bitwene
He cherisseth hire  as thogh she were a queene
And she was to hym trewe  for euere moore
Of thise two folk ye gete of me namoore
 Aurelius  that his cost hath al forlorn
Curseth the tyme  that euere he was born
Allas quod he  allas that I bihighte
Of pured gold  a thousand pound of wighte
  
Vn to this Philosophre  how shal I do
I se namoore  but that I am fordo
Myn heritage  moot I nedes selle
And been a beggere  here may I nat dwelle
And shamen al my kynrede  in this place
But I of hym  may gete bettre grace
But nathelees  I wol of hym assaye
At certeyn dayes  yeer by yeer to paye
 thonke hym  of his grete curteisye
y trouthe wol I kepe  I nel nat lye
 With herte soor  he gooth vn to his cofre
And broghte gold  vn to this Philosophre
The value  of fyue hundred pound I gesse
And hym bisecheth  of his gentillesse
To graunten hym dayes  of the remenant
And seyde Maister  I dar wel make auant
I fayled neuere  of my trouthe as yit
ffor sikerly  my dette shal be quyt
Towardes yow  how euere þat I fare
To goon abegged  in my kirtel bare
But wolde ye vouche sauf vp on seuretee
Two yeer or thre  for to respiten me
Thanne were I wel  for ellis moot I selle
Myn heritage  ther is namoore to telle
 This Philosophre  sobrely answerde
And seyde thus  whan he thise wordes herde
Haue I nat holden couenant vn to thee
 Yis certes  wel and trewely quod he
 Hastow nat had  thy lady as thee liketh
 No no quod he  and sorwefully he siketh
 What was the cause  tel me if thow kan
 Aurelius  his tale anon bigan
And tolde hym al  as ye han herd bifore
It nedeth nat to yow reherce it moore
 He seyde  Arueragus  of gentillesse
Hadde leuere dye  in sorwe and in distresse
  
Than þat his wyf were of hir trouthe fals
The sorwe of dorigen  he tolde hym als
How looth hir was  to ben a wikked wyf
And þat she leuere had lost that day hir lyf
And þat hir trouthe  she swoor thurgh Innocence
She neuere erst hadde herd speke  of apparence
That made me han of hire  so greet pitee
And right as frely  as he sente hir me
As frely sente I hire  to hym agayn
This al and som  ther is namoore to sayn
 This Philosophre answerde  leeue brother
Euerich of yow  dide gentilly til oother
Thow art a Squyer  and he is a knyght  
But god forbede  for his blisful myght
But if a clerk koude doon a gentil dede
As wel as any of yow  it is no drede
 Sire I relesse thee  thy thowsand pound
As thow right now  were cropen out of the ground
Ne neuere er now  ne haddest knowen me
ffor sire  I wol nat take a peny of thee
ffor al my craft ne noght for my trauaille
Thow hast ypayed wel  for my vitaille
It is ynogh  and fare wel haue good day
And took his hors  and forth he goth his way
 Lordynges  this question  than wol I aske now
Which was the mooste free  as thynketh yow
Now telleth me  er that ye ferther wende
I kan namoore  my tale is at an ende  
THe Ministre  and the norice vn to vices
Which that men clepeth in englissh ydelnesse
That porter at the gate is  of delices
To eschuen  and by hir contrarie hire oppresse
That is to seyn  by leueful bisynesse
Wel oghte we  to doon al oure entente
Lest that the feend  thurgh ydelnesse vs hente
 ffor he  that with his thousand cordes slye
Continuelly  vs wayteth to biclappe
Whan he may man  in ydelnesse espye
He kan so lightly  cacche hym in his trappe
Til that a man  be hent right by the lappe
He nys nat war  the feend hath hym in honde
Wel oghte vs werche  and ydelnesse withstonde
 And thogh men dradden  neuere for to dye
Yet seen men wel  by reson doutelees
That ydelnesse  is roten slogardye
Of which ther neuere comth  no good nencrees
And seen that Slouthe  hir holdeth in a lees
Oonly for to slepe  and ete and drynken
And to deuouren  al that othere swynken
  
 And for to putte vs  from swich ydelnesse
That cause is  of so greet confusion
I haue here doon  my feithful bisynesse
After the legende  in translacion
Right of thy glorious lyf and passion
Thow with thy gerland  wroght of rose and lilie

And thow  that flour of virgines art alle
Of whom that Bernard  list so wel to write
To thee  at my bigynnyng I first calle
Thow confort of vs wrecches  do mendite

As man may after  reden in hir Storie
 Thow mayde and moder  doghter of thy sone  
Thow welle of mercy  synful soules cure
In whom that god  for bountee chees to wone
Thow humble and heigh  ouer euery creature
Thow nobledest so ferforth oure nature
That no desdaign  the makere hadde of kynde

 With Inne the Cloistre blisful  of thy sydis
Took mannes shape  the eternal loue and pees
That of the tryne compas  lord and gyde is

Ay heryen  and thow virgyne wemmeles
Bar of thy body  and dweltest mayde pure
The creatour  of euery creature
  
Assembled is in thee Magnificence
With mercy  goodnesse  and swich pitee
That thow that art the sonne of excellence
Nat oonly  helpest hem þat prayen thee
But ofte tyme  of thy benygnytee

Thow goost biforn  and art hir lyues leche
Now help thow meke  and blisful faire mayde

And thogh that I  vnworthy sone of Eue

 And for that feith is deed  with outen werkis
So for to werken  yif me wit and space

Be myn Aduocate  in that heighe place
Ther as with outen ende  is songe Osanne
Thow cristes moder  doghter deere of Anne

That troubled is  by the contagion
Of my body  and also by the wighte
Of erthely lust and fals affeccion
O hauene  o refut o sauacion
Of hem  that been in sorwe and in distresse
Now help  for to my werk I wol me dresse
  
 Yet praye ich yow  þat reden that I write
fforyeue me  that I do no diligence
This ilke storie  subtilly tendite
ffor bothe haue I  the wordes and sentence
Of hym  that at the Seintes reuerence
The storie wroot and folwen hir legende
And pray yow  that ye wol my werk amende
First wolde I yow  the name of Seinte Cecilie
Expowne  as men may in hir storie se
It is to seyn on englissh  heuenes lilie
ffor pure chastnesse  of virginitee
Or for she whitnesse hadde of honestee
And grene of conscience  and of good fame
The swote sauour lilie  was hir name
 Or Cecile is to seyn  the wey to blynde
ffor she ensample was  by good techynge
Or ellis Cecile  as I writen fynde
Is ioyned  by a manere conioignynge
Of heuene  and lia  and here in figurynge
The heuene is set for thoght of holynesse
And lia  for hir lastynge bisynesse
 Cecile may eek be seyd in this manere
Wantynge of blyndnesse  for hir grete light
Of Sapience  and for hir thewes clere
Or ellis lo  this maydenes name bright
Of heuene and leos comth  for which by right
Men myghte hire wel  the heuene of peple calle
Ensample of goode  and wise werkes alle
  
 For leos  peple in englissh is to seye  
And right as men may  in the heuene see
The sonne and moone  and sterres euery weye
Right so men goostly  in this mayden free
Sayen  of feith  the magnanymytee
And eek the cleernesse hool of Sapience
And sondry werkes  brighte of excellence
 And right so  as thise Philosophres write
That heuene is swift and round  and eek brennynge
Right so  was faire Cecile the white
fful swift and bisy  euere in good werkynge
And round and hool  in good perseuerynge
And brennyng euere in charite  ful brighte
Now haue I yow declared  what she highte
This mayde bright Cecilie  as hir lyf seith
Was come of Romayns  and of noble kynde
And from hir Cradel  vp fostred in the feith
Of crist and baar his gospel in hir mynde
She neuere cessed  as I writen fynde
Of hir prayere  and god to loue and drede
Bisekyng hym  to kepe hir maydenhede
 And whan this mayden sholde  vn til a man
Ywedded be  that was ful yong of age
Which that ycleped was Valerian
And day was comen  of hir mariage
She ful deuout and humble in hir corage
Vnder hir robe of gold  that sat ful faire
Hadde next hir flessh  yclad hire in an haire
  
 And whil that the Organs  maden melodie
To god allone  in hir herte  thus soong she
O·lord my soule  and eek my body gye
Vnwemmed  lest that I confounded be
And for his loue  that deyde vp on the tree
Euery seconde  and thridde day she faste
Ay biddyng in hir orisons ful faste
e nyght cam  and to bedde moste she gon
With hire housbonde  as ofte is the manere
And priuely  to hym she seyde anon
O swete  and wel biloued spouse deere
Ther is a conseil  and ye wolde it heere
Which that right fayn  I wolde vn to yow seye
So that ye swere  ye shul it nat biwreye
 Valerian gan faste  vn to hir swere
That for no cas  ne thyng þat myghte be
He sholde neuere mo biwreyen here
And thanne at erst to hym seyde she
I haue an Aungel  which that loueth me
That with gret loue  wher so I wake or slepe
Is redy ay  my body for to kepe
 And if that he  may feelen out of drede
That ye me touche  or loue in vileynye
He right anon  wol sleen yow with the dede
And in youre youthe  thus ye shullen dye
And if that ye  in clene loue me gye
He wol yow loue as me  for youre clennesse
And shewe to yow  his ioye and his brightnesse
  
 This Valerian  corrected as god wolde
Answerde agayn  if I shal trusten thee
Lat me that Aungel seen  and hym biholde
And if that it a verray Aungel be
Thanne wol I doon  as thow hast prayed me
And if thow loue another man  for sothe
Right with this swerd  than wol I sle yow bothe
 Cecile answerde  right in this wise
If that yow list the Aungel shal ye se
So that ye trowe on crist and yow baptise
Goth forth to Via Apia quod she
That fro this town  ne stant but Milys thre
And to the poure folkes  that ther dwellen
Sey hem right thus  as that I shal yow tellen
 Telle hem  that I Cecile  yow to hem sente  
To shewen yow  the goode Vrban the olde
ffor secree nedes  and for good entente
And whan that ye  Seint Vrban han biholde
Telle hym the wordes  whiche I to yow tolde
And whan that he  hath purged you fro synne
Thanne shal ye seen that Aungel  er we twynne
 This Valerian  is to the place gon
And right as hym was taught by his lernynge
He foond  this holy olde Vrban anon
Among the Seintes buryels lotynge
And he anon  with outen tariynge
Dide his message  and whan that he it tolde
Vrban for ioye  hise handes gan vp holde
  
 The teerys from hise eyen  leet he falle
Almyghty lord  o Ihesu crist quod he
Sowere of chaast conseil  hierde of vs alle
The fruyt of thilke seed  of chastitee
That thow hast sowe in Cecilie  taak to thee
Lo lyk a bisy bee  with outen gyle
Thee serueth ay  thyn owne thral Cecile
 ffor thilke spouse  that she took but now
fful lyk a fiers leon  she sendeth heere
As meke  as euere was any lamb to yow
And with that word  anon ther gan appeere
An old man  clad in white clothes cleere
That hadde a book with lettre of gold in honde
And gan  biforn Valerian to stonde
 Valerian as deed  fil doun for drede
Whan he hym say  and he vp hente hym tho
And on his book right thus he gan to rede
O lord  o feith  o god with oute mo
O cristendom  and fader of alle also
Abouen alle  and oueral euery where
Thise wordes  al with gold ywriten were
han this was rad  thanne seyde this olde man
Leuestow this thyng or no  sey ye  or nay
I leue al this thyng quod Valerian
ffor sother thyng than this  I dar wel say
Vnder the heuene  no wight thynke may
Tho vanysshed this olde man  he nyste where
And pope Vrban  hym cristned right there
  
 Valerian goth hom  and fynt Cecilie
In with his chambre  with an Aungel stonde
This Aungel hadde  of Roses and of lilie
Corones two  the whiche he bar in honde
And first to Cecile  as I vnderstonde
He yaf that oon  and after gan he take
That oother  to Valerian hir make
 With body clene  and with vnwemmed thoght
Kepeth ay wel  thise corones quod he
ffro Paradys  to yow  haue I hem broght
Ne neuere mo  ne shal they roten be
Ne lese hir swote sauour  trusteth me
Ne neuere wight shal seen hem with his eye
But he be chaast  and hate vileynye
 And thow Valerian  for thow so soone
Assentedest to good conseil also
Sey what thee list and thow shalt han thy boone
I haue a brother  quod Valerian tho
That in this world  I loue no man so
I pray yow  that my brother may han grace
To knowe the trouthe  as I do in this place
 The Aungel seyde  god liketh thy requeste
And bothe  with the palm of martirdom
Ye shullen come  vn to his blisful feste
And with that word  Tiburce his brother coom
And whan that he  the sauour vndernoom
Which þat the Roses  and the lilies caste
With Inne his herte  he gan to wondre faste
  
 And seyde  I wondre this tyme of the yere  
Whennes  that swote sauour  cometh so
Of Rose and lilies  that I smelle heere
ffor thogh I hadde hem  in myne handes two
The sauour myghte in me  no depper go
The swete smel  that in myn herte I fynde
Hath chaunged me  al in another kynde
 Valerian seyde  two corones han we
Snow white and Rose reed  þat shynen clere
Which þat thyne eyen  han no myght to se
And as thow smellest hem  thurgh my prayere
So shaltow seen hem  leue brother deere
If it so be  thow wolt with outen slouthe
Bileue aright and knowen verray trouthe
 Tiburce answerde  seystow this to me
In soothnesse  or in dreem I herkne this
In dremes quod Valerian  han we be
Vn to this tyme  brother myn ywys
But now at erst in trouthe oure dwellyng is
How wostow this quod Tiburce  in what wyse
Quod Valerian  that shal I thee deuyse
 The Aungel of god  hath me the trouthe ytaught
Which thow shalt seen  if that thow wolt reneye
The ydoles  and be clene  and ellis naught
And of the myracle  of thise corones tweye
Seint Ambrose  in his preface  list to seye
Solempnely  this noble doctour deere
Commendeth it and seith in this manere
  
 The palme of martirdom  for to receyue
Seinte Cecile  fulfild of goddes yifte
The world  and eek hir chambre gan she weyue
Witnesse Tiburces  and Cecilies shrifte
To whiche  god of his bountee wolde shifte
Corones two  of floures wel smellynge
And made his Aungel  hem the corones brynge
e mayde hath broght men  to blisse aboue
The world hath wist what it is worth certeyn
Deuocion  of chastitee to loue
Tho shewed hym Cecile  al open and pleyn
That alle ydoles  nys but a thyng in veyn
ffor they been dowmbe  and ther to they been deue
And charged hym  hise ydoles for to leue
 Who so þat troweth nat this  a beest he is
Quod tho Tiburce  if that I shal nat lye
And she gan kisse his brest that herde this
And was ful glad  he koude trouthe espye
This day I take thee  for myn allye
Seyde this blisful  faire mayde deere
And after that she seyde as ye may heere
 Lo right so  as the loue of Crist quod she
Made me thy brotheres wyf  right in that wise
Anon for myn allie  heere take I thee
Syn that thow wolt thyne ydoles despise
Go with thy brother now  and thee baptise
And make thee clene  so þat thow mowe biholde
The Aungeles face  of which thy brother tolde
  
 Tiburce answerde  and seyde brother deere
ffirst tel me whider that I shal  and to what man
To whom quod he  com forth with right good cheere
I wol thee lede  vn to the pope Vrban
Til Vrban  brother myn Valerian
Quod tho Tiburce  woltow me thider lede
Me thynketh  that it were a wonder dede
 Ne menestow nat Vrban  quod he tho
That is so ofte  dampned to be deed
And woneth in halkes  alwey to and fro
And dar nat ones  putte forth his heed
Men sholde hym brennen  in a fyr so reed
If he were founde  or þat men myghte hym spye
And we also  to bere hym compaignye
 And whil we seken  thilke diuinytee  
That is yhyd  in heuene priuely
Algate  ybrend in this world shul we be
To whom Cecile  answerde boldely
Men myghten dreden  wel and skilfully
This lyf to lese  myn owene deere brother
If thys were lyuyng oonly  and noon oother
 But ther is bettre lyf  in oother place
That neuere shal be lost ne drede thee noght
Which goddes sone  vs tolde thurgh his grace
That fadres sone  hath alle thynges wroght
And al that wroght is  with a skilful thoght
The goost that fro the fader  gan procede
Hath souled hem  with outen any drede
  
 By word and by myracle  he goddes sone
Whan he was  in this world  declared heere
That ther was oother lyf  ther men may wone
To whom answerde Tiburce  o suster deere
Ne seydestow right now  in this manere
Ther nys but o god  lord in sothfastnesse
And now of thre  how maystow bere witnesse
 That shal I telle quod she  er I go
Right as a man  hath sapiences thre
Memorie  engyn  and intellect also
So in o beynge  of diuinytee
Thre persones  may ther right wel be
Tho gan she hym  ful bisily to preche
Of cristes come  and of his peynes teche
 And manye pointes  of his passion
How goddes sone  in this world was withholde
To doon mankynde  pleyn remission
That was ybounde  in synne  and cares colde
Al this thyng she vn to Tiburce tolde
And after this  Tiburce in good entente
With Valerian  to pope Vrban he wente
at thanked god  and with glad herte and light
He cristned hym  and made hym in that place
Parfit in his lernyng goddes knyght
And after this  Tiburce gat swich grace
That euery day  he say in tyme and space
The Aungel of god  and euery maner boone
That he god axed  it was sped ful soone
  
 It were ful hard  by ordre for to seyn
How many wondres  Ihesus for hem wroghte
But at the laste  to tellen short and pleyn
The sergeantz  of the town of Rome hem soghte
And hem biforn Almache  the Prefect broghte
Which hem opposed  and knew al hir entente
And to the ymage of Iubiter  hem sente
 And seyde  who so wol nat sacrifise
Swape of his heed  this is my sentence heer
Anon thise martirs  that I yow deuyse
Oon Maximus  that was an Officer
Of the Prefectes  and his Corniculer
Hem hente  and whan he forth the Seintes ladde
Hym self he weep  for pitee that he hadde
 Whan Maximus  hadde herd the Seintes loore
He gat hym  of the tormentours leue
And ladde hem to his hous  with oute moore
And with hir prechyng er that it were eue
They gonnen  fro the tormentours to reue
And fro Maxime  and fro his folk echone
The false feith  to trowe in god allone
 Cecile cam  whan it was woxen nyght
With preestes  that hem cristned alle yfeere
And afterward  whan day was woxen light
Cecile hym seyde  with a ful stedefast cheere
Now cristes owene knygntes  leue and deere
Cast al awey  the werkes of derknesse
And armeth yow  in armure of brightnesse
  
 Ye han for sothe  ydoon a greet bataille  
Youre cours is doon  youre feith han ye conserued
Goth to the corone of lyf that may nat faille
The rightful Iuge  which that ye han serued
Shal yeue it yow  as ye han it disserued
And whan this thyng was seyd  as I deuyse
Men ledde hem forth  to doon the sacrifise
 But whan they weren  to the place broght
To tellen shortly  the conclusioun
They nolde encense  ne sacrifice right noght
But on hir knees  they setten hem adoun
With humble herte  and sad deuocioun
And losten  bothe hir heuedes  in the place
Hir soules wenten  to the kyng of grace
 This Maximus  that say this thyng bityde
With pitous teerys  tolde it anon right
That he hir soules  saugh to heuene glyde
With Aungeles  ful of cleernesse  and of light
And with his word  conuerted many a wight
ffor which Almachius  dide hym so bete
With whippe of leed  til he his lyf gan lete
 Cecile hym took  and buryed hym anon
By Tiburce and Valerian softely
With Inne hir buryyng place  vnder the stoon
And after this  Almachius hastily
Bad hise Ministres  fecchen openly
Cecilie  so þat she myghte in his presence
Doon sacrifice  and Iubiter encense
  
 But they conuerted  at hir wise loore
Wepten ful sore  and yauen ful credence
Vn to hir word  and cryden moore and moore
Crist goddes sone  with outen difference
Is verray god  this is al oure sentence
That hath so good a seruant  hym to serue
This with o voys  we trowen  thogh we sterue
achius  that herde of this doynge
Bad fecchen Cecilie  that he myghte hir se
And alderfirst lo  this was his axynge
What maner womman  artow quod he
I am a gentil womman born  quod she
I axe thee quod he  thogh it the greue
Of thy religion  and of thy bileue
 Ye han bigonne  youre question folily
Quod she  that wolden two answeres conclude
In o demande  ye axed lewedly
Almachie answerde  vn to that similitude
Of whennes comth  thyn answeryng so rude
Of whennes quod she  whan that she was freyned
Of conscience  and of good feith vnfeyned
 Almachius seyde  ne takestow noon hede
Of my power  and she answerde hym  this
Youre myght quod she  ful litel is to drede
ffor euery  mortal mannes power nys
But lyk a bladdre  ful of wynd ywis

May al the boost of it be leyd ful lowe
  
 fful wrongfully  bigonne thow quod he
And yet in wrong is al thy perseuerance
Wostow nat how  oure myghty princes free
Han thus comanded  and maad ordinance
That euery cristen wight shal han penance
But if that he  his cristendom withseye
And goon al quyt if he wol it reneye
 Youre Prynces erren  as youre nobleye dooth
Quod tho Cecile  and with a wood sentence
Ye make vs gilty  and is nat sooth
ffor ye þat knowen wel  oure Innocence
ffor as muche  as we doon a reuerence
To crist and for we bere a cristen name
Ye putte on vs  a cryme  and eek a blame·
 But we that knowen  thilke name so  
ffor vertuous  we may it nat withseye
Almache answerde  chees oon of thise two
Do sacrifice  or cristendom reneye
That thow mowe now  escapen by that weye
At which  this holy  blisful faire mayde
Gan for to laughe  and to the Iuge she sayde
 O Iuge confus  in thy nycetee
Wiltow  that I reneye Innocence
To maken me  a wikked wight quod she
Lo  he dissimuleth heere in audience
He stareth and woodeth  in his aduertence
To whom Almachius  vnsely wrecche
Ne wostow nat how fer my myght may strecche
  
 Han noght oure myghty princes  to me yeuen
Ye bothe power  and auctoritee
To maken folk  to dyen or to lyuen
Why spekestow so prowdly  thanne to me
I speke noght but stedefastly quod she
Nat proudly  for I seye  as for my syde
We haten dedly  thilke vice of pryde
 And if thow drede nat a sooth to here
Thanne wol I shewe  al openly by right
That thow hast maad  a ful greet lesyng here
Thow seist thy princes  han thee yeuen myght
Bothe for to sleen  and for to quyken a wight
Thow that ne mayst but oonly lyf byreue
Thow hast noon oother power  ne no leue
 But thow mayst seyn  thy princes han thee maked
Ministre of deeth  for if thow speke of me
Thow lyest for thy power is ful naked
Do wey thy boldnesse  seyde Almachius tho
And sacrifice  to oure goddes  er thow go
I recche nat what wrong that thow me profre
ffor I kan suffre it as a Philosophre
 thilke wronges  may I nat endure
hat thow spekest of oure goddes here quod he
Cecilie answerde  o nyce creature
Thow seydest no word  syn thow spak to me
That I ne knew therwith thy nycetee
And that thow were  in euery maner wise
A lewed Officer  a veyn Iustise
  
 Ther lakketh no thyng to thyne outter eyen
That thow nart blynd  for thyng þat we seen alle
That is a stoon  that men may wel espien
That ilke stoon  a god thow wolt it calle
I rede thee  lat thyn hand vp on it falle
And taste it wel  and stoon thow shalt it fynde
Syn that thow seest nat  with thyne eyen blynde
 It is a shame  that the peple shal
So scornen thee  and laughe at thy folye
ffor comenly  men woot it wel ouer al
That myghty god  is in hise heuenes hye
And thise ymages  wel thow mayst espye
To thee  ne to hem self  mowe noght profite
ffor in effect they be nat worth a myte
 Thise  and swiche othere  seyde she
And he weex wrooth  and bad men sholde hir lede
Hoom til hir hous  and in hir hous quod he
Bren hire  right in a Bath of flambes rede
And as he bad  right so was doon the dede
ffor in a Bath  they gonne hire faste shetten
And nyght and day  greet fyr they vnder betten
 The longe nyght and eek a day also
ffor al the fyr  and eek the Bathes hete
She sat al coold  and feeled no wo
It made hir nat o drope for to swete
But in that Bath  hir lyf she moste lete
ffor he Almachius  with a ful wikke entente
To sleen hire in the Bath  his sonde sente
  
 Thre strokes in the nekke  he smoot hire tho  
The tormentour  but for no maner chaunce
He myghte noght smyte al hir nekke atwo
And for ther was  that tyme an ordinaunce
That no man  sholde doon man swich penaunce
The ferthe strook to smyten  softe or soore
This tormentour  ne dorste do namoore
 But half deed  with hir nekke ycoruen there
He lefte hir lye  and on his wey he went
The cristen folk whiche þat aboute hire were
With shetes  han the blood ful faire yhent
Thre dayes  lyued she in this torment
And neuere cessed  hem the feith to teche
That she hadde fostred  hem she gan to preche
 And hem she yaf  hir moebles  and hir thyng
And to the Pope Vrban  bitook hem tho
And seyde  I axed þis of heuene kyng
To han respit thre dayes  and namo
To recommende to yow  er that I go
Thise soules  lo  and þat I myghte do werche

Among hise othere Seintes honestly

In which  in to this day  in noble wyse

SIre clerk of Oxenford  oure hoost sayde
Ye ride as coy  and stille as dooth a mayde
Were newe spoused  sittyng at the bord
This day ne herde I  of youre tonge a word
I trowe ye studie  aboute som Sophyme
But Salomon seith  euery thyng hath tyme
 ffor goddes sake  as beth of bettre cheere
It is no tyme  for to studien heere
Tel vs som murie tale  by youre fey

But precheth nat as freres doon in lente
To maken vs  for oure olde synnes wepe

Speketh so pleyn at this tyme  we yow preye
That we may vnderstonde  what ye seye
 This worthy clerk benygnely answerde
Hoost quod he  I am vnder youre yerde
Ye han of vs  as now the gouernance
And therfore  wol I do yow obeisance
  
As fer  as reson asketh hardily
I wol yow telle a tale  which that I
Lerned at Padwe  of a worthy Clerk
As proued  by his wordes and his werk
He is now deed  and nayled in his Cheste
I pray to god  so yeue his soule reste
 ffraunceys Petrak the lauryat poete
Highte this clerk whos Rethoryk swete
Enlumyned al Ytaille  of Poetrie
As Lynyan dide  of Philosophie
Or lawe  or oother art particuler
But deth  þat wol nat suffre vs dwellen her
But as it were  a twynklyng of an eye  
Hem bothe hath slayn  and alle shul we dye
 But forth to tellen  of this worthy man
That taughte me this tale  as I bigan
I seye þat first with heigh stile he enditeth
Er he  the body of his tale writeth
A prohemie  in which discryueth he
Pemond  and of Saluces the contree
And speketh of Appenyn  the hilles hye
That been the boundes  of west lumbardye
And of Mouut Vesulus  in special
Wher as the Poo  out of a welle smal
Taketh his firste spryngyng  and his cours
That Estward  ay encresseth in his cours
To Emeleward  to fferare  and Venyse
The which  a long thyng were to deuyse
And trewely  as to my Iuggement
Me thynketh it a thyng inpertinent
Saue þat he wole  convoien his matere
But this his tale  which þat ye shal heere

Ther is  at the west syde of Ytaille
Doun at the roote  of Vesulus the colde
A lusty playne  habundant of vitaille
Wher many a tour and town  thow mayst biholde
That founded were  in tyme of fadres olde
And many another  delitable sighte
And Saluces  this noble contree highte
 A Markys whilom  lord was of that lond
As were his worthy eldres hym bifore
And obeysant ay redy to his hond
Were alle his liges  bothe lasse and moore
Thus in delit he lyueth  and hath doon yoore
Biloued and drad  thurgh fauour of ffortune
Bothe of his lordes  and of his commune
er with he was  to speke as of lynage
The gentileste  yborn of Lumbardye
A fair persone  and strong and yong of age
And ful of honour  and of curteisye
Discret ynogh  his contree for to gye
Saue in some thynges  þat he was to blame
And Walter  was this yonge lordes name
 I blame hym thus  that he considered noght
In tyme comynge  what myghte hym bityde
But on his lust present was al his thoght
As for to hauke  and hunte on euery syde
Wel neigh  alle oothere cures leet he slyde
And eek he nolde  and that was worst of alle
Wedde no wyf for noght þat may bifalle
  
 Oonly that point his peple bar so soore
That flokmele on a day  they to hym wente
And oon of hem  þat wisest was of loore
Or ellis  þat the lord  best wolde assente
That he sholde telle hym  what his peple mente
Or ellis koude he  shewe wel swich matere
He to the Markys seyde  as ye shal heere
 O noble Markys  youre humanitee
Assureth vs  and yeueth vs hardynesse
As ofte  as tyme is of necessitee
That we to yow  mowe telle oure heuynesse
Accepteth lord  now of youre gentillesse
That we with pitous herte  vn to yow pleyne
And lat youre erys  noght my voys disdeyne
 Al haue I noght to doone  in this matere
Moore than another man  hath in this place
Yet for as muche  as ye my lord so deere
Han alwey shewed me  fauour and grace
I dar the bettre  aske of yow a space
Of audience  to shewen oure requeste
And ye my lord  to doon right as yow leste
 ffor certes lord so wel vs liketh yow  
And al youre werk and euere han doon  þat we
Ne kouden nat vs self  deuysen how
We myghte lyuen  in moore felicitee
Saue o thyng lord  if it youre wille be
That for to been a wedded man  yow leste
Thanne were youre peple  in souereyn hertes reste
 Boweth youre nekke  vnder that blisful yok
Of souereyntee  noght of seruyse
Which that men clepe  spousaille  or wedlok
And thenketh lord  among youre thoghtes wise
  
How þat oure dayes passe  in sondry wyse
ffor thogh we slepe  or wake  or renne  or ryde
Ay fleeth the tyme  it nel no man abyde
 And thogh youre grene youthe  floure as yit
In crepeth age alwey  as stille as stoon
And deth  manaceth euery age and smyt
In ech estat for ther escapeth noon
And also certeyn  as we knowe echon
That we shal dye  as vncerteyn we alle
Been of that day  whan deth shal on vs falle
 Accepteth thanne of vs  the trewe entente
That neuere yet refuseden thyn heste
And we wol lord  if þat ye wol assente
Chese yow a wyf in short tyme at the leeste
Born of the gentileste  and of the meeste
Of al this lond  so þat it oghte seme
Honour  to god and yow  as we kan deme
 Delyuere vs  out of al this bisy drede
And tak a wyf  for heighe goddes sake
ffor if so bifelle  as god forbede
That thurgh youre deeth  youre ligne sholde slake
And that a straunge Successour  sholde take
Youre heritage  o wo were vs alyue
Wher fore  we pray yow  hastily to wyue

Made the Markys herte  han pitee
Ye wol quod he  myn owene peple deere
To that I neuere erst thoghte  streyne me
I me reioysed  of my libertee
That selde tyme  is founde in mariage
Ther I was free  I moot ben in seruage
  
 But nathelees  I se youre trewe entente
And truste vp on youre wit and haue doon ay
Wher fore  of my free wyl  I wol assente
To wedde me  as soone as euere I may
But ther as ye  han profred me to day
To chese me a wyf I yow relesse
That choys  and pray yow of that profre cesse
 ffor god it woot þat children ofte ben
Vnlyk hir worthy eldres hem bifore
Bountee comth al of god  nat of the stren
Of which  they been engendred and ybore
I triste in goddes bountee  and ther fore
My mariage  and myn estat and reste
I hym bitake  he may doon as hym leste
 Lat me allone  in chesyng of my wyf
That charge vp on my bak I wol endure
But I pray yow  and charge vp on youre lyf
That what wyf þat I take  ye me assure
To worshipe hire  whil þat hir lyf may dure
In word and werk bothe here and euerywhere
As she  an Emperours doghter were
 And ferther moore  this shal ye swere  þat ye
Agayn my choys  shal neither grucche ne stryue
ffor sith  I shal forgoon my libertee
At your requeste  as euere mote I thryue
Ther as myn herte is set ther wol I wyue
And but ye wol assente  in swich manere
I pray yow  speketh namoore of this matere
 With hertly wyl  they sworen and assenten  
To al this thyng ther seyde no wight nay
Bisekynge hym of grace  ēr þat they wenten
That he wolde  graunten hem a certein day
  
Of his spousaille  as soone as euere I may
ffor yet alwey  the peple som what dredde
Lest that the Markys  no wyf wolde wedde
 He graunted hem a day  swich as hym leste
On which  he wolde be wedded sikerly
And seyde  he dide al this at hir requeste
And they  with humble entente buxomly
Knelynge vp on hir knees  ful reuerently
Hym thanken alle  and thus they han an ende
Of hir entente  and hom agayn they wende
And her vp on  he to his officers
Comaundeth  for the feste to purueye
And to his pryuee knyghtes and Squyers
Swich charge yaf  as hym liste on hem leye
And they  to his comandement obeye
And ech of hem  dooth al his diligence
To doon  vnto the feste reuerence
NOght fer  fro thilke paleys honurable
Wher as this Markys  shoope his mariage
Ther stood a Throope  of site delitable
In which þat poure folk  of that village
Hadden hir bestes  and hir herbergage
And of hir labour  token hir sustenance
After that the erthe  yaf hem habundance
mong this poure folk  ther dwelte a man
Which þat was holden  pourest of hem alle
But heighe god  som tyme senden kan
His grace  in to a litel Oxes Stalle
Ianicula  men of that Throope hym calle
A doghter hadde he  fair ynogh to sighte
And Grisildis  this yonge mayden highte
  
 But for to speke  of vertuous beautee
Thanne was she  oon the faireste vnder the sonne
ffor poureliche  yfostred vp was she
No likerous lust was thurgh hir herte yronne
Wel ofter of the welle  than of the tonne
She drank and for she wolde vertu plese
She knew wel labour  but noon ydel ese
 But thogh this mayde  tendre were of age
Yet in the brest of hir virginitee
Ther was enclosed  rype and sad corage
And in gret reuerence  and charitee
Hir olde poure fader  fostred she
A fewe sheepe  spynnynge  on feld she kepte
She wolde noght been ydel  til she slepte
 And whan she homward cam  she wolde brynge
Wortes  or othere herbes  tymes ofte
The whiche she shredde  and seeth for his lyuynge
And made hir bed ful harde  and no thyng softe
And ay she kepte  hir fadres lyf on lofte
With euery obeysance  and diligence
That child may doon  to fadres reuerence
 Vp on Grisilde  this poure creature
fful ofte sithe  this Markys sette his eye
And he  on huntyng rood per auenture
And whan it fil  þat he myghte hire espie
He noght wit wantowne lookyng of folye
Hise eyen caste on hire  but in sad wyse
Vp on hir cheere  he wolde hym ofte auyse
 Commendynge in his herte  hir wommanhede  
And eek hir vertu  passyng any wight
Of so yong age  as wel in cheere as dede
ffor thogh the peple  hath no greet insight
  
In vertue  he considered ful right
Hir bountee  and disposed þat he wolde
Wedde hire oonly  if euere he wedden sholde
 The day of weddyng cam  but no wight kan
Telle what womman  þat it sholde be
ffor which merueille  wondred many a man
And seyden  whan they were in priuetee
Wol nat oure lord  yet leue his vanytee
Wol he nat wedde  allas the while
Why wol he thus  hym self and vs bigyle
 But nathelees  this Markys hath doon make
Of gemmes  set in gold and in Asure
Broches and rynges  for Grisildis sake
And of hir clothyng took he the mesure
Of a mayde  lyk to hir stature
And eek of othere  aournementes alle
That vnto swich a weddyng sholde falle
 The tyme of vndren  of the same day
Approcheth  þat this weddyng sholde be
And al the palays  put was in array
Bothe halle and chambres  ech in his degree
Houses of office  stuffed with plentee
Ther maystow seen  of deynteuous vitaille
That may be founde  as fer as last Ytaille
 This Roial Markys  richeliche arrayed
Lordes and ladys  in his compaignye
The whiche  þat to the feste were yprayed
And of his retenue  the Bachilrye
With many a sown  of sondry melodye
Vn to the village  of the which I tolde
In this array  the righte wey han holde
  
silde of this  god woot ful Innocent
hat for hire shapen was  al this array
To fecchen water  at a welle  is went
And cometh hom  as soone as euer she may
ffor wel she hadde herd seyd  þat thilke day
The Markys sholde wedde  and if she myghte
She wolde fayn han seyn  som of that sighte
 She thoghte  I wole with othere maydens stonde
That been my felawes  in oure dore and se
The Markisesse  and therfore wol I fonde
To doon at hom  as soone as it may be
The labour  which þat longeth vn to me
And thanne I may  at leyser hir biholde
Yf she this wey  vn to the Castel holde
 And as she wolde  ouer the thresshfold gon
The Markys cam  and gan hire for to calle
And she sette doun  hir water pot anon
Bisyde the thresshfold  in an Oxes Stalle
And doun vp on hir knees  she gan to falle
And with sad contenance  kneleth stille
Til she hadde herd  what was the lordes wille
 This thoghtful Markys  spak vn to this mayde
fful sobrely  and seyde in this manere
Where is youre fader  o Grisildis he sayde
And she with reuerence  in humble cheere
Answerde  lord he is al redy heere
And she goth  with outen lenger lette
And to the Markys  she hir fader fette
 He by the hand  than took this olde man
And seyde thus  whan he hym hadde asyde
Ianicula  I neither may ne kan
Lenger  the plesance of myn herte hyde
  
If that thow vouche sauf  what so bityde
Thy doghter wol I take  er that I wende
As for my wyf vn to my lyues ende
 Thow louest me  I woot it wel certeyn  
And art my feithful lige man ybore
And al that liketh me  I dar wel seyn
It liketh thee  and specially ther fore
Tel me that point that I haue seyd bifore
If that thow wolt vn to that purpos drawe
To take me  as for thy sone in lawe
 The sodeyn cas  this man astoneyd so
That reed he weex abayst and al quakyng
He stood  vnnethe seyde he wordes mo
But oonly this  lord quod he  my willyng
Is as ye wole  ne ayeins youre likyng
I wol no thyng ye be my lord so deere
Right as yow list gouerneth this matere
 Yet wol I  quod this Markys  softely
That in thy chambre  I and thow and she
Haue a collacion  and wostow why
ffor I wol aske  if it hir wille be
To be my wyf  and rule hire after me
And al this shal be doon  in thy presence
I wol noght speke  out of thyn audience
 And in the chambre  whil they were aboute
Hir tretys  which as ye shal after heere
The peple cam  vn to the hous with oute
And wondred hem  in how honeste manere
And tentifly  she kepte hir fader deere
But outrely  Grisildis wondre myghte
ffor neuere eft ne saw she swich a sighte
  
 No wonder is  thogh þat she were astoned
To seen so greet a gest come in to place
She neuere was  to swiche gestes woned
ffor which she looked  with ful pale face
But shortly  forth this matere for to chace
Thise arn the wordes  þat this Markys sayde
To this benygne  verray feithful mayde
silde he seyde  ye shal wel vnderstonde
It liketh to youre fader  and to me
That I yow wedde  and eek it may so stonde
As I suppose  ye wol þat it so be
But thise demandes  aske I first quod he
That sith it shal be doon  in hastif wyse
Wol ye assente  or ellis yow auyse
 I sey this  be ye redy  with good herte
To al my lust and þat I frely may
As me best thynketh  do yow laughe or smerte
And neuere ye to grucche it nyght ne day
And eek whan I sey ye  ne sey nat nay
Neither by word  ne frownyng contenance
Swere this  and heere I swere oure alliance
 Wondrynge vp on this word  quakyng for drede
She seyde lord  vndigne  or vnworthy
I am  to thilke honour  þat ye me bede
But as ye wol your self right so wol I
And heere I swere  that neuere willyngly
In werk ne thoght I nel yow disobeye
ffor to be deed  thogh me were looth to deye
 This is ynough  Grisilde myn quod he
And forth he goth  with a ful sobre cheere
Out at the dore  and after that cam she
And to the peple  he seyde in this manere
  
This is my wyf quod he  that standeth heere
Honureth hire  and loueth hire I preye
Who so me loueth  there is namoore to seye
 And for þat no thyng of hir olde gere
She sholde brynge in to his hous  he bad
That wommen  sholde dispoylen hir right there
Of which  thise ladys  were noght right glad
To handle hir clothes  wher Inne she was clad
But nathelees  this mayde bright of hewe
ffro foot to heed  they clothed han al newe
 Hir herys han they kembd  that laye vntressed  
fful rudely  and with hir fyngres smale
A coroune on hir heed  they han ydressed
And sette hire ful Nowches grete and smale
Of hir array  what sholde I make a tale
Vnnethe the peple hir knew  for hir fairnesse
Whan she translated was  in swich richesse
 This Markys  hath hire spoused with a ryng
Broght for the same cause  and thanne hir sette
Vp on an hors snow whyt and wel amblyng
And to his palays  er he lenger lette
With ioyful peple  þat hir ledde and mette
Convoied hire  and thus  the day they spende
In reuel  til the sonne gan descende
 And shortly  forth this tale for to chace
I seye  þat to this newe Markysesse
God hath  swich fauour sent hire of his grace
That it ne semed nat by liklynesse
That she  was born and fed in rudenesse
As in a cote  or in an Oxes Stalle
But norissed  in an Emperours halle
  
 To euery wight she woxen is so deere
And worshipful  þat folk ther she was bore
That from hir burthe  knewe hire yeer by yeere
Vnnethe trowed they  but dorste han swore
That to Ianicle  of which I spak bifore
She doghter were  for as by coniecture
Hem thoughte  she was another creature
 ffor thogh þat euere  vertuous was she
She was encressed  in swich excellence
Of thewes goode  yset in heigh bountee
And so discreet and fair of eloquence
So benygne  and so digne of reuerence
And koude so  the peples herte embrace
That ech hir louede  that looked on hir face
oght oonly  of Saluce in the town
Publissed was  the bountee of hir name
But eek bisyde  in many a Regioun
If oon seyde wel  another seyde the same
So spradde  of hir heighe bountee the fame
That men and wommen  as wel yonge as olde
Goon to Saluce  on hire to biholde
 Thus Walter lowely  nay but roially
Wedded  with fortunat honestetee
In goddes pees  lyueth ful esily
At hom  and outward grace ynow hath he
And for he saugh  þat vnder lowe degree
Was ofte vertu hyd  the peple hym helde
A prudent man  and that is seyn ful selde
 Noght oonly  this Grisildis  thurgh hir wit
Koude al the feet of wifly humblenesse
But eek whan þat the cas required it
The commune profit koude she redresse
  
Ther nas discord  rancour  ne heuynesse
In al that land  þat she ne koude apese
And wisly  brynge hem alle in reste and ese
 Thogh þat hir housbond absent were  anon
If gentil men  or othere of hir contree
Were wrothe  she wolde bryngen hem aton
So wise  and rype wordes hadde she
And Iuggementz  of so greet equytee
That she from heuene sent was  as men wende
Peple to saue  and euery wrong tamende
 Nat longe tyme after that this Grisild
Was ywedded  she a doghter hath ybore
Al hadde hir leuere  haue had a knaue child
Glad was the Markys  and the folk ther fore
ffor thogh a mayde child  coome al bifore
She may  vn to a knaue child atteyne
By liklyhede  syn she nys nat bareyne
THer fil  as it bifalleth tymes mo
Whan þat this child  hath souked but a throwe
This Markys  in his herte longeth so
To tempte his wyf hir sadnesse for to knowe
That he ne myghte  out of his herte throwe
This merueilous desir  his wyf tassaye
Nedelees god woot he thoghte hire for tafraye
 He hadde assayed hire  ynow bifore
And fond hir euere good  what neded it
Hir for to tempte  and alwey moore and moore
Thogh som men preyse it for a subtil wit
But as for me  I seye þat yuele it sit
Tassaye a wyf  whan þat it is no nede
And putten hire  in angwyssh and in drede
  
ffor which  this Markys  wroghte in this manere
He cam allone a nyght ther as she lay
With steerne face  and with ful trouble cheere
And seyde thus  Grisilde quod he that day
That I yow took out of youre poure array
And putte yow in estat of heigh noblesse
Ye haue nat that forgeten as I gesse
 I seye Grisilde  this present dignitee
In which þat I haue put yow  as I trowe
Maketh yow  nat foryetful for to be
That I yow took in poure estat ful lowe
ffor any wele  ye mote your seluen knowe
Tak hede of euery word  þat I yow seye
Ther is no wight þat hereth it but we tweye
 Ye woot your self wel  how þat ye cam heere
In to this hous  it is nat longe ago
And thogh to me  þat ye be lief and deere
Vn to my gentils  ye be no thyng so
They seyn  to hem  it is greet shame and wo
ffor to be subgitz  and been in seruage
To thee  that born art of a smal village
 d namely  sith thy doghter was ybore
Thise wordes  han they spoken doutelees
But I desire  as I haue doon bifore
To lyue my lyf with hem  in reste and pees
I may nat in this cas be recchelees
I moot doon with thy doghter  for the beste
Nat as I wolde  but as my peple leste
 And yet god woot this is ful looth to me
But nathelees  with outen youre wityng
I wol nat doon  but this wol I quod he
That ye to me assente  as in this thyng
  
Shewe now youre pacience  in youre wirkyng
That ye me highte  and swore in yone village
That day  þat maked was oure mariage
 Whan she hadde herd al this  she noght ameued
Neither in word  or cheere  or contenance
ffor as it semed  she was nat agreued
She seyde lord  al lith in youre plesance
My child and I  with hertly obeisance
Been youres al  and ye mowe saue or spille
Youre owene thyng werketh after youre wille
 Ther may no thyng god so my soule saue
Liken to yow  þat may displesen me
Ne I ne desire  no thyng for to haue
Ne drede for to lese  saue oonly thee 
This wyl is in myn herte  and ay shal be
No lengthe of tyme  or deth may this deface
Ne chaunge my corage  to oother place
 Glad was this Markys  of hir answeryng
But yet he feyned  as he were nat so
Al drery was his cheere  and his lookyng
Whan þat he sholde  out of the chambre go
Soone after this  a furlang wey or two
He pryuely  hath told al his entente
Vn to a man  and to his wyf hym sente
 A maner sergeant was this priuee man  
The which þat feithful ofte  he founden hadde
In thynges grete  and eek swich folk wel kan
Doon execucion  in thynges badde
The lord knew wel  that he m loued and dradde
And whan this sergeant wiste his lordes wille
In to the chambre  he stalked hym ful stille
  
 Madame he seyde  ye mote foryeue it me
Thogh I do thyng to which I am constreyned
Ye ben so wys  þat ful wel knowe ye
That lordes hestes  mowe nat ben yfeyned
They mowe wel been  biwailled  or compleyned
But men mote nede  vn to hir lust obeye
And so wol I  ther is namoore to seye
 This child  I am comaunded for to take
And spak namoore  but out the child he hente
Despitously  and gan a cheere make
As thogh he wolde  han slayn it er he wente
Grisildis moot al suffre  and al consente
And as a lamb  she sitteth meke and stille
And leet this crewel sergeant doon his wille
 Suspecious was  the diffame of this man
Suspect his face  suspect his word also
Suspect the tyme  in which he this bigan
Allas hir doghter  þat she loued so
She wende  he wolde  han slayn it right tho
But nathelees  she neither weepe ne syked
Conformynge hire  to that the Markys liked
 But at the laste  speken she bigan
And mekely  she to the sergeant preyde
So as he was  a worthy gentil man
That she moste kisse hir child  er þat it deyde
And on hir barm  this litel child she leyde
With ful sad face  and gan the child to blesse
And lulled it and after gan it kesse
 nd thus she seyde  in hir benygne voys
ffare wel my child  I shal thee neuere see
But sith I thee  haue marked with the croys
Of thilke fader  blessed mote he be
  
That for vs deyde  vp on a croys of tree
Thy soule litel child  I hym bitake
ffor this nyght shaltow dyen for my sake
 I trowe  that to a Norice in this cas
It hadde been hard  this routhe for to se
Wel myghte a moder  haue cryd allas
But nathelees  so sad stedefast was she
That she endured  al aduersitee
And to the Sergeant mekely she sayde
Haue here agayn  youre litel yonge mayde
 Goth now quod she  and doth my lordes heste
But o thyng wol I pray yow  of youre grace
That but my lord  forbad yow at the leeste
Burieth this litel body  in som place
That bestes  ne no bryddes  it torace
But he no word  wol to that purpos seye
But took the child  and wente vp on his weye
 This sergeant cam  vn to his lord agayn
And of Grisildis wordes  and hir cheere
He tolde hym poynt for poynt in short and playn
And hym presenteth  with his doghter deere
Som what this lord  hadde routhe in his manere
But nathelees  his purpos held he stille
As lordes doon  whan they wol han hir wille
 And bad this Sergeant þat he pryuely
Sholde this child  softe wynde and wrappe
With alle circumstances tendrely
And carie it in a cofre  or in a lappe
But vp on peyne  his heed of for to swappe
That no man sholde knowe  of this entente
Ne whennes he cam  ne whider þat he wente
  
 But at Boloigne  he to his suster deere  
That thilke tyme  of Pauyk was Countesse
He sholde it take  and shewe hire this matere
Bisekynge hire  to doon hir bisynesse
This child to fostre  in alle gentilesse
And whos child þat it was  he bad hire hyde
ffrom euery wight for aught þat may bityde
 The Sergeant goth  and hath fulfild this thyng
But to this Markys  now retourne we
ffor now goth he  ful faste ymagynyng
If by his wyues cheere  he myghte se
Or by hir word aparceyue  that she
Were chaunged  but he neuere hir koude fynde
But euere in oon  ylike sad and kynde
 As glad  as humble  as busy in seruyse
And eek in loue  as she was wont to be
Was she to hym  in euery maner wise
Ne of hir doghter  noght a word spak she
Noon accident for noon aduersitee
Was seyn in hire  ne neuere hir doghter name
Ne nempned she  in ernest ne in game
IN this estat ther passed ben 4 yeer
Er she with childe was  but as god wolde
A knaue child she bar  by this Walter
fful gracious  and fair for to biholde
And whan þat folk  it to his fader tolde
Nat oonly he  but al his contre merye
Was for this child  and god they thanke and herye
 Whan it was two yeer old  and fro the brest  
Departed of his Norice  on a day
This Markys  caughte yet another lest
  
To tempte his wyf  yet ofter  if he may
O nedelees  was she tempted in assay
But wedded men  ne knowe no mesure
Whan þat they fynde  a pacient creature
 Wyf quod this Markys  ye han herd er this
My peple  sikly berth this mariage
And namely  sith my sone yborn is
Now is it worse  than euere in al oure age
The murmur sleeth myn herte  and my corage
ffor to myne erys  comth the voys so smerte
That it wel neigh  destroyed hath myn herte
 Now sey they thus  whan Walter is agon
Thanne shal  the blood of Ianycle succede
And been oure lord  for oother haue we noon
Swiche wordes  seith my peple out of drede
Wel oghte I  of swich murmur taken hede
ffor certeinly  I drede swich sentence
Though they nat pleyn  speke in myn audience
 I wolde lyue in pees  if þat I myghte
Wherfore  I am disposed outrely
As I his suster  serued by nyghte
Right so thenke I  to serue hym priuely
This warne I yow  þat ye nat sodeynly
Out of your self  for no wo sholde outraye
Beth pacient and ther of I yow praye
 I haue quod she seyd thus  and euere shal
I wol no thyng ne nyl no thyng certeyn
But as yow list noght greueth me at al
Thogh that my doghter  and my sone be sleyn
At youre comandement this is to seyn
I haue nat had no part of children tweyne
But first siknesse  and after wo and peyne
  
 Ye ben oure lord  dooth with youre owene thyng  
Right as yow list axeth no reed of me
ffor as I lefte at hom  al my clothyng
Whan I first cam to yow  right so quod she
Lefte I my wyl  and al my libertee
And took youre clothyng wherfore I yow preye
Dooth youre plesance  I wol youre lust obeye
 And certes  if I hadde prescience
Youre wyl to knowe  er ye youre lust me tolde
I wolde it doon  with outen necligence
But now I woot youre lust and what ye wolde
Al youre plesance  ferm and stable I holde
ffor wiste I  þat my deeth  wolde doon yow ese
Right gladly wolde I dyen  yow to plese
 Deeth may nat make  no comparisoun
Vnto your love And whan this Marqys say
The constance of hys wyf  he caste adoun
Hise eyen two  and wondreth þat she may
In pacience  suffre al this array
And forth he goth  with drery contenance
But to his herte  it was ful gret plesance
 This vggly sergeant in the same wyse
That he hir doghter caughte  right so he
Or worse  if men worse kan deuyse
Hath hent hir sone  þat ful was of beautee
And euere in oon  so pacient was she
That she  no cheere made of heuynesse
But kiste hir sone  and after gan it blesse
 Saue this she prayde hym  þat if he myghte
Hir litel sone  he wolde in erthe graue
His tendre lymes  delicat to sighte
ffro foweles  and fro bestes  hem to saue
  
But she noon answere  of hym myghte haue
He wente his wey  as hym no thyng roghte
But to Boloigne  he tendrely it broghte
his Markys wondreth  euer lenger the moore
Vp on hir pacience  and if þat he
Ne hadde soothly  knowen ther bifoore
That parfitly  hir children loued she
He wolde haue wend  þat of som subtiltee
And of malice  or of cruel corage
That she hadde suffred this  with sad visage
 But wel he knew  þat next hym self certayn
She loued hir children best in euery wise
But now of wommen  wolde I asken fayn
If thise assayes  myghte nat suffise
What koude a sturdy housbond  moore deuyse
To proue hir wifhod  and hir stedfastnesse
And he contynuynge  euere in sturdynesse
 But ther ben folk  of swich condicion
That whan they haue  a certeyn purpos take
They kan nat stynte  of hir entencion
But right as they were bounden to that stake
They wol nat of that firste purpos slake
Right so this Markys  fulliche hath purposed
To tempte his wyf  as he was first disposed
 He wayteth  if by word  or contenance
That she to hym  was chaunged of corage
But neuere  koude he fynde variance
She was ay oon  in herte and in visage
And ay the ferther  þat she was of age
The moore trewe  if þat were possible
She was to hym in loue  and moore penyble
  
 ffor which it semed thus  þat of hem two
Ther nas but o wyl  for as Walter leste
The same lust was hir plesance also
And god be thanked  al fyl for the beste
She shewed wel  for no worldly vnreste
A wif as of hir self no thyng ne sholde
Wille in effect but as hir housbond wolde
 The sclaundre of Walter  ofte and wyde spradde  
That of a cruel herte  he wikkedly
ffor he  a poure womman  wedded hadde
Hath mordred  bothe his children pryuely
Swich murmur  was among hem comunly
No wonder is  for to the peples ere
Ther cam no word  but þat they mordred were
 ffor which  wher as his peple ther bifore
Hadde loued hym wel  the sclaundre of his diffame
Made hem  that they hym hated therfore
To ben a mordrere  is an hateful name
But natheles  for ernest ne for game
He  of his cruel purpos nolde stente
To tempte his wyf  was set al his entente
 Whan that this doghter xij yer was of age
He to the court of Rome  in subtil wise
Enformed of his wil  sente his message
Comaundynge hem  swiche bulles to deuyse
As to his cruel purpos  may suffise
How þat the pope  as for his peples reste
Bad hym to wedde  another if hym leste
 I seye  he bad they sholde contrefete
The popes bulles  makyng mencion
That he hath leue  his firste wyf to lete
As by the popes dispensacion
  
To stynte rancour  and dissencion
Bitwix his peple and hym  thus seyde the bulle
The which  they han publissed at the fulle
 The rude peple  as it no wonder is
Wenden ful wel  þat it hadde ben right so
But whan thise tidynges  cam to Grisildis
I deme  that hir herte was ful wo
But she  ylike sad for euere mo
Disposed was  this humble creature
Thaduersitee of ffortune  al tendure
 Abidynge euere  his lust and his plesance  
To whom þat she was yeuen  herte and al
As to hire  verray worldly suffisance
But shortly  if this storie I tellen shal
This Markys  writen hath in special
A lettre  in which  he sheweth his entente
And secrely  he to Boloigne it sente
 To the Erl of Pavyk which þat hadde tho
Wedded his suster  prayde he specially
To bryngen hom agayn  his children two
In honurable estat al openly
But o thyng he hym prayde outrely
That he to no wight thgh men wolde enquere
Sholde nat tellen  whos children þat they were
 But seye  the mayden sholde ywedded be
Vn to the Markys of Saluce  anon
And as this Erl was prayd  so dide he
ffor at day set he on his wey is gon
Toward Saluce  and lordes many oon
In riche array  this mayden for to gyde
Hir yonge brother  ridyng hir bisyde
  
 Arrayed was  toward hir mariage
This fresshe mayde  ful of gemmes clere
Hir brother  which þat seuen yeer was of age
Arrayed eek ful fressh in his manere
And thus in gret noblesse  and with glad cheere
Toward Saluces  shapyng hir iourney
ffro day to day  they ryden in hir wey
Among al this  after his wikke vsage
This Markys yet his wif to tempte moore
To the outreste preue  of hir corage
ffully to han  experience and loore
If that she were  as stedefast as bifore
He on a day  in open audience
fful boystously  hath seyd hire this sentence
 Certes Grisilde  I hadde ynogh plesance
To han yow to my wyf  for youre goodnesse
And for youre trouthe  and for youre obeysance
Noght for youre lynage  ne for youre richesse
But now knowe I  in verray sothfastnesse
That in gret lordshipe  if I wel auyse
Ther is gret seruitute  in sondry wyse
 I may nat do  as euery Plowman may
My peple  me constreyneth for to take
Another wyf  and cryen day by day
And eek the pope  rancour for to slake
Consenteth it that dar I vndertake
And trewely  thus muche I wol yow seye
My newe wif  is comynge by the weye
 Be strong of herte  and voyde anon hir place
And thilke dowere  þat ye broghten me
Tak it agayn  I graunte it of my grace
  
Retourneth  to youre fadres hous quod he
No man may  alwey han prosperitee
With euene herte  I rede yow tendure
The strook  of ffortune  or of auenture
 And she agayn  answerde in pacience
My lord quod she  I woot and wiste alway
How þat bitwixen  youre magnificence
And my pouerte  no wight kan ne may
Maken comparison  it is no nay
I ne heeld me neuere digne  in no manere
To be youre wyf no ne youre chambrere
And in this hous  ther ye me lady made  
The heighe god take I  for my witnesse
And also wisly  he my soule glade
I neuere heeld me lady  ne maistresse
But humble seruant to youre worthynesse
And euere shal  whil þat my lyf may dure
Abouen  euery worldly creature
 That ye so longe  of youre benygnytee
Han holden me  in honour and nobleye
Where as I was  noght worthy for to be
That thonke I god and yow  to whom I preye
fforyelde it yow  ther is namoore to seye
Vn to my fader  gladly wol I wende
And with hym dwelle  vn to my lyues ende
 Ther I was fostred  of a child ful smal
Til I be deed  my lyf ther wol I lede
A wydewe clene  in body  herte  and al
ffor sith  I yaf to yow  my maydenhede
And am youre trewe wyf  it is no drede
God shilde  swich a lordes wyf to take
Another man  to housbond  or to make
  
 And of youre newe wyf  god of his grace
So graunte yow  wele and prosperitee
ffor I wol gladly  yelden hire my place
In which  þat I was blisful wont to be
ffor sith it liketh yow  my lord quod she
That whilom weren  al myn hertes reste
That I shal goon  I wol goon whan yow leste
 But ther as ye  me profre swich dowaire
As I first broghte  it is wel in my mynde
It were my wrecched clothes  no thyng faire
The whiche to me  were hard now for to fynde
O goode god  how gentil  and how kynde
Ye semed  by youre speche  and youre visage
The day  that maked was oure mariage
 But sooth is seyd  algate I fynde it trewe  
ffor in effect it proued is on me
Loue is noght old  as whan þat it is newe
But certes lord  for noon aduersitee
To dyen in this cas  it shal nat be
That euere in word or werk I shal repente
That I yow yaf myn herte  in hool entente
 My lord ye woot þat in my fadres place
Ye dide me strepe  out of my poure wede
And richely  me cladden of youre grace
To yow broghte I  noght ellis out of drede
But feith  and nakednesse  and maydenhede
And here agayn  my clothyng I restore
And eek my weddyngryng for euere moore
 The remenant of youre Iewels  redy be
In with youre chambre  dar I saufly sayn
Naked  out of my fadres hous quod she
I cam  and naked moot I turne agayn
  
Al youre plesance  wol I folwen fayn
But yet I hope  it be nat youre entente
That I smoklees  out of youre palays wente
 Ye koude nat doon  so dishoneste a thyng
That thilke wombe  in which youre children leye
Sholde biforn the peple  in my walkyng
Be seyn al bare  wher fore I yow preye
Lat me  nat lyk a worm  go by the weye
Remembre yow  myn owene lord so deere
I was youre wyf  thogh I vnworthy weere
 Wher fore  in gerdon of my maydenhede
Which þat I broghte  and noght agayn I bere
As voucheth sauf to yeue me to my mede
But swich a smok as I was wont to were
That I ther with  may wrye the wombe of here
That was youre wyf  and here take I my leeue
Of yow myn owene lord  lest I yow greeue
 The smok quod he  that thow hast on thy bak  
Lat it be stille  and bere it forth with thee
But wel vnnethes  thilke word he spak
But wente his wey  for routhe and for pitee
Biforn the folk  hir seluen strepeth shee
And in hir smok with heued and feet al bare
Toward hir fader hous  forth is she fare
 The folk hir folwen  wepynge in hir weye
And ffortune  ay they cursen as they goon
But she fro wepyng kepte hir eyen dreye
Ne in this tyme  word ne spak she noon
Hir fader  that this tidynge herde anon
Curseth the day and tyme  þat nature
Shoope hym  to been a lyues creature
  
 ffor out of doute  this olde poure man
Was euere  in suspect of hir mariage
ffor euere he demed  sith þat it bigan
That whan the lord  fulfild hadde his corage
Hym wolde thynke  it were a disparage
To his estat so lowe for talighte
And voyden hire  as soone as euere he myghte
 Agayns his doghter  hastiliche goth he
ffor he by noyse of folk  knew hir comynge
And with hir olde cote  as it myghte be
He couered hire  ful sorwefully wepynge
But on hir body  myghte he it nat brynge
ffor rude was the clooth  and she moore of age
By dayes fele  than at hir mariage
 Thus with hir fader  for a certein space
Dwelleth this flour  of wifly pacience
That neyther  by hir wordes  ne hir face
Biforn the folk ne eek in hir absence
Ne shewed she  þat hir was doon offence
Ne of hir heighe estat no remembrance
Ne hadde she  as by hir contenance
 No wonder is  for in hir grete estat  
Hir goost was euere  in pleyn humylitee
No tendre mouth  noon herte delicat
No pompe  no semblant of realtee
But ful  of pacient benygnytee
Discreet and pridelees  ay honurable
And to hir housbonde  euere meke and stable
 Men speke of Iob  and moost for his humblenesse
As clerkes whan hem lest konne wel endite
Namely of men  but as in soothfastnesse
Thogh clerkes  preyse wommen but a lite
  
Ther kan no man  in humblesse hym acquite
As wommen kan  ne kan be half so trewe
As wommen been  but it be falle of newe
 ffro Boloigne  is this Erl of Pavyk come
Of which the fame vp sprong to moore and lesse
And to the peples erys  alle and some
Was kouth eek þat a newe Markisesse
He with hym broghte  in swich pompe and richesse
That neuere was ther seyn  with mannes eye
So noble array  in al westlumbardye
 The Markys  which þat shoope  and knew al this
Er that this Erl was come  sente his message
ffor thilke  sely  poure Grisildis
And she with humble herte  and glad visage
Nat with no swollen thoght in hir corage
Cam at his heste  and on hir knees hir sette
And reuerently  and wysly she hym grette
 Grisilde quod he  my wil is outrely
This mayden  þat shal wedded been to me
Receyued be tomorwe  as really
As it possible is  in myn hous to be
And eek that euery wight in his degree
Haue his estat in sittyng and seruyse
And heigh plesance  as I kan best deuyse
 haue no wommen suffisant certayn
The chambres for taraye  in ordynance
After my lust and ther fore wolde I fayn
That thyn were  al swich manere gouernance
Thow knowest eek of old al my plesance
Though thyn array be badde  and yuel biseye
Do thow thy deuoir  at the leeste weye
  
 Nat oonly lord  that I am glad  quod she
To doon youre lust but I desire also
Yow for to serue  and plese in my degree
With outen feyntyng and shal euere mo
Ne neuere  for no wele  ne no wo
Ne shal the goost with Inne myn herte stente
To loue yow best with al my trewe entente
 And with that word  she gan the hous to dighte
And tables for to sette  and beddes make
And peyned hire  to doon al that she myghte
Preyynge the chambreres  for goddes sake
To hasten hem  and faste swepe and shake
And she  the mooste seruysable of alle
Hath euery chambre arrayed  and his halle
 Abouten vndren  gan this Erl alighte
That with hym broghte  thise noble children tweye
ffor which the peple  ran to seen the sighte
Of hire array  so richely biseye
And thanne at erst  amonges hem they seye
That Walter was no fool  thogh þat hym leste
To chaunge his wyf for it was for his beste
 ffor she is fairer  as they demen alle
Than is Grisilde  and moore tendre of age
And fairer fruyt bitwene hem sholde falle
And moore plesant for hire heigh lynage
Hir brother eek  so fair was of visage
That hem to seen  the peple hath caught plesance
Commendynge now  the Markys gouernance
 O stormy peple  vnsad  and euere vntrewe  
Ay vndiscreet and chaungyng as a vane
Delitynge euere in rumbel  þat is newe
ffor lyk the moone  ay wexe ye and wane
  
Ay ful of clappyng deere ynow a Iane
Youre doom is fals  youre constance yuele preueth
A ful greet fool is he  that on yow leueth
 Thus seyden sadde folk in that Citee
Whan that the peple  gazed vp and doun
ffor they were glad  right for the noueltee
To han  a newe lady  of hir town
Namoore of this  make I now mencioun
But to Grisilde agayn  wol I me dresse
And telle hir constance  and hir bisynesse
 fful bisy was Grisilde  in euery thyng
That to the feste  was apertinent
Right noght was she abayst of hir clothyng
Thogh it were rude  and somdel eek torent
But with glad cheere  to the yate is she went
With oother folk to greete the Markysesse
And after that dooth forth hir bisynesse
 With so glad cheere  his gestes she receyueth
And so konnyngly  euerich in his degree
That no defaute  no man aparceyueth
But ay they wondren  what she myghte be
That in so poure array  was for to se
And koude swich honour  and reuerence
And worthily  they preysen hir prudence
 In al this mene while  she ne stente
This mayde  and eek hir brother to commende
With al hir herte  in ful benygne entente
So wel  þat no man koude hir prys amende
But at the laste  whan þat thise lordes wende
To sitten doun to mete  he gan to calle
Grisilde  as she was bisy in his halle
  
 Grisilde quod he  as it were in his pley  
How liketh thee my wyf  and hir beautee
Right wel quod she my lord  for in good fey
A fairer  saw I neuere noon  than she
I prey to god  yeue hire prosperitee
And so hope I  þat he wol to yow sende
Plesance ynough  vn to youre lyues ende
 O thyng biseke I yow  and warne also
That ye ne prike  with no tormentynge
This tendre mayden  as ye han do mo
ffor she is fostred  in hir norissynge
Moore tendrely  and to my supposynge
She koude nat aduersitee endure
As koude  a poure fostred creature
 And whan this Walter  saw hir pacience
Hir glad cheere  and no malice at al
And he so ofte  had doon to hire offence
And she ay sad  and constant as a wal
Continuynge euere  hir Innocence ouer al
This sturdy Markys  gan his herte dresse
To rewen  vp on hir wyfly stedfastnesse
 This is ynogh  Grisilde myn quod he
Be now namoore agast ne yuele apayed
I haue thy feith  and thy benygnytee
As wel  as euere womman was assayed
In greet estat and poureliche arrayed
Now knowe I deere wyf  thy stedfastnesse
And hire in armes took  and gan hir kesse
 And she for wonder  took of it no keepe
She herde nat what thyng he to hir seyde
She ferde  as she hadde stirt out of a sleepe
Til she  out of hir mazednesse abreyde
  
Grisilde quod he  by god þat for vs deyde
Thow art my wyf  noon oother I haue
Ne neuere hadde  as god my soule saue
 This is thy doghter  which thow hast supposed  
To be my wyf  that oother feithfully
Shal be myn heir  as I haue ay supposed
Thow bare hym  in thy body trewely
At Boloigne  haue I kept hem priuely
Tak hem agayn  for now maistow nat seye
That thow hast lorn  noon of thy children tweye
 And folk  þat oother weys  han seyd of me
I warne hem wel  þat I haue doon this dede
ffor no malice  ne for no crueltee
But for tassaye in thee  thy wommanhede
And nat to sleen my children  god forbede
But for to kepe hem  pryuely and stille
Til I thy purpos knewe  and al thy wille
 Whan she this herde   aswowne doun she falleth
ffor pitous ioye  and after hir swownynge
She bothe hir yonge children  vn to hire calleth
And in hir armes  pitously wepynge
Embraceth hem  and tendrely kissynge
fful lyk a moder  with hir salte terys
She batheth  bothe hir visage and hir herys
 O which a pitous thyng it was to se
Hir swownyng and hir humble voys to heere
Grant mercy lord  god thanke it yow  quod she
That ye han saued me  my children deere
Now rekke I neuere  to been ded right heere
Sith I stonde in youre loue  and in youre grace
No fors of deeth  ne whan my spirit pace
  
 O tendre  o deere  o yonge children myne
Youre woful moder  wende stedefastly
That cruel houndes  or som foul vermyne
Hadde eten yow  but god of his mercy
And youre benygne fader  tendrely
Hath doon yow kept and in that same stounde
Al sodeynly  she swapte adoun to grounde
 And in hir swogh  so sadly holdeth she  
Hir children two  whan she gan hem tembrace
That with greet sleghte  and greet difficultee
The children from hir arm  they gonne arace
O many a teer  o many a pitous face
Doun ran  of hem þat stoden hir bisyde
Vnnethe aboute hire  myghte they abyde
 Walter hir gladeth  and hir sorwe slaketh
She riseth vp abaysed  from hir traunce
And euery wight hir ioye and feste maketh
Til she  hath caught agayn hir contenance
Walter hir dooth  so feithfully plesance
That it was deyntee  for to seen the cheere
Bitwix hem two  now they ben met yfeere
 Thise ladies  whan þat they  hir tyme say
Han taken hire  and in to chambre goon
And strepen hire  out of hir rude aray
And in a clooth of gold  þat brighte shoon
With a coroune  of many a riche stoon
Vp on hir hed  they in to halle hir broghte
And ther she was  honured as hir oghte
 Thus hath this pitous day  a blisful ende
ffor euery man and womman  dooth his myght
This day  in murthe and reuel to dispende
Til on the welkne  shoon the sterres lyght
  
ffor moore solempne  in euery mannes syght
This feste was  and gretter of costage
Than was  the reuel of hir mariage
 fful many a yeer  in heigh prosperitee
Lyuen thise two  in concord and in reste
And richely  his doghter maried he
Vn to a lord  oon of the worthyeste
Of al Ytaille  and thanne in pees and reste
His wyues fader  and his court he kepeth
Til that the soule  out of his body crepeth
 His sone  succedeth in his heritage  
In reste and pees  after his fader day
And fortunat was eek his mariage
Al putte he nat his wyf in gret assay
This world is nat so strong it is no nay
As it hath been  in olde tymes yore
And herkneth  what this Auctour seith therfore
 This storie is seyd  nat for þat wyues sholde


ffolwen Grisilde  as in humylitee
ffor it were importable  thogh they wolde
But for þat euery wight in his degree
Sholde be constant in aduersitee
As was Grisilde  therfore Petrak writeth
This storie  which he with heigh stile enditeth 
 ffor sith a womman  was so pacient
Vn to a mortal man  wel moore vs oghte
Receyuen al in gree  that god vs sent
ffor gret skile is  he preue that he wroghte
But he ne tempteth  no man þat he boghte
As seith Seint Iame  if ye his pistel rede
He preueth folk al day  it is no drede
  
 And suffreth vs  as for oure exercise
With sharpe scourges  of aduersitee
fful ofte to be bete  in sondry wise
Nat for to knowe oure wyl  for certes he
Er we were born  knew al oure freletee
And for oure beste  is al his gouernance
Let vs thanne lyue  in vertuous suffrance
 But o word lordynges  herkneth er I go
It were ful hard  to fynde now a dayes
In al a town  Grisildis thre or two
ffor if þat they were put to swiche assayes
The gold of hem  hath now so badde alayes
With bras  that thogh the coigne  be fair at eye
It wolde rather  breste atwo than plye
 ffor which heere  for the wyues loue of Bathe  
Whos lyf and al hir secte  god mayntene
In heigh maistrie  or ellis were it scathe
I wol with lusty herte  fressh and grene
Seye yow a song to glade yow I wene
And lat vs stynte  of ernestful matere
Herkneth my song that seith in this manere
GRisilde is deed  and eek hir pacience
And bothe atones  buryed in Ytaille
ffor which I crye  in open audience
No wedded man  so hardy be tasssaille
His wyues pacience  in trust to fynde
Grisildis  for in certein he shal faille
  
 O noble wyues  ful of heigh prudence
Lat noon humilitee  youre tonge nayle
Ne lat no clerk  haue cause or diligence
To write of yow  a storie of swich meruaile
As of Grisildis  pacient and kynde
Lest Chichyuache  yow swelwe in hir entrayle
 ffolweth Ekko  that holdeth no silence
But euere answereth  at the countretaile
Beth nat bidaffed  for youre Innocence
But sharply  tak on yow the gouernaile
Emprinteth wel  this lesson in youre mynde
ffor commune profit sith it may auaile
 Ye Archewyues  stondeth at defense  
Syn ye be strong as is a gret Camaile
Ne suffreth nat þat men yow doon offense
And sklendre wyues  fieble as in bataile
Beth egre  as is a tigre yond in Ynde
Ay clappeth as a Mille  I yow consaile
 Ne dreed hem nat dooth hem no reuerence
ffor thogh thyn housbond  armed be in maile
The arwes  of thy crabbed eloquence
Shal perce his brest and eek his auentaile
In Ialousie  I rede eek thow hym bynde
And thow shalt make hym couche  as dooth a Quaile
 If thow be fair  ther folk ben in presence
Shewe thow thy visage  and thyn aparaile
If thow be foul  be fre of thy dispence
To gete thee freendes  ay do thy trauaile
Be ay of cheere  as light as leef on lynde
And lat hym care and wepe  and wrynge and wayle
 This worthy Clerk whan ended was his tale
Oure hoost seyde  and swoor by goddes bones
Me were leuere  than a barel ale
My wyf at hom  had herd this legende ones
This is  a gentil tale for the nones
As to my purpos  wiste ye my wille
But thyng that wol nat be  lat it be stille

THer was  as telleth Titus Liuius
A knyght that called was Virginius
ffulfild of honour  and of worthynesse
And strong of freendes  and of greet richesse
 This knyght a doghter hadde by his wif
Ne children hadde he mo  in al his lif
ffair was this mayde  in excellent beautee
Abouen euery wight þat man may see
ffor Nature hath  with souereyn diligence
Yformed hire  in so greet excellence
As thogh she wolde seyn  lo I nature
Thus kan I forme  and peynte a creature
Whan þat me list who kan me countrefete
Pigmalion noght thogh he ay forge and bete
Or graue  or peynte  for I dar wel seyn
Apelles Zanzis  sholde werche in veyn
Outher to graue  or peynte  or forge  or bete
If they presumeden  me to countrefete
ffor he that is  the formere principal
Hath maked me  his vicaire general
To forme and peynten  erthely creaturis
Right as me list and ech thyng in my cure is
Vnder the Moone  that may wane and waxe
And for my werk right no thyng wol I axe
  
My lord and I  been ful of oon acord
I made hire  to the worshipe of my lord
So do I  alle myne othere creatures
What colour þat they han  or what figures
Thus semeth me  that nature wolde seye
This mayde of age  xij yeer was and tweye
In which þat nature  hadde swich delit
ffor  right as she kan peynte a lilye whit
And reed a Rose  right with swich peynture
She peynted hath  this noble creature
Er she were born  vpon hir lymes free
Wher as by right swiche colours sholden be
And Phebus  dyed hath hir tresses grete  
Lyk to the stremys  of his burned hete
And if þat excellent was hir beautee
A thousand fold  moore vertuous was she
In hire  ne lakked no condicion
That is to preyse  as by discrecion
As wel in goost as body  chaast was she
ffor which  she floured in virginitee
With all humilitee  and abstinence
With all atemperance  and pacience
With mesure eek  of beryng and array
Discreet she was  in answeryng alway
Thogh she were wise Pallas  dar I seyn
Hir facound eek  ful wommanly and pleyn
No countrefeted termes  hadde she
To seme wys  but after hir degree
She spak and alle hir wordes  moore and lesse
Sownynge in vertu  and in gentilesse
Shamefast she was  in maydens shamefastnesse
Constant in herte  and euere in bisynesse
To dryue hire out of ydel slogardye
Bacus hadde of hir mouth  right no maistrye
ffor wyn and youthe  dooth Venus encresse
As men in fyr  wil casten oille  or gresse
  
And of hir owene vertu  vnconstreyned
She hath ful ofte tyme  syk hir feyned
ffor þat she wolde  fleen the compaignye
Where likly was  to treten of folye
As is at festes  reuels  and at daunces
That been occasions  of daliaunces
Swich thyng maken children for to be
To soone rype  and boold  as men may se
Which is ful perilous  and hath be yoore
ffor al to soone  may they lerne loore
Of boldnesse  whan she woxe is a wyf
 And ye Maistresses  in youre olde lyf
That lordes doghtres  han in gouernance
Ne taketh of my wordes  no displesance
Thenketh  þat ye been set in gouernynges
Of lordes doghtres  oonly for two thynges
 Owther  for ye han kept youre honestee  
Or ellis  ye han falle in freletee
And knowen wel ynow  the olde daunce
And han forsaken fully  swich meschaunce
ffor euere mo  therfore  for Cristes sake
To teche hem vertu  looke þat ye ne slake
 A theef of venyson  that hath forlaft
His likerousnesse  and al his olde craft
Kan kepe a fforest best of any man
Now kepeth wel  for if ye wole ye kan
Looke wel þat ye  vnto no vice assente
Lest ye be dampned  for youre wikke entente
ffor who so dooth  a traytour is certeyn
And taketh kepe  of that þat I shal seyn
Of alle treson  souerayn pestilence
Is  whan a wight bitrayseth Innocence
 Ye fadres  and ye modres eek also
Thogh ye han children  be it oon or mo
Youre is the charge  of al hir surueance
Whil þat they been  vnder youre gouernance
  
Beth war  if by ensample of youre lyuynge
Or by youre necligence  in chastisynge
That they perisse  for I dar wel seye
If þat they doon  ye shul it deere abeye
Vnder a Shepherde  softe and necligent
The wolf hath many a sheepe  and lomb torent
Suffiseth oon ensample  now as heere
ffor I moot turne agayn to my matere
 This mayde of which  I wol this tale expresse
So kepte hir self hir neded no maistresse
ffor in hir lyuyng maydens myghten rede
As in a book euery good word  or dede
That longeth  to a mayden vertuous
She was so prudent and so bounteuous
ffor which the fame out sproong on euery syde
Bothe of hir beautee  and hir bountee  wyde
That thurgh that land  they preysed hire echone
That loued vertu  saue enuye allone
That sory is  of oother mennes wele
And glad is  of his sorwe  and his vnheele
The doctor  maketh this discripcioun  
This mayde  vpon a day  wente in the toun
Toward a temple  with hir moder deere
As is  of yonge maydens the manere
 Now was ther thanne  a Iustice in that toun
That gouernour was  of that Regioun
And so bifel  this Iuge hise eyen caste
Vpon this mayde  auysynge hym ful faste
As she cam forby  ther as this Iuge stood
Anoon his herte chaunged  and his mood
So was he caught with beautee of this mayde
And to hym self  ful pryuely he sayde
This mayde shal be myn  for any man
Anon the feend  into his herte ran
And taughte hym sodeynly  þat he by slyghte
This mayden  to his purpos wynne myghte
  
ffor certes  by no force  ne by no meede
Hym thoughte  he was nat able for to speede
ffor she was strong of freendes  and eek she
Confermed was  in swich souerayn bountee
That wel he wiste  he myghte hir neuere wynne
As for to make hire  with hir body synne
ffor which  by greet deliberacioun
He sente after a cherl  was in the town
Which þat he knew  for subtil and for bold
This Iuge vnto this cherl  his tale hath told
In secree wise  and made hym to ensure
He sholde telle it to no creature
And if he dide  he sholde lese his heed
Whan þat assented was  this cursed reed
Glad was this Iuge  and maked hym gret cheere
And yaf hym yiftes  preciouse and deere
 Whan shapen was  al hir conspiracie
ffro point to point how þat his lecherie
Parfourned sholde been  ful subtilly
As ye shul heere it after openly
 Hom goth the cherl  that highte Claudius
This false Iuge  that highte Apius
So was his name  for this is no fable
But knowen  for historial thyng notable
The sentence of it sooth is out of doute  
This false Iuge  gooth now faste aboute
To hasten his delit al that he may
And so bifel  soone after on a day
This false Iuge  as telleth vs the storie
As he was wont sat in his Consistorie
And yaf his domes  vpon sondry cas
 This false cherl cam forth  a ful gret pas
And seyde  lord if þat it be youre wille
As dooth me right vpon this pitous bille
In which  I pleyne vpon Virginius
And if þat he wol seyn  it is nat thus
  
I wol it preue  and fynde good witnesse
That sooth is  that my bille wol expresse
 This Iuge answerde  of this in his absence
I may nat yeue  diffynytif sentence
Lat do hym calle  and I wol gladly heere
Thow shalt haue al right and no wrong heere
Virginius cam to wite  the Iuges wille
And right anon  was rad this cursed bille
The sentence of it was as ye shul heere
 To yow my lord  sire Apius so deere
Sheweth  youre poure seruant Claudius
How þat a knyght called Virginius
Agayns the lawe  agayn al equitee
Holdeth expres  agayn the wyl of me
My seruant which þat is my thral by right
Which fro myn hous  was stole vpon a nyght
Whil that she was ful yong this wol I preue
By witnesse lord  so þat it nat yow greue
She nys his doghter nat what so he seye
Wher to yow  my lord the Iuge I preye
Yeld me my thral  if þat it be youre wille
Lo  this was al the sentence  of his bille
 Virginius  gan vpon the cherl biholde
But hastily  er he his tale tolde
And wolde haue proued it as sholde a knyght
And eek by witnessynge  of many a wight
That it was fals  that seyde his Aduersarie
This cursed Iuge  wolde no thyng tarie
Ne here a word  moore of Virginius  
But yaf his Iuggement and seyde thus 
 I deme anon  this cherl  his seruant haue
Thou shalt no lenger  in thyn hous hir saue
Go bryng hir forth  and put hire in oure warde
The cherl shal han his thral  this I awarde
 And whan  this worthy knyght Virginius
Thurgh sentence  of this Iustice Apius
  
Moste by force  his deere doghter yeuen
Vnto the Iuge  in lecherie to lyuen
He goth hym hom  and sette hym in his halle
And leet anoon  his deere doghter calle
And with a face deed  as asshen colde
Vpon hir humble face  he gan biholde
With fadres pitee  stikyng thurgh his herte
Al wolde he  from his purpos nat conuerte
 Doghter quod he  Virginia by thy name
Ther been two weyes  outher deeth  or shame
That thow most suffre  allas þat I was bore
ffor neuere  thow deseruedest wherfore
To dyen  with a swerd  or with a knyf
O deere doghter  endere of my lyf
Which I haue fostred vp  with swich plesance
That thow were neuere  out of my remembrance
O doghter  which that art my laste wo
And in my lyf my laste ioye also
O gemme of chastitee  in pacience
Tak thow thy deeth  for this is my sentence
ffor loue  and nat for hate  thow most be deed
My pitous hand  moot smyten of thyn heed
Allas  þat euere Apius thee say
Thus hath he falsly  Iugged thee to day
And tolde hire al the cas  as ye bifore
Han herd  nat nedeth for to telle it moore
 O mercy deere fader  quod this mayde
And with that word  she bothe hir armes layde
Aboute his nekke  as she was wont to do
The teeris borste  out of hir eyen two
And seyde  goode fader  shal I dye
Is ther no grace  is ther no remedye
 No certes  deere doghter myn quod he  
 Thanne yif me leyser  fader myn quod she
My deeth for to compleyne  a litel space
ffor pardee Iepte  yaf his doghter grace  
ffor to compleyne  er he hir slowe allas
And god it woot no thyng was hir trespas
But for she ran  hir fader for to se
To welcome hym  with greet solempnytee
And with that word  she fil aswowne anon
And after  whan hir swownyng is agon
She riseth vp  and to hir fader sayde
Blessed be god  þat I shal dye a mayde
Yif me my deeth  er þat I haue a shame
Dooth with youre child  youre wyl a goddes name
And with that word  she preyed hym ful ofte
That with his swerd  he wolde smyte softe
And with that word  aswowne doun she fil
 Hir fader  with ful sorweful herte and wil
Hir heed of smoot and by the tope it hente
And to the Iuge  he gan it to presente
As he sat yet in doom  in Consistorie
 And whan the Iuge it saw  as seith the storie
He bad to take hym  and anhange hym faste
But right anon  a thousand peple In thraste
To saue the knyght for routhe and for pitee
ffor knowen was  the false Iniquitee
 The peple anon  hadde suspect in this thyng
By manere  of the cherles chalangyng
That it was  by the assent of Apius
They wisten wel  þat he was lecherus
ffor which  vnto this Apius they gon
And caste hym in a prison  right anon
Ther as he slow hym self  and Claudius
That seruant was  vnto this Apius
Was demed  for to hange vp on a tree
But that Virginius  of his pitee
So preyde for hym  that he was exiled
And ellis certes  he hadde been bigyled
The remenant were anhanged  moore and lesse
That were consentant of this cursednesse
  
 Heere may men seen  how synne hath his merite  
Beth war  for no man woot whom god wol smyte
In no degree  ne in which manere wise
The worm of conscience  may agrise
Of wikked lyf  thogh it so pryuee be
That no man woot ther of  but god and he
ffor be he lewed man  or ellis lered
He noot how soone  that he shal been afered
Therfore I rede yow  this conseil take
fforsaketh synne  er synne yow forsake  
Oure Hoost gan to swere  as he were wood
Harrow quod he  by nayles and by blood
This was a fals cherl  and a fals Iustise
As shameful deeth  as herte may deuyse
Come to thise Iuges  and hir Aduocatz
Algate this sely made  is slayn allas
Allas  to deere boghte she beautee
Wherfore I seye alday  þat men may se
That yiftes of ffortune  and of nature
Been cause of deeth  to many a creature
    
    
Of bothe yiftes  þat I speke of now
Men han ful ofte  moore for harm than prow
 But trewely  myn owene maister deere
This is a pitous tale  for to heere
But nathelees passe ouer  is no fors
I pray to god  so saue thy gentil cors
And eek thyne vrynals  and thy Iurdones
Thyn Ypocras  and eek thy galyones
And euery boyste  ful of thy letuarie
God blesse hem  and oure lady Seinte Marie
So mote I then  thow art a propre man
And lyk a prelat  by Seint Ronyan
Seyde I nat wel  I kan nat speke in terme  
But wel I woot thow doost myn herte to erme
That I almoost haue caught a Cardynacle
By corpus bones  but if I haue triacle
Or ellis a draghte  of moyste and corny ale
Or but I heere anon  a murye tale
  
Myn herte is lost for pitee of this mayde
 Thow beel amy  thow Pardoner he sayde
Tel vs som myrthe  or Iapes right anon
 It shal be doon quod he  by Seint Ronyon
But first quod he  heere at this ale stake
I wol bothe drynke  and eten of a Cake
 And right anon  thise gentils gonne to crye
Nay lat hym telle vs  of no ribawdye
Tel vs som moral thyng  þat we may leere
Som wit  and thanne wol we gladly heere
 I graunte ywis quod he  but I moot thynke
Vpon som honeste thyng whil þat I drynke

Lordynges quod he  in chirches whan I preche
I peyne me  to han an hauteyn speche
And rynge it out as round as gooth a belle 
ffor I kan  al by rote that I telle
My theme is alwey oon  and euere was
Radix malorum  est cupiditas
 ffirst I pronounce  whennes þat I come
And thanne my bulles  shewe I alle and some
Oure lige lordes seel  on my patente
That shewe I first my body to warente
That no man be so boold  ne preest ne clerk
Me to destourbe  of Cristes holy werk
And after that thanne telle I forth my tales
Bulles of Popes  and of Cardynales
Of Patriarkes  and Bisshopes I shewe  
And in latyn  I speke a wordes fewe
To saffron with  my predicacion
And for to stire hem  to deuocion
 Thanne shewe I forth  my longe cristal stones
Yerammed ful  of cloutes and of bones
Relikes been they  as wenen they echon
Thanne haue I in a laton  a shulder bon
Which þat was  of an holy Iewes sheepe
Goode men I seye  tak of my wordes keepe
If þat this boon be wasshe  in any welle
If cow  or calf or sheepe  or Oxe swelle
That any worm hath ete  or worm ystonge
Taak water of that welle  and wasshe his tonge
  
And it is hool anoon  and forther moor
Of pokkes  and of Scabbe  and euery soor
Shal euery sheepe be hool  þat of this welle
Drynketh a draughte  taak kepe eek what I telle
 If þat the goode man  þat the bestes oweth
Wol euery wike  er þat the cok hym croweth
ffastynge  drynken of this welle a draghte
As thilke holy Iew  oure eldres taghte
Hise bestes and his stoor  shal multiplie
And sire also  it heeleth Ialousie
ffor thogh a man  be falle in Ialous rage
Lat maken with this water  his potage
And neuere shal he moore  his wyf mystriste
Thogh he the soothe  of hir defaute wiste
Al hadde she  taken preestes  two or thre
 Heere is a Miteyn eek  þat ye may se
He þat his hand  wol putte  in this Mitayn
He shal haue  multiplyyng of his grayn
Whan he hath sowen  be it whete or Otes
So þat  he  offre pens  or ellis grotes
 Goode men and wommen  o thyng warne I yow
If any wight be in this chirche now
That hath doon synne horrible  that he
Dar nat for shame  of it yshryuen be
Or any womman  be she yong or old
That hath ymaked  hir housbond Cokewold
Swich folk shal haue no power  ne no grace  
To offren to my Relikes  in this place
And who so fyndeth hym  out of swich blame
He wol come vp  and offre a goddes name
And I assoille hym  by the auctoritee
Which þat by bulle  ygraunted was to me
 By this gaude  have I wonne  yeer by yeer
An hundred mark sith I was Pardoner
I stonde lyk a Clerk in my pulpet
And whan that lewed peple  is doun yset
  
I preche so  as ye han herd bifore
And telle  an hundred false Iapes more
Thanne peyne I me  to strecche forth the nekke
And Est and west vpon the peple I bekke
As dooth a dowue  sittyng on a berne
Myne handes  and my tonge goon so yerne
That it is ioye  to se my bisynesse
Of Auarice  and of swich cursednesse
Is al my prechyng for to make hem free
To yeuen hir pens  and namely vnto me
ffor myn entente is nat but for to wynne
And no thyng for correccioun of synne
I rekke neuere  whan þat they been beryed
Thogh þat hir soules  goon a blakeberyed
ffor certes  many a predicacion
Comth ofte tyme  of yuel entencion
 Som for plesance of folk and flaterye
To been auanced  by ypocrisie
And som for veyne glorie  and som for hate
ffor whan I dar  noon oother weyes debate
Thanne wol I stynge hym  with my tonge smerte
In prechyng so þat he shal nat asterte
To been diffamed falsly  if þat he
Hath trespased  to my bretheren  or to me
ffor though I telle noght his propre name
Men shal wel knowe  that it is the same
By signes  and by othere circumstances
Thus quyte I folk that doon vs displesances
Thus spete I out my venym vnder hewe
Of holynesse  to seme holy and trewe
But shortly  myn entente I wol deuyse  
I preche of no thyng but for coueitise
Therfore my theme is yet and euere was
Radix malorum  est Cupiditas
 Thus kan I preche  agayn that same vice
Which þat I vse  and that is Auarice
  
But though my self be gilty in that synne
Yet kan I make  oother folk to twynne
ffrom Auarice  and soore to repente
But that is nat my principal entente
I preche no thyng but for coueitise
Of this matere  it oghte ynow suffise
 Thanne telle I hem  ensamples many oon
Of olde stories  longe tyme agoon
ffor lewed peple  louen tales olde
Swiche thynges  kan they wel reporte and holde
What trowe ye  þat whiles I may preche
And wynne  gold and siluer  for I teche
That I wol lyue in pouerte  wilfully
Nay nay  I thoghte it neuere trewely
ffor I wol preche  and begge  in sondry landes
I wol nat do no labour  with myne handes
Ne make baskettes  and lyue ther by
By cause  I wol nat beggen ydelly
I wol  none of the Apostles countrefete
I wol haue moneye  wolle  chese  and whete
Al were it yeuen  of the pouerest page
Or of the pouereste widwe  in a Village
Al sholde hir children  sterue for famyne
Nay I wol drynke  licour of the vyne
And haue a ioly wenche  in euery toun
But herkneth lordynges  in conclusioun
Youre likyng is  þat I shal telle a tale
Now haue I dronke  a draghte of corny Ale
By god I hope  I shal yow telle a thyng
That shal by reson  been at youre likyng
ffor thogh my self be  a ful vicious man
A moral tale  yet I yow telle kan
Which I am wont to preche  for to wynne
Now holde youre pees  my tale I wol bigynne

IN fflandres  whilom was a compaignye  
Of yonge folk that haunteden folye
As Riot hasard  Stewes  and Tauernes
Where as with harpes  lutes  and gyternes
They daunce  and pleyen at dees  bothe day and nyght
And ete also and drynke  ouer hir myght
Thurgh which  they doon the deuel sacrifise
WithInne that deueles temple  in cursed wise
By superfluytee  abhomynable
Hir othes been so grete  and so dampnable
That it is grisly  for to heere hem swere
Oure blissed lordes body  they totere
Hem thoughte  that Iewes  rente hym noght ynough
And eech of hem  at otheres synne lough
And right anon  thanne coomen Tombesteres
ffetys and smale  and yonge ffrutesteres
Syngeris with harpes  Baudes  waufereres
Whiche been  the verray deueles Officers
To kyndle and blowe  the fyr of lecherye
That is annexed  vnto glotonye
The holy writ take I  to my witnesse
That luxure  is in wyn  and dronkenesse
 Lo how þat dronken loth  vnkyndely
Lay by his doghtres two  vnwityngly
So dronke he was  he nyste what he wroghte
Herodes  who so wel the stories soghte

     6text p 319
Whan he of wyn was replet at his feste
Right at his owene table  he yaf his heste
To sleen the Baptist Iohn  ful giltelees
Senec seith a good word doutelees
 He seith  he kan no difference fynde
Bitwix a man  that is out of his mynde
And a man  which þat is dronkelewe
But that woodnesse  yfallen in a sherewe
Perseuereth lenger  than dooth dronkenesse
O glotonye  ful of cursednesse
O cause first of oure confusion
O original  of oure dampnacion
Til Crist hadde boght vs  with his blood agayn
Lo how deere  shortly for to sayn
Aboght was  thilke cursed vileynye  
Corupt was al this world for glotonye
Adam oure fader and his wyf also
ffro Paradys  to labour and to wo
Were dryuen for that vice  it is no drede
ffor whil þat Adam fasted  as I rede
He was in Paradys  and whan þat he
Eet of the frut defended on a tree
Anon he was out cast to wo and peyne
O glotonye  on thee wel oghte vs pleyne
 O wiste a man  how manye maladies
ffolwen of excesse  and of glotonyes
He wolde been  the moore mesurable
Of his diete  sittyng at his table
Allas the shorte throte  the tendre mouth
Maketh  þat Est and West and North and South
In erthe  in Eyr  in Water  men to swynke
To gete a gloton  deyntee mete and drynke
Of this matere  o Paul  wel kanstow trete
Mete vnto wombe  and wombe eek vnto mete
Shal god destroyen bothe  as Paulus seith
Allas a foul thyng is it by my feith
  
To seye this word  and fouler is the dede
Whan man so drynketh  of the white and rede
That of his throte  he maketh his pryuee
Thurgh  thilke cursed superfluite
 The Apostle wepyng seith ful pitously
Ther walken manye  of whiche yow toold haue I
I seye it now wepyng with pitous voys
Ther been enemys  of Cristes croys
Of whiche the ende is deth  wombe is hir god
O wombe  o bely  o stynkyng cod
ffulfilled of dong and of corrupcioun
At either ende of thee  foul is the soun
How greet labour  and cost is thee to fynde
Thise Cokes  how they stampe  and streyne  and grynde
And turnen substance  into accident
To fulfillen al  the likerous talent
Out of the harde bones  knokke they
The mary  for they caste nat awey
That may go thurgh the golet softe and soote  
Of Spicerie  of lief  and bark and roote
Shal been his Sauce  ymaked by delit
To make hym yet a newer appetit
But certes  he that haunteth swiche delices
Is deed  whil þat he lyueth in tho vices
 A lecherous thyng is wyn  and dronkenesse
Is ful of stryuyng and of wrecchednesse
O dronke man  disfigured is thy face
Sour is thy breeth  foul artow to embrace
And thurgh thy dronke nose  semeth the soun
As thogh thou seydest ay  Sampsoun Sampsoun
And yet god woot Sampson drank neuere no wyn
Thou fallest as it were a stiked swyn
Thy tonge is lost and al thyn honest cure
ffor dronkenesse  is verray sepulture
Of mannes wit and his discrecion
In whom þat drynke  hath domynacion
  
He kan no conseil kepe  it is no drede
Now kepe yow  fro the white and fro the rede
And namely  fro the white wyn of lepe
That is to selle  in ffisshstrete  or in Chepe
This wyn of Spaigne  crepeth subtilly
In othere wynes  growynge faste by
Of which  ther riseth swich fumositee
That whan a man  hath dronken draghtes thre
And weneth þat he be  at hom in Chepe
He is in Spaigne  right at the toune of lepe
Nat at the Rochel  ne at Burdeux toun
And thanne wol he seyn  Sampson Sampsoun
 But herkneth lordynges  o word I yow preye
That alle the souereyn actes  dar I seye
Of victories  in the olde testament
Thurgh verray god  that is omnipotent
Were doon in abstinence  and in prayere
Looketh the Bible  and ther ye may it leere
 Looke Attilla  the grete conquerour
Deyde in his sleepe  with shame and dishonour
Bledyng at his nose  in dronkenesse
A Capitayn  sholde lyue in sobrenesse
 And ouer al this  auyseth yow right wel  
What was comaunded  vnto Lamwel
Nat Samuel  but Lamwel seye I
Redeth the Bible  and fynd it expresly
Of wyn yeuynge  to hem þat han Iustise
Namoore of this  for it may wel suffise
 And now  that I haue spoken of glotonye
Now wol I  yow defende hasardrye
Hasard  is verray moder of lesynges
And of deceite  and cursed forswerynges
Blaspheme of Crist manslaughtre  and wast also
Of catel  and of tyme  and forthermo
It is reproue  and contrarie of honour
ffor to ben holden  a commune hasardour
  
And euere the hyer  he is of estaat
The moore is he holden desolat
If þat a Prynce  vseth hasardrye
In alle gouernance  and policye
He is  as by commune opynyon
Yholde  the lasse in reputacion
 Stilbon  that was a wys Embassadour
Was sent to Corynthe  in ful gret honour
ffro lacedomye  to make hire alliaunce
And whan he cam  hym happed par chaunce
That alle the gretteste  þat were of that lond
Pleiynge at the hasard  he hem fond
ffor which as soone  as it myghte be
He stal hym hom agayn  to his contree
And seyde  ther wol I nat lese my name
Ny wol nat take on me  so greet defame
Yow for to allie  vnto none hasardours
Sendeth  othere wise Embassadours
ffor by my trouthe  me were leuere dye
Than I yow sholde  to hasardours allye
ffor ye that been  so glorious in honours
Shal nat allye yow  with hasardours
As by my wyl  ne as by my tretee
This wise Philosophre  thus seyde he
 Looke eek  that to the kyng Demetrius
The kyng of Parthes  as the book seith vs
Sente hym a paire of dees  of gold in scorn  
ffor he hadde vsed  hasard ther biforn
ffor which  he heeld his glorie  or his renoun
At no value  or reputacioun
Lordes may fynden  oother manere pley
Honeste ynow  to dryue the day awey
 Now wol I speke  of oothes false and grete
A word or two  as olde bokes trete
 Greet sweryng is a thyng abhomynable
And fals sweryng is yet moore repreuable
  
The heighe god  forbad sweryng at al
Witnesse on Mathew  but in special
Of sweryng seith the holy Ieremye
Thow shalt swere sooth thyne othes  and nat lye
And swere in doom  and eek in rightwisnesse
But ydel sweryng is a cursednesse
 Bihoold and se  þat in the firste table
Of heighe goddes hestes honurable
How þat the seconde heste of hym  is this
Take nat my name  in ydel or amys
Lo rather he forbedeth · swich sweryng
Than homycide  or many a cursed thyng
I seye  þat as by ordre  thus it standeth
This knoweth  that hise hestes vnderstandeth
How that the seconde heste of god  is that
And forther ouer  I wol thee telle al plat
That vengeance  shal nat parten from his hous
That of hise othes  is to outrageous
By goddes precious herte  and by his nayles
And by the blood of Crist that is in hayles
Seuene is my chance  and thyn is cynk and treye
By goddes armes  if thow falsly pleye
This dagger  shal thurgh out thyn herte go
This frut cometh  of the bicche bones two
fforsweryng  Ire  falsnesse  homycide
Now for the loue of Crist that for vs dyde
Lete youre othes  bothe grete and smale
But sires  now wol I  telle forth my tale
 Thise Riotours thre  of which I telle
Longe erst er Pryme ronge of any belle
Were set hem  in a Tauerne to drynke  
And as they sat they herde a belle klynke
Biforn a cors  was caryed to his graue
That oon of hem  gan callen to his knaue
Go bet quod he  and axe redily
What cors is this  that passeth heer forby
  
And looke  þat thow reporte his name wel
 Sire quod this boy  it nedeth neuer a del
It was me told  er ye cam heer two houres
He was pardee  an old felawe of youres
And sodeynly  he was yslayn to nyght
ffordronke  as he sat on his bench vp right
Ther cam a priuee theef  men clepeth deeth
That in this contree  al the peple sleeth
And with his spere  he smoot his herte atwo
And wente his wey  withouten wordes mo
He hath  a thousand slayn this pestilence
And maister  er ye come in his presence
Me thynketh  that it were necessarie
ffor to be war  of swich an Aduersarie
Beeth redy  for to meete hym euere moore
Thus taughte me my dame  I sey namoore
 By Seinte Marie  seyde this Tauerner
The child seith sooth  for he hath slayn this yer
Henne ouer a myle  withInne a greet village
Bothe man and womman  child and hyne and page
I trowe  his habitacion be there
To been auysed  greet wisdom it were
Er that he dide  a man a dishonour
 Ye goddes armes  quod this Riotour
Is it swich peril  with hym for to meete
I shal hym seke  by wey  and eek by Strete
I make avow  to goddes digne bones
Herkneth felawes  we thre been al ones
Lat ech of vs  holde vp his hand to oother
And ech of vs  bicome ootheres brother
And we wol sleen  this false traytour deeth
He shal be slayn  he þat so manye sleeth
By goddes dignytee  er it be nyght
 Togidres han thise thre  hir trouthes plyght
To lyue and dyen  ech of hem with oother  
As thogh he were  his owene ybore brother
  
And vp they stirte  al dronken  in this rage
And forth they goon  towardes that village
Of which the Tauernner  hadde spoke biforn
And many a grisly ooth  thanne han they sworn
And Cristes blessed body  they torente
Deeth shal be deed  if they may hym hente
 Whan they han goon  nat fully a myle
Right as they wolde  han treden ouer a style
An old man and a poure  with hem mette
This olde man  ful mekely hem grette
And seyde thus  now lordes god yow se
 The proudeste  of thise Riotours thre
Answerde agayn  what carl with sory grace
Why artow al forwrapped  saue thy face
Why lyuestow so longe  in so greet age
 This olde man  gan looke in his visage
And seyde thus  for I ne kan nat fynde
A man  thogh þat I walked into Inde
Neither in Citee  ne in no village
That wolde chaunge  his youthe for myn age
And therfore moot I han  myn age stille
As longe tyme  as it is goddes wille
 Ne deeth allas  ne wol nat haue my lyf
Thus walke I  lyk a restelees caytyf
And on the ground  which is my modres gate
I knokke with my staf  bothe erly and late
And seye  leeue moder leet me In
Lo how I vanysshe  flessh and blood and skyn
Allas  whan shal my bones  been at reste
Moder  with yow  wolde I chaunge my cheste
That in my chambre  longe tyme hath be
Ye for an heyre clowt to wrappe me
But yet to me  she wol nat do that grace
ffor which ful pale  and welked is my face
But sires  to yow  it is no curteisye
To speken  to an old man vileynye
  
But he trespase in word  or ellis in dede
In holy writ ye may your self wel rede
 Agayns an old man  hoor vpon his heed
Ye shal arise  wherfore I yeue yow reed
Ne dooth vnto an old man  noon harm now
Namoore than þat ye wolde  men dide to yow
In age  if þat ye so longe abyde
And god be with yow  wher ye go or ryde
I moot go thider  as I haue to go
 Nay olde cherl  by god thow shalt nat so
Seyde  this oother hasardour anon
Thow partest nat so lightly  by Seint Iohn
Thow speeke right now  of thilke traytour deeth
That in this contree  alle oure freendes sleeth
Haue here my trouthe  as thow art his espye
Tel wher he is  or thow shalt it abye
By god  and by the holy sacrament
ffor soothly  thow art oon of his assent
To sleen vs yonge folk thow false theef
 Now sires quod he  if þat yow be so leef
To fynde deeth  turn vp this croked wey
ffor in that groue  I lafte hym by my fey
Vnder a tree  and ther he wol abyde
Nat for youre boost he wol hym no thyng hyde
Se ye that ook right ther ye schal hym fynde
God saue yow  that boghte agayn mankynde
And yow amende  thus seyde this olde man
 And euerich  of thise Riotours ran
Til he cam to that tree  and ther they founde
Of floryns fyne  of gold  ycoyned rounde
Wel ny an viij busshels  as hem thoughte
No lenger thanne  after deeth they soughte
But ech of hem  so glad was of the sighte
ffor þat the floryns  been so faire and brighte
That doun they sette hem  by this precious hoord
The worste of hem  he spak the firste word
  
 Bretheren quod he  taak kepe  what þat I seye
My wit is greet thogh þat I bourde and pleye
This tresor hath ffortune  vnto vs ȝeuen
In myrthe and iolitee  oure lyf to lyuen
And lightly as it cometh  so wol we spende
Ey goddes precious dignytee  who wende
To day  that we sholde han  so fair a grace  
But myghte this gold  be caried fro this place
Hoom to myn hous  or ellis vnto youres
ffor wel ye woot that al this gold is oures
Thanne were we  in heigh felicitee
But trewely  by daye it may nat be
Men wolde seyn  þat we were theues stronge
And for oure owene tresor  doon vs honge
This tresor  moste ycaried be by nyghte
As wisly  and as sleyly  as it myghte
Therfore I rede  that cut amonges vs alle
Be drawe  and lat se  wher the cut wol falle
And he þat hath the cut with herte blithe
Shal renne to towne  and that ful swithe
And brynge vs  breed  and wyn  ful priuely
And two of vs  shal kepen subtilly
This tresor wel  and if he wol nat tarye
Whan it is nyght we wol this tresor carye
By oon assent wher as vs thynketh best
That oon of hem  the cut broghte in his fest
And bad hem drawe  and looke wher it wol falle
And it fel  on the yongeste of hem alle
And forth toward the town  he wente anon
And also soone  as þat he was agon
That oon of hem  spak thus vnto that oother
Thow knowest wel  thow art my sworn brother
Thy profit wol I telle thee anon
Thow woost wel  þat oure felawe is agon
And heere is gold  and that ful greet plentee
That shal departed been  among vs thre
  
But nathelees  if I kan shape it so
That it departed were  among vs two
Hadde I nat doon  a freendes torn to thee
 That oother answerde  I noot how that may be
He woot þat the gold  is with vs tweye
What shal we doon  what shal we to hym seye
 Shal it be conseil  seyde the firste shrewe
And I shal telle  in a wordes fewe
What we shul doon  and brynge it wel aboute
 I graunte quod that oother  out of doute
That by my trouthe  I wol thee nat biwreye  
 Now quod the firste  thow woost wel we be tweye
And two of vs  shul strenger be than oon
Looke whan þat he is set that right anon
Arys  as though thow woldest with hym pleye
And I shal ryue hym  thurgh the sydes tweye
Whil that thow strogelest with hym  as in game
And with thy daggere  looke thow do the same
And thanne shal  al this gold departed be
My deere freend  bitwixe thee and me
Thanne may we bothe  oure lustes al fulfille
And pleye at dees  right at oure owene wille
And thus acorded been  thise sherewes tweye
To sleen the thridde  as ye han herd me seye
 This yongeste  which that wente to the toun
fful ofte in herte  he rolleth vp and doun
The beautee of thise floryns  newe and brighte
O lord quod he  if so were þat I myghte
Haue al this tresor  to my self allone
Ther is no man  þat lyueth vnder the trone
Of god  that sholde lyue  so myrie as I
And at the laste  the feend oure enemy
Putte in his thoght þat he sholde poyson beye
With which he myghte sleen  his felawes tweye
ffor why  the feend foond hym  in swich lyuynge
That he hadde leue  hym to sorwe brynge
  
ffor this was outrely  his ful entente
To sleen hem bothe  and neuere to repente
 And forth he goth  no lenger wolde he tarye
In to the toun  vnto Apothecarye
And preyed hym  þat he hym wolde selle
Som poyson  that he myghte his rattes quelle
And eek ther was  a polcat in his hawe
That as he seyde  his capons hadde yslawe
And fayn he wolde  wreke hym if he myghte
On vermyn  that destroyed hym by nyghte
 The Pothecarie answerde  and thow shalt haue
A thyng that also god  my soule saue
In al this world  ther is no creature
That ete  or dronke  hath of this confiture
Nat but the montance  of a corn of whete  
That he ne shal his lyf  anoon forlete
Ye sterue he shal  and that in lasse while
Than thow wolt goon a pass  nat but a myle
The poyson  is so strong and violent
This cursed man  hath in his hand yhent
This poyson in a box  and sith he ran
Into the nexte Strete  vnto a man
And borwed hym  large Botels thre
And in the two  his poison poured he
The thridde  he kepte clene for his drynke
ffor al the nyght he shoope hym for to swynke
In cariyng of the gold  out of that place
And whan this Riotour  with sory grace
Hadde filled with wyn  hise grete Botels thre
To hise felawes  agayn repaireth he
 What nedeth it to sarmone of it moore
ffor right as they  hadde cast his deeth bifore
Right so  they han hym slayn  and that anon
And whan this was doon  thus spak that oon
Now lat vs sitte and drynke  and make vs merye
And afterward  we wol his body berye
  
And with that word  it happed hym par cas
To take the Botel  ther the poyson was
And drank and yaf his felawe drynke also
ffor which anon  they storuen bothe two
 But certes I suppose  that Auycen
Wroot neuere in no Canon  ne in no fen
Mo wonder signes  of empoysonyng
Than hadde thise wrecches two  er hir endyng
Thus ended been  thise homicides two
And eek the false empoysonere also
 O · cursed synne  of alle cursednesse
O · traytours homicide  o wikkednesse
O · glotonye  luxure  and hasardrye
Thou blasphemour of Crist with vileynye
And othes grete  of vsage  and of pryde
Allas mankynde  how may it bityde
That to thy Creatour  which þat thee wroghte
And with his precious herte blood  the boghte
Thow art so fals  and so vnkynde allas  
 Now goode men  god foryeue yow youre trespas
And ware yow  fro the synne of Auarice
Myn holy pardon  may yow alle warisse
So that ye offre nobles  or starlynges
Or ellis siluer broches  spones  rynges
Boweth youre heed  vnder this holy bulle
Cometh vp ye wyues  offreth of youre wolle
Youre name I entre  here in my rolle anon
Into the blisse of heuene  shul ye gon
I yow assoile  by myn heigh power
Ye þat wol offre  as clene and eek as cler
As ye were born  and lo sires thus I preche
And Ihesu crist that is oure soules leche
So graunte yow  his pardon to receyue
ffor that is best I wol yow nat deceyue
 But sires  o word  forgat I in my tale
I haue Relikes and pardon in my male
  
As faire  as any man in Engelond
Whiche were me yeuen  by the Popes hond
If any of yow  wol of deuocion
Offren  and han myn absolucion
Com forth anon  and kneleth here adoun
And mekely  receyueth my pardoun
Or ellis  taketh pardon as ye wende
Al newe and fressh  at euery myles ende
So þat ye offren alwey  newe and newe
Nobles  or pens  whiche þat been good and trewe
It is an honour  to euerich that is heer
That ye mowe haue  a suffisant pardoner
Tassoile yow  in contree as ye ryde
ffor auentures  whiche þat may bityde
Parauenture  ther may falle oon or two
Doun of his hors  and breke his nekke atwo
Looke swich a seuretee is it to yow alle
That I am  in youre felaweship yfalle
That may assoille yow  bothe moore and lasse
Whan þat the soule  shal fro the body passe
I rede  that oure hoost shal bigynne
ffor he is moost envoluped in synne
Com forth sire hoost  and offre first anon  
And thow shalt kisse  the Relikes euerychon
Ye for a grote  vnbokele anon thy purs
 Nay nay quod he  thanne haue I Cristes curs
Lat be quod he  it shal nat be so thee ich
Thow woldest make me kisse thyn olde breech
And swere it were  a Relyk of a Seint
Thogh it were  with thy fondement depeynt
But by the croys  which þat Seint Eleyne foond
I wold I hadde  thy coylons in myn hond
In stide of Relikes  or of Seintuarie
Lat cutte hem of  I wol thee hem carie
They shul be shryned  in an hogges toord
 This pardoner  answerde nat a word
  
So wrooth he was  no word ne wolde he seye
 Now quod oure hoost I wol no lenger pleye
With thee  ne with noon oother angry man
 But right anon  the worthy knyght bigan
Whan þat he saugh  þat al the peple lough
Namoore of this  for it is right ynough
Sire Pardoner be glad  and murye of cheere
And sire hoost that been to me so deere
I pray yow  þat ye kisse the Pardoner
And Pardoner  I pray thee  drawe thee neer
And as we diden  lat vs lawe and pleye
Anon they kiste  and ryden forþ hir weye  
A Marchant whilom  dwelled at Seint Denys
That riche was  for which men helde hym wys
Awyf he hadde  of excellent beautee
And compaignable  and reuelous was she
Which is a thyng that causeth moore dispence
Than worth  is al the cheere and reuerence
That men hem doon  at festes and at daunces
Swich salutacions  and contenances
Passen  as dooth a shadwe vp on the wal
But wo is hym  that payen moot for al
The sely housbonde  algate he moot paye
He moot vs clothe  and he moot vs arraye
Al for his owene worshipe  richely
In which array  we dauncen iolily
And if that he noght may  parauenture
Or ellis  list no swich dispense endure
But thynketh  it is wasted and ylost
Thanne moot another  payen for oure cost
Or lene vs gold  and that is perilous
This noble Marchant heeld a worthy hous
ffor which  he hadde alday  so greet repair
ffor his largesse  and for his wyf was fair
What wonder is  but herkneth to my tale
Amonges alle hise gestes  grete and smale
 Ther was a Monk a fair man and a bold
I trowe  a thritty wynter  he was old
That euere in oon  was drawyng to that place
This yonge Monk that was so fair of face
  
Aqueynted was so  with the goode man
Sith that hir firste knewliche bigan
That in his hous  as famulier was he
As it is possible  any freend to be
And for as muchel  as this goode man
And eek this Monk of which þat I bigan
Were bothe two yborn  in o village
The Monk hym claymeth  as for cosynage
And he agayn  he seith nat ones nay  
But was as glad ther of  as fowel of day
ffor to his herte  it was a gret plesance
Thus been they knyt with eterne alliance
And ech of hem  gan oother  for tassure
Of bretherhede  whil þat hir lyf may dure
 ffree was daun Iohn  and manly of dispence
As in that hous  and ful of diligence
To doon plesance  and also greet costage
He nat forgat to yeue the leeste page
In al that hous  but after hir degree
He yaf the lord  and sith al his meynee
Whan þat he cam  som manere honeste thyng
ffor which  they were as glad of his comyng
As fowel is fayn  whan þat the sonne vp riseth
Namoore of this as now  for it suffiseth
 But so bifel  this Marchant on a day
Shoope hym  to make redy his array
Toward the town of Brugges  for to fare
To byen there  a porcion of ware
ffor which he hath  to Parys sent anon
A messager  and preyed hath daun Iohn
That he sholde come  to Seint Denys and pleye
With hym  and with his wyf a day or tweye
Er he to Brugges wente  in alle wise
 This noble Monk of which I yow deuyse
Hath of his Abbot as hym list licence
By cause he was a man  of heigh prudence
  
And eek an Officer  out for to ryde
To seen hir granges  and hir bernes wyde
And vn to Seint denys  he comth anon
Who was so welcome  as my lord daun Iohn
Oure deere cosyn  ful of curteisye
With hym broghte he  a Iubbe of Maluesye
And eek another  ful of fyn vernage
And volatil  as ay was his vsage
And thus I lete hem  ete and drynke and pleye
This Marchant and this Monk  a day or tweye
 The thridde day  this Marchant vp ariseth
And on his nedes  sadly hym auyseth
And vp  in to his Countour hous goth he  
To rekene with hym self  wel may be
Of thilke yeer  how þat it with hym stood
And how þat he  despended hadde his good
And if that he  encressed were or noon
Hise bokes  and his bagges  many oon
He leyth biforn hym  on his Countyng bord
fful riche was his tresor  and his hord
ffor which ful faste  his Countour dore he shette
And eek he nolde  þat no man sholde hym lette
Of his acountes  for the mene tyme
And thus he sit  til it was passed prime
 Daun Iohn was risen  in the morwe also
And in the gardyns  walketh to and fro
And hath his thynges seyd  ful curteisly
 This goode wyf  cam walkyng priuely
In to the gardyn  ther he walketh softe
And hym salueth  as she hath doon ofte
A mayde child  cam in hir compaignye
Which as hir list she may gouerne and gye
ffor yet vnder the yerde was the mayde
 O deere cosyn myn  daun Iohn she sayde
What eyleth yow  so rathe for to ryse
 Nece quod he  it oghte ynow suffise
  
ffyue houres  for to slepe  vp on a nyght
But it were  for an old apalled wight
As been thise wedded men  þat lye and dare
As in a forme  sit a wery hare
Were al forstraught with houndes grete and smale
But deere Nece  why be ye so pale
I trowe certes  that oure goode man
Hath yow laboured  sith the nyght bigan
That yow were nede  to resten hastily
And with that word  he lough ful myrily
And of his owene thoght he weex al reed
 This faire wyf  gan for to shake hir heed
And seyde thus  ye god woot al quod she
Nay cosyn myn  it stant nat so with me
ffor by that god  that yaf me soule and lyf
In al the Reawme of ffrance  is ther no wyf
That lasse lust hath  to that sory pley  
ffor I may synge  allas and weilawey
That I was born  but to no wight quod she
Dar I nat telle  how þat it stant with me
Wher fore I thynke  out of this land to wende
Or ellis  of my self  to make an ende
So ful am I  of drede  and eek of care
 This Monk bigan  vp on this wyf to stare
And seyde  allas  my Nece god forbede
That ye  for any sorwe  or any drede
ffordo your self  but telleth me youre grief
Parauenture  I may in youre meschief
Conseille  or helpe  and therfore telleth me
Al youre anoy  for it shal been secree
ffor on my Porthors  I make an oth
That neuere in my lif  for lief  or loth
Ne shal I  of no conseil  yow biwreye
 The same agayn to yow  quod she I seye
By god  and by this Porthors  I swere
Thogh men me wolde  al in to peces tere
  
Ne shal I neuere  for to gon to helle
Biwreye a word  of thyng þat ye me telle
Nat for no cosynage  ne alliance
But verraily  for loue and affiance
Thus been they sworn  and her vp on they keste
And ech of hem  tolde oother what hem leste
 Cosyn quod she  if þat I hadde a space
As I haue noon  and namely in this place
Thanne wolde I telle  a legende of my lyf
What I haue suffred  sith I was a wyf
With myn housbonde  al be he youre cosyn
 Nay quod this Monk by god and Seint Martin
He is namore  cosyn vn to me
Than is this leef þat hangeth on the tree

To han  the moore cause of aqueyntance
Of yow  which I haue loued specially
Abouen alle wommen  sikerly
This swere I yow  on my profession
Telleth youre grief  lest þat he come adoun
And hasteth yow  and goth awey anon  
 My deere loue quod she  o my daun Iohn

But out it moot I may namoore abyde
 Myn housbonde is to me  the worste man
That euere was  sith þat the world bigan
But sith I am a wyf  it sit nat me
To tellen no wight of oure priuetee
Neither abedde  ne in noon oother place
God shilde  I sholde it tellen for his grace
A wyf ne shal nat seyn  of hir housbonde
But al honour  as I kan vnderstonde
Saue vn to yow  thus muche I tellen shal
As help me god  he is noght worth at al
In no degree  the value of a flye
But yet me greueth moost his nygardye
  
And wel ye woo þat wommen naturelly
Desiren thynges vj as wel as I
They wolde  þat hir housbondes sholde be
 Hardy and wise  and riche  and therto free
And buxom vn to his wyf  and fressh abedde
But by that ilke lord  that for vs bledde
ffor his honour  my self for to arraye
A sonday next I moot nedes paye
An hundred frankes  or ellis am I lorn
Yet were me leuere  þat I were vnborn
Than me were doon  a sclaundre  or vileynye
And if myn housbonde eek myghte it espye

Lene me this somme  or ellis moot I deye
Daun Iohn I seye  lene me thise hundred frankes
Pardee I wil noght faile yow my thankes
If þat yow list to doon  that I yow praye
ffor at a certeyn day  I wol yow paye
And doon to yow  what plesance and seruyse
That I may doon  right as yow list deuyse
And but I do  god take on me vengeance
As foul  as euere hadde Genelon of ffrance
 This gentil Monk answerde in this manere
Now trewely  myn owene lady deere
I haue quod he  on yow so gret a routhe
That I yow swere  and plighte yow my trouthe
That whan youre housbonde  is to fflandres fare

And with that word  he caughte hire by the flankes
And hire embraceth harde  and kiste hire ofte
Goth now youre wey quod he  al stille and softe
And lat vs dyne  as soone  as þat ye may

Vp to hir housbonde  is his wyf ygon
And knokketh at his Countour  boldely

How longe tyme  wol ye rekene and caste

And by that lord  that clepid is Seint Yue
Scarsly amonges xij x shul thryue
Continuelly  lastyng vn to oure age
We may wel make cheere  and good visage
And dryue forth the world  as it may be
And kepen oure estat in pryuetee
Til we be dede  or ellis that we pleye
A pilgrymage  or goon out of the weye
And ther fore  haue I gret necessitee
Vp on this queynte world  tauyse me
ffor euere mo  we mote stonde in drede
Of hap and ffortune  in oure chapmanhede
 To fflandres wol I go  tomorwe at day  
And come agayn  as soone as euere I may

As be to euery wight buxom and meke
And for to kepe oure good  be curious
And honestly  gouerne wel oure hous

Of siluer in thy purs  shaltow nat faille
And with that word  his Countour dore he shette
And doun he goth  no lenger wolde he lette
But hastily  a masse was ther seyd
And spedily  the tables were yleyd
And to the dyner  faste they hem spedde
And richely this Monk the chapman fedd
 At after dyner  daun Iohn sobrely
This chapman took a part and priuely
He seyde hym thus  cosyn it standeth so
That wel I se  to Brugges wol ye go

Gouerneth yow also  of youre diete

If it lye in my power  and my myght

 O thing er þat ye goon  if it may be

An hundred frankes  for a wyke or tweye

To store with a place  that is oures

Nat for a thousand frankes  a myle way
But lat this thyng be secree  I yow preye

And fare now wel  myn owene cosyn deere

 This noble Marchant gentilly anon
Answerde and seyde  o cosyn myn daun Iohn
Now sikerly  this is a smal requeste
My gold is youres  whan þat it yow leste
And nat oonly my gold  but my chaffare
Tak what yow list god shilde þat ye spare
But o thyng is  ye knowe it wel ynow
Of Chapmen  that hir moneye is hir plow
We may creance  whil we han a name
But goldlees for to been  it is no game
Pay it agayn  whan it lyth in youre ese
After my myght ful fayn wol I yow plese
 Thise hundred frankes  he fette forth anon
And priuely  he took hem to daun Iohn
No wight in al this world  wiste of this lone
Sauyng this Marchant and daun Iohn allone
They drynke  and speke  and rome a while and pleye
Til that daun Iohn  rideth to his Abbeye
 The morwe cam  and forth this Marchant rydeth
To fflandres ward  his Prentys wel hym gydeth
Til he cam  in to Brugges murily
Now goth this Marchant faste and bisily
Aboute his nede  and byeth and creanceth
He neither  pleyeth at the dees  ne daunceth
But as a Marchant shortly for to telle
He let his lyf  and ther I lete hym dwelle
 The sonday next  the Marchant was agon
To Seint denys  ycomen is daun Iohn
With crowne and berd  al fressh and newe shaue
In al the hous  ther nas so litel a knaue
Ne no wight ellis  þat he nas ful fayn
That my lord daun Iohn  was come agayn
And shortly  to the poynt right for to gon
This faire wyf accorded with daun Iohn
That for thise hundred frankes  he sholde al nyght
Haue hire in his armes  bolt vpright
  
And this acord  parfourned was in dede
In myrthe al nyght a bisy lyf they lede
Til it was day  that daun Iohn wente his way  
And bad the meynee  fare wel haue good day
ffor noon of hem  ne no wight in the town
Hath of daun Iohn  right no suspecioun
And forth he rydeth hom  til his Abbeye
Or where hym list namoore of hym I seye
 This Marchant whan þat ended was the faire
To Seint Denys  he gan for to repaire
And with his wyf  he maketh feste and cheere
And telleth hire  that chaffare is so deere
That nedes  moste he make a cheuyssance
ffor he was bounden  in a reconyssance
To paye  twenty thousand sheelde anon
ffor which  this Marchant is to Parys gon
To borwe  of certeyne freendes  that he hadde
A certeyn frankes  and somme with hym he ladde
And whan þat he was come  in to the town
ffor greet chiertee  and greet affeccioun
Vn to daun Iohn  he first goth  hym to pleye
Nat for to axe  or borwe of hym moneye
But for to wite  and seen of his welfare
And for to tellen hym  of his chaffare
As freendes doon  whan they been met yfeere
Daun Iohn  hym maketh feste  and murye cheere
And he hym tolde agayn  ful specially
How he hadde  wel yboght and graciously
Thanked be god  al hool his marchandise
Saue þat he moste  in alle maner wyse
Maken a cheuyssance  as for his beste
And thanne he sholde been  in ioye and reste
 Daun Iohn answerde  certes I am fayn
That ye in heele  ar comen hom agayn
And if þat I were riche  as haue I blisse
Of twenty thousand sheeld  sholde ye nat mysse
  
ffor ye so kyndely  this oother day
Lente me gold  and as I kan and may

But nathelees  I took vn to oure dame
Yowre wyf at hom  the same gold agayn
Vp on youre bench  she woot it wel certayn
By certeyn toknes  that I kan yow telle  
Now by youre leue  I may no lenger dwelle
Oure Abbot wol out of this town anon
And in his compaignye  moot I gon
Greet wel oure dame  myn owene Nece swete
And fare wel deere cosyn  til we meete
 This Marchant which þat was ful war and wys
Creanced hath  and payed eek in Parys
To certeyn lombardes  redy in hir hond
The somme of gold  and gat of hem his bond
And hoom he gooth  murye as a Papyniay
ffor wel he knew  he stood in swich array
That nedes moste he wynne  in that viage
A thousand frankes  abouen al his costage
 His wyf ful redy  mette hym at the gate
As she was wont of old vsage algate
And al that nyght in myrthe they bisette
ffor he was riche  and cleerly out of dette
 Whan it was day  this Marchant gan embrace
His wyf al newe  and kiste hire on hir face
And vp he goth  and maketh it ful tough
Namoore quod she  by god ye haue ynough
And wantownely agayn  with hym she pleyde
Til at the laste  this Marchant seyde
 By god quod he  I am a litel wroth
With yow my wyf  al thogh it be me looth
And woot ye why  by god as þat I gesse
That ye han maad  a manere strangenesse
Bitwixen me  and my cosyn daun Iohn
Ye sholde han warned me  er I had gon
  
That he yow hadde  a hundred frankes payed
By redy tokne  and heeld hym yuele apayed
ffor that I to hym  spak of cheuyssance
Me semed so  as by his contenance
But nathelees  by god oure heuene kyng

Tel me alwey  er that I fro thee go
If any dettour  hath in myn absence
Ypayed thee  lest thurgh thy necligence
I myghte hym axe  a thyng þat he hath payed  
 This wyf  was nat afered ne afrayed
But boldely she seyde  and that anon
Marie I diffye  the false Monk daun Iohn

That he hadde yeue it me  by cause of yow
To doon ther with  myn honour and my prow

That he hath had  ful ofte tymes heere
 But sith I se  it stant in this disioynt

Turn hiderward  and maketh bettre cheere
 This Marchant saugh  ther was no remedye
And for to chide  it nere but folye

But by thy lyf  ne be namoore so large
Keepe bet thy good  this yeue I thee in charge
Thus endeth my tale  and god vs sende

Another tale  and with that word he sayde

But by the mouth of children  thy bountee
Parfourned is  for on the brest soukynge
Som tyme  shewen they thyn heryynge
 Wher fore in laude  as I best kan or may
Of thee  and of the white lilye flour

To telle a storie  I wol do my labour
Nat that I may  encressen hir honour
ffor she hir self  is honour  and the Roote
Of bountee next hir sone  and soules boote
 O moder mayde  o mayde moder free  
O bussh vnbrent brennyng in Moyses sighte

Thurgh thyn humblesse  the goost þat in thalighte
Of whos vertu  whan he thyn herte lighte

Thow goost biforn  of thy benygnytee
And getest vs  the light of thy prayere
To gyden vs  vn to thy sone so deere

ffor to declare  thy grete worthynesse
That I ne may  the weighte nat sustene
But as a child  of twelue month old or lesse
That kan vnnethe  any word expresse
Right so fare I  and ther fore I yow preye
Gideth my song that I shal of yow seye
Ther was in Asye  in a greet Citee
Amonges cristen folk a Iewerye
Sustened  by a lord  of that contree
ffor foul vsure  and lucre of vileynye
Hateful  to Crist and to his compaignye
And thurgh the strete  men mte ryde and wende
ffor it was free  and o
 A litel scole  of cristen folk ther stood  
Doun at the ferther ende  in which ther weere
Children an heepe  ycomen of cristen blood
That lerned in that scole  yeer by yere
Swich manere doctrine  as men vsed there
This is to seyn  to syngen and to rede
As smale children doon  in hir childhede
 Among thise children  was a wydwes sone
A litel clergeon  vij yeer of age
That day by day  to scole was his wone
And eek also  wher as he say thymage
Of Cristes moder  hadde he in vsage
As hym was taught to knele adoun and seye
His Aue Marie  as he goth by the weye
  
 Thus hath this wydwe  hir litel sone ytaught
Oure blisful lady  Cristes moder deere
To worshipe ay  and he forgat it naught
ffor sely child  wol alwey soone lere
But ay  whan I remembre  of this matere
Seint Nicholas  stant euere in my presence
ffor he so yong to Crist dide reuerence
 This litel child  his litel book lernynge
As he sat in the scole  at his prymer
He Alma redemptoris  herde synge
As children  lerned hir Antiphoner
And as he dorste  he drow hym ner and ner
And herkned ay  the wordes and the note
Til he the firste vers  koude al by rote
Nat wiste he  what this latyn was to seye
ffor he so yong and tendre was of age
But on a day  his felawe gan he preye
Texpounden hym this song in his langage
Or telle hym why  this song was in vsage
This prayde he hym  struen and declare
re
 His felawe  which þat elder was than he  
Answerde hym thus  this song I haue herd seye
Was maked  of oure blisful lady free
Hir to salue  and eek hire for to preye
To been oure helpe  and socour  whan we deye
I kan namoore  expounde in this matere
I lerne song I kan but smal gramere
 And is this song maked in reuerence
Of Cristes moder  seyde this Innocent
Now certes  I wol do my diligence
To konne it al  er Cristemasse is went
  
Thogh þat I  for my Prymer shal be shent
And shal be beten  thries in an houre
I wol it konne  oure lady for to honoure
 His felawe taughte hym  homward priuely
ffro day to day  til he koude it by rote
And thanne he soong it  wel and boldely
ffro word to word  acordyng with the note
Twyes a day  it passed thurgh his throte
To scoleward  and homward  whan he wente
On Cristes moder  set was his entente
As I haue seyd  thurgh out the Iuerye
This litel child  as he cam to and fro
fful murily  wolde he synge and crye
O Alma redemptoris  euere mo
The swetnesse  his herte perced so
Of Cristes moder  that to hir to preye
He kan nat stynte  of syngyng by the weye
 Oure firste foo  the Serpent Sathanas
That hath in Iewes herte  his waspes nest
Vp swal and seyde  o Hebrayk peple allas
Is this to yow  a thyng that is honest
That swich a boy  shal walken As hym lest
In youre despit and synge of h sentence
Which is agayns  oure l
 ffro thennes forth  the Iewes han conspired  
This Innocent out of this world to chace
An homycide  therto han they hired
That in an Aleye  at a priuee place
And as the child  gan for by for to pace
This cursed Iew  hym hente  and heeld hym faste
And kitte his throte  and in a pit hym caste
  
 I seye  that in a wordrobe  they hym threwe
Wher as thise Iewes  purgen hir entraille
O cursed folk of herodes  al newe
What may  youre yuel entente yow auaille
Mordre wol out  certeyn it wol nat faille
And namely  ther as thonour of god shal sprede
The blood out cryeth  on youre cursed dede
 O martir sonded to virginitee
Now maystow syngen  folwyng euere in oon

Of which  the grete Euaungelist Seint Iohn
In Pathmos wroot which seith þat they þat gon
Biforn this lamb  and synge a song al newe
That neuere fflesshly  womman they ne knewe
 This poure wydwe  awaiteth al that nyght
After hir litel child  but he cam noght
ffor which as soone  as it was dayes lyght
With face pale  of drede and bisy thoght
She hath at scole  and ellis where hym soght
Til fynally  she gan so fer espie
That he last seyn was  in the Iewerie
 With modres pitee  in hir brest enclosed
She goth  as she were half out of hir mynde
To euery place  wheras she hath supposed
By liklyhede  hir litel child to fynde
And euere  on Cristes moder  meke and kynde
She cryde  and at the laste  she wroghte
ghte
She frayneth  and she prayeth pitously  
To euery Iew  that dwelte in thilke place
To telle hire  if hir child  wente oght forby
They seyde nay  but Ihesu of his grace
  
Yaf in hir thought in with a litel space
That in that place  after hir sone she cryde
Wher he was casten  in a pit bisyde
 O grete god  that parfournest thy laude
By mouth of Innocentz  lo here thy myght
This gemme of chastitee  this Emeraude
And eek of martirdom  the Ruby bright
Ther he with throte ycoruen  lay vpright
He Alma redemptoris  gan to synge
So loude  that al the place gan to rynge
 The cristen folk that thurgh the strete wente
In coomen  for to wondre vp on this thyng
And hastily  they for the Prouost sente
He cam anon  with outen tariyng
And herieth Crist that is of heuene kyng
And eek his moder  honour of mankynde
And after that the Iewes leet he bynde
 This child  with pitous lamentacion
Vp taken was  syngynge his song alway
And with honour  of greet procession
They carien hym  vn to the nexte Abbay
His moder swownyng by his beere lay
Vnnethe myghte  the peple that was there
This newe Rachel  bryngen fro his beere
 With torment and with shameful deth echon
This Prouost dooth thise Iewes for to sterue
That of this mordre wiste  and that anon
He nolde  no swich cursednesse obserue
Yuel shal haue  that yuel wol disserue
Ther fore with wilde hors de hem drawe
And after that he 
  
 Vp on his beere  ay lyth this Innocent  
Biforn the chief Auter  whil the masse laste
And after that the Abbot with his Couent
Han sped hem  for to buryen hym ful faste




And whan they  holy water on hym caste
Yet spak this child  whan spreynd was holy water
And song O alma redemptoris mater
 This Abbot which þat was an holy man
As monkes ben  or ellis oghten be
This yonge child  to coniure he bigan
And seyde  o deere child I halsen thee
In vertu  of the holy Trinitee
Tel me  what is thy cause for to synge
Sith þat thy throte is kit to my semynge
 My throte is kit vn to my nekke boon
Seyde this child  and as by wey of kynde
I sholde haue dyed  ye longe tyme agoon
But Ihesu crist as ye in bokes fynde
Wol þat his glorie laste  and be in mynde
And for the worshipe  of his moder deere
Yet may I synge  O alma  loude and clere
 This welle of mercy  Cristes moder swete
I loued alwey  as after my konnynge
And whan þat I my lyf sholde forlete
To me she cam  and bad me for to synge
This Antheme  verraily in my deiynge
As ye han herd  and whan þat I had songe
Me thoughte  she leyde a greyn vp on my tonge
 Wherfore I synge  and synge moot certeyn
In honour  of that blisful mayden free
Til fro my tonge  of taken is the greyn
And after that thus seyde she to me
  
My litel child  now wil I fecche thee
Whan þat the greyn is fhy tonge ytake
Be nat ag
 This holy monk this Abbot hym mene I  
His tonge out caughte  and took awey the greyn
And he  yaf vp the goost ful softely
And whan this Abbot hadde this wonder seyn
Hise salte teerys  trikled doun as reyn
And gruf he fil  al flat vp on the grounde
And stille he lay  as he had leyn ybounde
 The Couent eek lay on the pauement
Wepynge  and heryen cristes moder deere
And after that they ryse  and forth been went
And toke awey this martir  from his beere
And in a toumbe  of Marbilstones cleere
Enclosen they  this litel body swete
Ther he is now  god leue vs for to meete
 O yonge Hugh of Lyncoln  slayn also
With cursed Iewes  as it is notable
ffor it is  but a litel while ygo
Preye eek for vs  we synful folk vnstable
That of his mercy  god so merciable
On vs  his grete mercy multiplie
ffor reuerence  of his moder Marie Amen  
WHan seyd was al this myracle  euery man
As sobre was  that wonder was to se
Til that oure hoost iapen he bigan
And thanne at erst he looked vp on me
And seyde thus  what man artow quod he
Thow lookest as thow woldest fynde an hare
ffor euere vp on the ground  I se thee stare
 Approche neer  and looke vp myrily  
Now war yow sires  and lat this man haue place
He in the wast is shape as wel as I
This were a popet in an arm tenbrace
ffor any womman  smal and fair of face
He semeth eluyssh  by his contenance
ffor vn to no wight dooth he no daliance
 Sey now som what syn oother folk han sayd
Telle vs a tale  of myrthe  and that anon
Hoost quod I  ne beth nat yuele ypayd
ffor oother tale  certes kan I noon
But of a rym  I lerned longe agoon
Ye that is good quod he  now shul we heere
Som deyntee thyng me thynketh by his cheere

Listeth lordes  in good entent
And I wil telle verrayment
Of myrthe  and of solas
Al of a knyght was fair and gent
In bataille  and in tornament
His name  was sir Thopas
 Yborn he was  in fer contree
In fflaundres  al biyonde the see
At Poperyng in the place
His fader was  a man ful free
And lord he was  of that contree
As it was  goddes grace
 Sir Thopas wax  a doghty swayn
Whit was his face  as Payndemayn
His lippes reed as Rose
His rode is lyk  scarlet in grayn
As I yow telle  in good certayn
He hadde a semely nose
 His heer  his berd  was lyk Safrown
That to his girdel  raughte adown
Hise shoon  of Cordewane
Of Brugges  were his hosen brown
His Robe was  of syklatown
That coste many a Iane
  
 He koude hunte  at wilde deer
And ride an hawkyng for Ryuer
With grey goshauk on honde
Therto he was  a good Archier
Of wrastlyng was ther noon his pier
Ther any Ram shal stonde
 fful many mayde  bright in bour  
They moorne for hym  par amour
Whan hem were bet to slep
But he was chaast and no lechour
And sweete  as is the brambel flour
That bereth the rede hepe
 And so it fel  vp on a day
ffor sothe  as I yow telle may
Sir Thopas  wolde out ryde
He warth vp on  his Steede gray
And in his hand  a launcegay
A long swerd  by his syde
 He priketh thurgh  a fair fforest
Ther Inne  is many a wilde best
Ye bothe  bukke and hare
And as he priketh  North and Est
I telle it yow  hym hadde almest
bitydde  a sory care
 There spryngen herbes  grene and smale
The licorys  and Cetewale
And many a clowe Gylofre
And notemuge  to putte in Ale
Wheither it be moyste or stale
Or  for to leye in cofre
  
 The bryddes synge  it is no nay
The Sperhauk and the Popyniay
That ioye  it was to here
The Thurstelock  made eek his lay
The wodedowue  vp on the spray
She sang ful loude and clere
 Sire Thopas fil  in loue longynge
Al whan he herde  the thrustel synge
And pryked  as he were wood
His fayre Steede  in his prikynge
So swatte  þat men myghte hym wrynge
His sydes  were al blood
 Sir Thopas eek  so wery was
ffor prikyng on the softe gras
So fiers  was his corrage
That doun he leyde hym  in the plas
To make his Steede  som solas
And yaf hym  good forage
 O Seinte Marie  benedicite
What eyleth  this loue at me
To bynde me  so soore
Me dremed  al this nyght pardee
An Elf queene  shal my lemman be
And slepe  vnder my gore
 An Elf queene  wol I haue ywys
ffor in this world  no womman is
Worthy to be my make 
in towne
Alle othere wommen  I forsake
And to an Elf queene  I me take
by dale  and eek by downe
  
 In to his Sadel  he clamb anoon
And priketh ouer  style and stoon
An Elf queene  for tespye
Til he so longe  hath riden and goon
That he foond  in a pryuee woon
The contree of ffairye 
So wylde
ffor in that contree  was ther noon  
     
Neither wyf  ne childe
 Til þat ther cam  a greet geaunt
His name was  sire Olifaunt
A perilous man of dede
He seyde child  by Termagaunt
But if thow pryke  out of myn haunt
Anon I sle thy Steede
 with Mace
 Heere is this queene  of ffairye
With harpe and pipe  and Symphonye
dwellyng in this place
 The child seyde  als mote I thee
Tomorwe  wil I meete thee 
Whan I haue myn Armowre
 And yet I hope  par ma fay
That thow shalt with this launcegay
Abyen it ful sowre
 Thy Mawe
Shal I percen  if I may
Er it be fully pryme of day
ffor here shaltow ben slawe
  
 Sire Thopas  drow abak ful faste
This geant at hym stones caste
Out of a fel staf slynge
 But faire escapeth  child Thopas
And al it was  thurgh goddes graas
And thurgh his fair berynge
Ȝet lesteth lordes  to my tale
Murier than the nyghtyngale
I wol yow rowne
How sire Thopas  with sydes smale
Prikyng ouer hyll and dale
Is come agayn to towne
 Hys murye men  comanded he
To make hym  bothe game and glee
ffor nedes moste he fighte
With a geant with heuedes thre
ffor paramour  and Iolitee
Of oon  that shoon ful brighte
 Do come he seyde  my Mynstrales
And Gestours  for to tellen tales
Anon  in myn Armyng
Of romances  that been reales
Of Popes  and of Cardynales
And eek of loue likyng
 They fette hym first swete wyn
And Mede eek in a Maselyn
And real Spicerye
Of gyngebred  that was ful fyn
And lycorys  and eek Comyn
With Sugre  that is trye
  
 He dide next his white leer
Of clooth of lake  fyn and cleer
A breech  and eek a Sherte
And next his Sherte  an Aketon
And ouer that an haubergeon
ffor percyng of his herte
 And ouer that a fyn hauberk
Was al ywroght of Iewes werk
fful strong it was of plate
And ouer that  his cote Armour  
As whit as is  a lilie flour
In which  he wol debate
 His sheeld was al  of gold so reed
And ther Inne was  a bores heed
A Charbocle  by his syde
And there he swoor  on Ale and breed
How þat the geant  shal be deed
Bityde  what bityde
 Hise Iambeux were  of quyrboily
His swerdes shethe  of Yuory
His helm  of laton bright
His Sadel was  of Rewel bon
His brydel  as the sonne shon
Or as the moone light
 His spere was  of fyn Cipres
That bodeth werre  and no thyng pes
The heed  ful sharpe ygrounde
His Steede was  al dappel gray
It goth an Ambel  in the way
fful softely  and rounde 
  
In londe
 Lo lordes myne  here is a fit
If ye wole  any moore of it
To telle it wol I fonde
n Ow hoold youre mouth per charitee
Bothe knyght and lady free
And herkneth to my spelle
 Of bataille  and of chiualry
And of ladyes  loue drury
Anon  I wol yow telle
 Men speken  of Romances of pris
Of Hornchild  and of Ypotys
Of Beves and Sir Gy
Of Sire lybeux  and playn damour
But sire Thopas  he bereth the flour
Of real Chiualry
 His goode Steede  al he bystrood
And forth vp on his wey he glood
As Sparcle  out of the bronde
 Vp on his Creest he bar a tour
And ther Inne stiked  a lilie flour
God shilde  his cors fro shonde
 And for he was  a knyght auntrous
He nolde slepen  in noon hous
But liggen in his hode
His brighte helm  was his wonger
And by hym  bayteth his destrer
Of herbes  fyne and goode
  
 Hym self  drank water of the well
As dide the knyght Sire Percyuell
So worly vnder wede
Til on a day

Namoore of this  for goddes dignytee
Quod oure Hoost for thow makest me
So wery  of thy verray lewednesse  
That also wisly  god my soule blesse
Myne erys aken  of thy drasty speche
Now swich a rym  the deuel I biteche
This may wel be  rym dogerel quod he
 Why so quod I  why wiltow lette me
Moore of my tale  than another man
Syn that it is  the beste rym I kan
 By god quod he  for pleynly at o word
Thy drasty rymyng is nat worth a tord
Thow doost noght ellis  but despendest tyme
Sire at o word  thow shalt no lenger ryme
Lat se  wher thow kanst tellen aught in geste
Or tel in Prose  som what at the leeste
In which ther be som myrthe  or som doctrine
 Gladly quod I  by goddes swete pyne
I wol yow telle  a litel thyng in prose
That oghte like yow  as I suppose
Or ellis certes  ye be to daungerous
It is a moral tale vertuous
Al be it toold som tyme in sondry wise
Of sondry folk  as I shal yow deuyse
 As thus  ye woot þat euery Euaungelist
That telleth vs  the peyne of Ihesu Crist
Ne seith nat alle thyng as his felawe dooth
But nathelees  hir sentence is al sooth
And alle acorden  as in hir sentence
Al be ther  in hir tellyng difference

Whan they  his pitous passion expresse

But doutelees  hir sentence is al oon
 Therfore  lordynges alle  I yow biseche
If þat ye thynke  I varie  as in my speche
As thus  thogh þat I telle somwhat moore
Of prouerbes  than ye han herd bifore

Blameth me nat  for as in my sentence  
Shul ye  nowher  fynden difference

After the which  this myry tale I write
And therfore herkneth  what þat I shal seye
And lat me tellen  al my tale I preye

BY that the 1Manciple1 hadde his tale al ended
The Sonne  fro the South lyne is descended
So lowe  that he nas nat to my sighte
Degrees 29 as of highte
Ten of the Clokke  it was  so as I gesse
ffor xj foot and litel moore  or lesse
My shadwe was  at thilke tyme as there
Of swich feet as my lengthe parted weere
In 6 feet equal  of proporcion
Ther with  the Mones exaltacion
I mene Libra  alwey gan ascende
As we were entryng at a Thropes ende
ffor which oure hoost as he was wont to gye
As in this cas  oure Ioly compaignye

Thow getest fable noon  ytoold for me
ffor Poul  that writeth vn to Thymothe
Repreueth hem  þat weyuen Soothfastnesse
And tellen fables  and swich wrecchednesse
Why sholde I sowen draf out of my fest
Whan I may sowen whete  if þat me lest
ffor which I seye  þat if yow list to heere  
Moralitee  and vertuous matere
And thanne  þat ye wol yeue me Audience

Do yow plesance  leueful  as I kan
But trusteth wel  I am a Southren man
I kan nat geste  rom  ram  ruf  by lettre
Ne god woot rym holde I but litel bettre
And ther fore if yow lest I wol nat glose
I wol yow telle  a myrie tale in prose
To knytte vp al this feste  and make an ende
And Ihesu for his grace  wit me sende
To shewe yow the wey  in this viage
Of thilke parfit glorious pilgrymage

And if ye vouche sauf anon I shal
Bigynne vp on my tale  for which I preye
Telle youre auys  I kan no bettre seye
But nathelees  this meditacion

Of clerkes  for I am nat textuel

Ther fore  I make protestacion
That I wol stonde  to correccion
  
 Vp on this word  we han assented soone
ffor as it semed  it was for to doone
To enden  in som vertuous sentence
And for to yeue hym  space and audience
And bede oure hoost he sholde to hym seye
That alle we  to telle his tale hym preye
 Oure hoost hadde the wordes for vs alle
Sire preest quod he  now faire yow bifalle
Sey what yow list and we wol gladly heere
And with that word  he seyde in this manere
Telleth quod he  youre meditacion
But hasteth yow  the sonne wole adoun
Beth fructuous  and that in litel space
And to do wel  god sende yow his grace
Lythen and listeneþe and harkeneþe Arighte
And ye schulne here of A doughty knyghte
Sir Iohan of Boundis was his name
He couþe of norture And mochell of game
Thre sonnes þe knyghte hadde with his bodye wonne
The eldeste was a mocche schrewe And soone he bigonne
His breþerne louede wele her ffadre And of hym were Agaste
The eldeste desaruede his ffaders Curse And hadde hitt atte þe laste
The gode knyghte his ffadre lyuede so ȝore
That deþe was hym comen And handelede hym ffulle sore
The gode knyghte carede sore syke þere he laye
How his chyldron schulde lyuen Affter his daye  
He hadde bene wyde where buttenon husbande he was
All the londe that he hadde it was purchas  
ffayn he wolde it were dressid among hem alle
That eche of hem had his part as it myght falle
Tho sent he in to contre after wise knyghtis
To helpe delen his londis and dressen hem to rightis
He sent hem word bi lettres thei schulde hye blyue
Yf thei wolde speke with hym while he was on lyue


Tho the knyghtis herden sike that he lay
Had thei no rest nother nyght ne day
Till thei come to hym ther he lay stille
On his deth bed to abide goddis wille
Then seide the good knyght sike ther he lay
Lordis I yow warne for sothe without nay
I may no lenger lyuen here in this stounde
ffor thorough goddis will deth drawes me to grounde
Ther nas non of hem alle that herde hym a right
That thei ne had routhe of that ilke knyght
And seiden sir for goddis loue ne dismay you noght
God may done bote of bale that is now wrought
Than spake the good knyght sike there he lay
Bote of bale god may sende I wot it is no nay
But I beseke you knyghtis for the loue of me
Goth and dressith my londis among my sones thre
And for the loue of god delith not hem a mys
And foryeteth not Gamelyn my yong sone that is
Taketh hede to that one as well as to that other
Seeld ye seen any heier helpen his brother
Tho leten thei the knyght lyen that was not in hele
And wentyn in to counseile his londis for to dele
ffor to delen hem alle to oon that was here thoght
And for Gamelyn was yongist he schulde haue noght
All the londe that ther was thei dalten it in two
And letyn Gamelyn the yong withouten lond go
And eche of hem seide to other full lowde
His brethren myght yeue hym londe when he good cowde
When thei had delid the londe at here wille
Thei comen to the knyght there he lay stille
And tolde hym anon how thei had wroght
And the knyght ther he lay likid it right noght
 Than seide the knyght be seynt Martyn
ffor all that ye haue don yet is the londe myn
ffor goddis loue neighboris stondith stille
And I will delyn my lond right aftir my wille


Iohn my eldist sone schall haue plowes fyue
That was myn fadris heritage while he was on lyue
And my myddlist sone fyue plowes of londe
That I halp for to gete with my right honde
And all myn other purchas of londis and ledis  
That I bequethe Gamelyn and all my good stedis
And beseke you good men that lawe con of londe
ffor Gamelyns loue that my quest stonde
Thus dalt the knyght his londe bi his day
Right on his deth bed sike ther he lay
And sone aftirward he lay stoon stille
And died whan tyme come as it was cristes wille
Anoon as he was deed and vndir gras graue
Sone the eldir brother giled the yong knaue
He toke in to his honde his londe and his lede
And Gamelyn hym self to clothen and to fede
He clothed hym and fedde hym yuell and eke wrothe
And lete his londis forfare and his housis bothe
His parkes and his wodis and dide no thyng welle
And sithen he it abought on his owne felle
So long was Gamelyn in his brothris halle
ffor the strengest of good will thei doutedyn hym alle
Ther was none ther yn nother yong ne olde
That wolde wrath Gamelyn were he neuyr so bolde
 Gamelyn stood on a day in his brothers yerde
And bigan with his honde to hondill his berde
He thought on his londis that lay vnsawe
And his faire okis that doune were drawe
His Parkis were broken and his dere reuyd
Of all his good stedis noon was hym bileuyd
His housis were vnhiled and full yuell dight
Tho thought Gamelyn it went not aright
Aftirwarde cam his brother walkyng thare
And seide to Gamelyn is our mete yare
Tho wrathed hym Gamelyn and swore bi goddis book
Thou schalt go bake thi self I will not be thi Cook


Now brother Gamelyn how vnswarest thou now
Thou spakest neuyr suche a worde as thou dost now
Be my feith seide Gamelyn now me thynketh nede
Of alle the harmes that I haue I toke neuyr yet hede
My parkis ben broken and my deer bireuyd
Of myn armes and my stedis noght is me bileuyd
All that my fadir me biquath all goth to schame
And therfore haue thou goddis curs brother be thyn name
Than spake his brother that rape was of rees
Stonde stille gadlyng and holde thi pees
Thou schalt be fayn to haue thi mete and thi wede
What spekest thou gadlyng of londe or of lede
Than seide Gamelyn the childe that was yeng
Cristes curs mote he haue that clepeth me gadlyng
I am no worse gadlyng ne no worse wight
But borne of a lady and geten of a knyght  
Ne dorst he not to Gamelyn neuer a foot go
But clepid to hym his men and seide to hem tho
Goth and betith this boy and reueth hym his witte
And lete hym lerne a nother tyme to vnsware me bette
Then seide the childe yong Gamelyn
Cristis curs mote thou haue brother art thou myn
And if I schall algate be betyn anoon
Cristes curs mote thou haue but thou be that oon
And anon his brother in that grete hete
Made his men to fette staues Gamelyn to bete
When euery of hem had a staff nomen
Gamelyn was ware tho he sigh hem comen
Tho Gamelyn sigh hem comen he lokid ouer all
And was war of a pestell stood vndir the wall
Gamelyn was light and thider gon to lepe
And droff alle his brethers men right sone on an hepe
And lokid as a wilde lion and leide on good wone
Tho his brother sigh that he began to gone
He fleigh vp in to a lofte and schette the dore faste
Thus Gamelyn with his pestell made hem alle agaste


Some for Gamelyns loue and some for eie
Alle thei drowhen hem to halues tho he gan to pleie
What now seide Gamelyn euyll mote ye the
Will ye begynne contek and so sone fle
Gamelyn sought his brother whither he was flowe
And saugh where he loked oute at a wyndowe
Brother seide Gamelyn come a litell nere
And I will teche the to pleie at the bokelere
His brother hym answerde and seide be seynt Richere
While that pestell is in thi honde I will come no nere
Brother I will make thi pees I swere bi cristes ore
Cast aweie the pestell and wrath the no more
I most nede seide Gamelyn wrath me at ones
ffor thou wolde make thi men to breke my bones
Ne had I had mayn and myght in myn armes
To haue putte hem fro me thei wolde haue do me harmes
 Gamelyn seide his brother be thou not wroth
ffor to seen the haue harme me it were right loth
I ne dide it noght brother but for a fondyng
ffor to loken if thou art strong and art so yeng
Come adoune then to me and graunt me my bone
Of oo thyng I will the axe and we schull saught sone
Doune than come his brother that fekill was and felle
And was swithe sore aferd of the pestelle
He seide brothir Gamelyn axe me thi bone
And loke thou me blame but I it graunt sone
Than seide Gamelyn brother ywis  
 And we schull be at one thou muste graunte me this
All that my fadir me byquath while that he was on lyue
Thou muste do me it haue yef we schull not stryue
That schalt thou haue Gamelyn I swere be cristes ore
All that thi fadir the byquath though thou woldest haue more
Thi londe that lieth leye well it schall be sowe
And thyn housis reisid vp that ben leide full lowe
Thus seide the knyght to Gamelyn with mouth
And thought on falsnes as he well couth


The knyght thought on treson and Gamelyn on noon
And wente and kissed his brother and whan thei were at oon
Allas yong Gamelyn no thyng he ne wiste
With suche fals treson his brother hym kiste
 Lyitheneth and listeneth and holdith your tonge
And ye schull here talkyng of Gamelyn the yonge
Ther was ther be siden cried a wrastlyng
And therfore ther was sette a Ram and a Ryng
And Gamelyn was in will to wende therto
ffor to preuyn hys myght what he coude do
Brother seide Gamelyn be seynt Richere
Thou moste lene me to nyght a litell cursere
That is fresch to the sporis on for to ride
I most on an erand a litell here be side
Bi god seide his brother of stedis in my stalle
Go and chese the the best spare noon of hem alle
Of stedis and of cursers that stonden hem be side
And telle me good brother whider thou wilt ride
Here be side brother is cried a wrastlynge
And there fore schall be set a Ram and Rynge
Moche worschip it were brother to vs alle
Might I the Ram and the Ryng bryngen home to this halle
A stede ther was sadelid smertly and skete
Gamelyn dide a peire of sporis faste on his fete
He sette his foot in the stirop the stede he bistrood
And toward the wrastlynge the yong childe rood
Tho Gamelyn the yonge was riden oute at gate
The fals knyght his brother loked yet aftir thate
And besought ihesu crist that is heuyn kyng
He myght breke his nekke in that wrastlyng
As sone a Gamelyn come there the place was
He light downe of his stede and stood on the gras
And there he herde a ffrankeleyn welaweie syng
And bigan bitterly his hondis for to wryng
Gode man seide Gamelyn whi makist thou this fare
Is ther no man that may you helpen out of care


Allas seide the ffrankeleyn that euyr I was bore
ffor twey stalworth sones I wene that I haue lore  
A Champion is in the place that hath wrought me sorowe
ffor he hath slayne my two sones but yef god hem borowe
I woll yeue ten pounde bi ihesu criste and more
With the nones that I fonde a man to handle hym sore
Gode man seide Gamelyn wilt thou well done
Holde my hors while my man draweth of my schone
And helpe my man to kepe my clothes and my stede
And I will in to place gone to loke if I may spede
By god seide the ffrankeleyn it schall be done
I will my self be thi man to drawe of thi schone
And wende thou in to place ihesu criste the spede
And drede not of thi clothis ne of thi good stede
Barfoot and vngirt Gamelyn yn cam
Alle that were in the place hede of hym thei nam
How he dorste auntre hym to done his myght
That was so doughti a Champioun in wrastlyng and in fight
Vp sterte the Champion rapeli anoon
Toward yong Gamelyn he bigan to goon
And seide who is thi fadir and who is thi sire
ffor sothe thou arte a gret fooll that thou come here
 Gamelyn answerde the Champion tho
Thou knewe well my fadir while he couthe go
Whiles he was on lyue be seynt Martyn
Sir Ion of Boundis was his name and I Gamelyn
ffelawe seide the Champion so mote I thryue
I knewe well thi fadir whiles he was on lyue
And thi self Gamelyn I will that thou it here
While thou were a yong boy a moche schrewe thou were
Than seide Gamelyn and swore bi cristes ore
Now I am older wax thou schalt fynde me a more
By god seide the Champion well come mote thou be
Come thou ones in my honde thou schalt neuer the
 It was well withyn the nyght and the mone schone
When Gamelyn and the Champion to gider gon gone


The Champion cast tornes to Gamelyn that was prest
And Gamelyn stood and bade hym done his best
Than seide Gamelyn to the Champioun
Thou art fast aboute to bryng me adoun
Now I haue proued mony tornes of thyne
Thou most he seide proue oon or two of myne
Gamelyn to the Champion yede smertly anone
Of all the tornes that he couthe he schewid hym but one
And kest hym on the lift side that thre ribbes tobrake
And therto his one arme that yaf a gret crake
Than seide Gamelyn smertly anoon
Schall it be holde for a cast or ellis for noon
By god seide the Champion whether it be  
He that cometh ones in thi honde schall he neuyr the
Than seide the ffrankeleyn that had his sones there
Blessid be thou Gamelyn that euyr thou bore were
The ffrankeleyn seide to the Champion on hym stood hym noon eye
This is yong Gamelyn that taught the this pleye
Ayen vnswarid the Champion that liked no thyng well
He is alther maister and his pleie is right fell
Sithen I wrastlid first it is gone yore
But I was neuyr in my lyf handelid so sore
Gamelyn stood in the place anon without serke
And seide if ther be mo lete hem come to werke
The Champion that payned hym to wirke sore
Hit semeth bi his contenaunce that he will no more
Gamelyn in the place stood still as stoon
ffor to abide wrastlyng but ther come noon
Ther was non with Gamelyn that wolde wrastle more
ffor he handlid the Champion so wondirly sore
Two gentill men yemed the place
Come to Gamelyn god yeue hym good grace
And seide to hym do on thi hosen and thi schoon
fforsothe at this tyme this faire is doon
And than seide Gamelyn so mote I well fare
I haue not yet hauyndell sold my ware


 Tho seide the Champion so brok I my swere
He is a fooll that therof bieth thou sellest it so dere
Tho seide the frankeleyn that was in moche care
ffelaw he seide whi lakkest thou this ware
Be seynt Iame in Gales that mony man hath soght
Yet is it to good chepe that thou hast boght
Tho that wardeyns were of that wrastlyng
Come and brought Gamelyn the Ram and the Ryng
    
    
A Gamelyn thought it was a faire thyng
And went with moche ioye home in the mornyng
His brother sigh where he came with the gret route
And bad schit the gate and holde hym withoute
The porter of his lord was sore agast
And sterte anoon to the gate and lokked it fast
 Now litheþ and listeneth bothe yong and olde
And ye schull here gamyn of Gamelyn the bolde
Gamelyn come to þe yate for to haue come yn
Than was it schit fast with a pyn
Than seide Gamelyn porter vndo the yate
ffor a gode mannes sone stondeþ therate
Than answarde the porter and sware bi goddis berde
Thou ne schalt Gamelyn come in to this yerde
Thou lixt seide Gamelyn so broke I my chyn
He smote the wiket with his foot and brake awaye the pyn  
The porter sigh tho it myght no better be
He sette foot on erthe and began to flee
Be my fay seide Gamelyn that traueile is lore
ffor I am on foote as light as thou haddist it swore
Gamelyn ouertoke the porter and his tene wrake
And girt hym in the nekke that the boon tobrake
And toke hym by that one arme and threwe hym in a welle
VijC fadome it was depe as I haue herd telle
Whan Gamelyn the yong thus had pleide his plaie
Alle that in the yeerde were drowen hem awaie


Thei dredyn hym full sore for werke that he wrought
And for the faire companye that he thider brought
Gamelyn yede to the yate and lete it vp wide
He lete yn alle that gone wolde or ride
And seide ye be welcome without any greue
ffor we will be maisters here and axe no man leue
Yestirday I left seide yong Gamelyne
In my brother seler fyue toun wyne
I will not this companye parten on twyn
And ye will don aftir me while sope is theryn
And if my brother gruche or make foule chere
Other of spence of mete and drynke that we spende here
I am our catour and bere our alther purs
He schall haue for his grucchyng seynt Marie curs
Mi brother is a nygon I swere be cristes ore
And we will spende largely that he hath sparid yore
And who that maketh grucchyng that we here dwelle
He schall to the porter in to the draw welle
Vij daies and vij nyght Gamelyn helde his fest
With moche solace was there and non chest
In a litell toret his brother lay steke
And sigh hem waste his good and dorst not speke
 Erly in a mornyng on the viij day
The gestis come to Gamelyn and wolde gone here way
Lordis seide Gamelyn will ye so hye
All the wyne is not yet dronke so broke I myn eye
Gamelyn in his herte was full wo
When his gestis toke here leue fro hym for to go
He wolde thei had dwellid lenger and thei seide nay
But bitaught Gamelyn god and good day
Thus made Gamelyn his fest and brought it well to ende
And after his gestis toke leue to wende
 Litheth and listenyth and holdith your tonge
And ye schull here gamen of Gamelyn the yonge
Herkenyth lordyngis and listneth aright
When alle gestis were gone how Gamelyn was dight


All the while that Gamelyn helde his mangerie  
His brothir thought on hym be wreke with his trecherie
Tho Gamelyns gestis were riden and gone
Gamelyn stood anone allone frend had he none
Tho aftir fell sone withyn a litill stonde
Gamelyn was taken and full hard bonde
fforth come the fals knyght out of the solere
To Gamelyn his brother he yede full nere
And seide to Gamelyn who made the so bolde
ffor to stroien my stour of my housholde
Brother seide Gamelyn wrath the right noght
ffor it is mony day gone sith it was boght
ffor brother þe profite thou hast had be seynt Richere
Of xv plowes of londe this sixtene yere
And of alle the bestis thou hast forth bredde
That my fadir me biquath on his deth bedde
Of all this sixtene yere I yeue the the prowe
ffor the mete and the drynke that we haue spendid nowe
Than seide the fals knyght euyll mote he the
Herken brother Gamelyn what I will yeue the
ffor of my body brother here geten haue I non
I will make the myn eire I swere bi seynt Iohn
Parfay seide Gamelyn and it so be
And thou thynkist as thou seist god yelde it the
No thyng wist Gamelyn of his brother gile
Therfore he hym bigiled in a litill while
Gamelyn seide he oo thyng I the telle
Tho thou threwe my porter in the drawe welle
I swoor in that wrath and in that gret moote
That thou schuldist be bounde both hond and foote
    
    
ffor to holden myn avow as I the bihote
To ben myn heire of londe hous and cote
Brother seide Gamelyn as mote I the
Thou schalt not be forswore for the loue of me


Tho maden thei Gamelyn to sitte for he schulde not stonde
Till thei had hym bounde bothe foot and honde
The fals knyght his brother of Gamelyn was agast
And sent aftir feters to feteren hym fast
His brother made lesyngis on hym there he stood
And tolde hem that comen yn that Gamelyn was wood
Gamelyn stode to a post bounden in the halle
Tho that comen yn lokid on hym alle
Euer stood Gamelyn euyn vp right
But mete ne drynke had he non neither day ne nyght
Than seide Gamelyn brother be myn hals
Now I haue aspied thou art a parti fals
Had I wist the treson that thou hast founde
I wolde haue yeue strokis or I had be bounde  
Gamelyn stoed bounde stille as ony stoon
Two daies and two nyghtis mete had he noon
Than seide Gamelyn that stoed ybounde strong
Adam spenser me thynketh I fast to long
Adam spenser now I beseche the
ffor the moche loue my fadir loued the
Yf thou may come to the keys lese me out of bond
And I will parte with the of my fre lond
Than seide Adam that was the spenser
I haue seruyd thi brother this xvj yere
Yf I lete the goon out of his boure
He wolde saie aftirwarde I were a traitoure
Adam seide Gamelyn so brok I myn hals
Thou schalt fynde my brother at the last fals
Therfore brother Adam lose me out of bondis
And I will parte with the of my fre londis
Vp suche forward seide Adam ywis
I will do therto all that in me is
Adam seide Gamelyn as mote I the
I will holde the couenaunt and thou will helpe me
Anoon as Adams lord to bedde was goon
Adam toke the keyes and lete Gamelyn out anoon


He vnlokked Gamelyn bothe hondis and feet
In hope of auauncement that he hym biheet
Than seide Gamelyn thankid be goddis sonde
Now I am lose bothe foot and honde
Had I now eten and dronken aright
Ther is noon in this hous schulde bynde me this nyght
Adam toke Gamelyn as stille as ony stoon
And lad hym in to spense raply anoon
And sette hym to soper right in a pryue stede
He bad hym do gladly and Gamelyn so dide
Anoon as Gamelyn had eten well and fyne
And therto dronken well of the rede wyne
Adam seide Gamelyn what is now thi reed
Or I go to my brother and gird of his heed
Gamelyn seide Adam it schall not be so
I con teche the a rede that is worth the two
I wote well for sothe that this is no nay
We schull haue a mangerie right on sonday
Abbotes and priours mony here schall be
And other men of holy chirche as I telle the
Thou schalt stonde vp bi the post as thou were bound fast
And I schall leue hem vnloke that aweie thou may hem cast
Whan that thei haue eten and waschen here hondis
Thou schalt biseke hem alle to bryng the out of bondis
And if thei will borow the that were good game  
Than were thou out of prison and I out of blame
And if eche of hem saie to vs nay
I schall do a nother I swere be this day
Thou schalt haue a good staf and I will haue a nother
And cristes curs haue that oon that faileth that other
Ye for god seide Gamelyn I say it for me
If I faile on my side yuell mote I the
Yf we schull algate assoile hem of here synne
Warne me brother Adam whan we schull begynne
Gamelyn seide Adam be seynt charite
I will warne the biforne whan it schall be


Whan I wynk on the loke for to gone
And cast aweie thi feters and come to me anone
Adam seide Gamelyn blessid be thy bones
That is a good counseile yeuen for the nones
Yf thei warne me to bryng me out of bendis
I will sette good strokes right on here lendis
Tho the sonday was comen and folke to the feste
ffaire thei were welcomed bothe leste and meste
And euer as thei at halle dore come yn
Thei cast here ye on yong Gamelyn
The fals knyght his brother full of trecherie
Alle the gestis that ther were at the mangerie
Of Gamelyn his brother he tolde hem with mouth
All the harme and the schame that he telle couth
Tho thei were seruyd of messis two or thre
Than seide Gamelyn how serue ye me
It is noght well seruyd bi god that all made
That I sitte fastyng and other men make glade
The fals knyght his brother ther as he stood
Tolde alle gestis that Gamelyn was wood
And Gamelyn stood stille and vnswared right noght
But Adams wordis he helde in his thoght
Tho Gamelyn gan speke deolfully with alle
To the gret lordis that seeten in the halle
Lordis he seide for cristes passion
Helpe to bryng Gamelyn out of prison
Than seide an Abbot sorow on his cheke
He schall haue cristes curs and seynt maries eke
That the out of prison beggith or borow
But euer worth hym well that doth the moche sorow
Aftir that abbot than spake a nother
I wolde thyn heed were of theigh thou were my brother
Alle that the borow foule mote hem falle
Thus thei seiden alle that were in the halle
Than seide a priour euyll mote he preue
It is gret sorow and care boy thou art on lyue  

Ow seide Gamelyn so broke I my bone
Now I haue spied that frendis haue I none
Cursed mote he worth both flesch and blood
That euer doth priour or Abbot any good
Adam the spenser toke vp the cloth
And loked on Gamelyn and sigh that he was wroth
Adam on the pantrie litill thoght
But two good staues to the halle dore he broght
Adam loked on Gamelyn and he was ware anone
And cast aweie the feters and bigan to gone
Tho he cam to Adam he toke the oon staf
And bigan to worche and good strokes yaf
Gamelyn come in to the halle and Adam spenser bothe
And lokid hem aboute as thei had ben wrothe
Gamelyn spreyneth holi water with a Oken spire
That some that stood vp right fell in the fire
Ther was no lewid man that in the halle stood
That wolde do Gamelyn any thyng but good
But stodyn be siden and lete hem both wirche
ffor thei had no reweth of men of holi chirche
Abbot or priour Monk or Chanoun
That Gamelyn ouertoke anoon thei yeden doun
Ther was non of alle that with his staf mette
That he made hem ouerthrowe and quyt hem his dette
Gamelyn seide Adam for seynt charite
Paie good lyueray for the loue of me
And I will kepe the dore so euer here I masse
Er thei ben assoiled ther schall noon passe
Doute the noght seide Gamelyn while we ben in fere
Kepe thou well the dore and I will worche here
Bystere the good Adam and let ther non fle
And we schull telle largely how mony that ther be
Gamelyn seide Adam do hem but good
Thei ben men of holy chirche drawe of hem no blood
Saue well the crowne and do hem no harmes
But breke both her leggis and sithen her armes


Thus Gamelyn and Adam wroght right fast
And pleide with the monkis and made hem agast
Thider thei come rydyng ioly with swaynes
And home ayen thei were lad in cartis and waynes
Tho thei hadden alle ydoo then seide a gray ffrere
Alas sir Abbot what dide we now here
Tho that we comen hider it was a colde reede
Vs hadde ben better at home with water and with breede
While Gamelyn made ordris of monkis and frere
Euyr stood his brother and made foule chere
Gamelyn vp with his staf that he well knew  
And girt hym in the nek that he ouer threw
A litill aboue the girdill the rigge boon tobrast
And sette hym in the feters ther he satt arst
Sitte there brother seide Gamelyn
ffor to colen thi body as I dide myn
As swithe as thei haddyn wroken hem on her foon
Thei asked water and waschen anoon
What some for her loue and some for her awe
Alle the seruauntis serueth hem of the best lawe
 The Schereue was thenne but fyue myle
And all was tolde hym in a litell while
How Gamelyn and Adam haden doone a sory res
Bounden and wounden men ayens the kyngis pes
Tho bigan sone strif for to wake
And the Schireue aboute Gamelyn for to take
 Now litheþ and listneth so god yeue you good fyne
And ye schull here good game of yong Gamelyne
ffoure and twenti yong men that helden hem full bolde
Come to the schireue and seide that thei wolde
Gamelyn and Adam fette bi her fay
The Schirreue yeue hem leue soth for to say
Thei hyeden fast wolde thei not lynne
Till thei come to the gate there Gamelyn was ynne
Thei knokkeden on the gate the porter was nyghe
And lokid out at an hole as man that was slighe


The porter had biholde hem a litull while
He louyd well Gamelyn and was drad of gile
And lete the wiket stond full stille
And asked hem withoute what was here wille
 ffor alle the gret companye than spak but oon
Vndo the gate porter and lete vs yn goon
Than seide the porter so brouke I my chyn
Ye schull saie your erand yer ye come yn
Saie to Gamelyn and Adam yf theire will be
We will speke with hem two wordes or thre
ffelaw seide the porter stonde there stille
And I will wende to Gamelyn to wite his wille
In wente the porter to Gamelyn anoon
And seide sir I warne you here be comen your foon
The Schereuys men ben atte the gate
ffor to take you both schull ye not scape
Porter seide Gamelyn so mote I well the
I will allow the thi wordis when I my tyme se
Go ageyn to the gate and dwelle with hem a while
And thou schalt se right sone porter a gile
Adam seide Gamelyn loke the to gone
We haue foomen atte yate and frendis neuer one  
Hit ben the Schereuys men that hider ben come
Thei be swore togider that we schall be nome
Gamelyn seide Adam hye the right blyue
And if I faile the this day euyll mote I thryue
And we schull so welcome the Schereuys men
That some of hem schall make here beddis in the fen
At a posterne gate Gamelyn out went
And a good cartstaf in his honde hent
Adam hent sone a nother gret staf
ffor to helpen Gamelyn and good strokis yaf
Adam fell tweyne and Gamelyn fell thre
The other sette feet on erthe and bigan to fle
What seide Adam so euyr here I masse
I haue right good wyne drynke or ye passe


Nay bi god seide thei thi drynke is not good
It wolde make a mannes brayn to lyen in his hood
Gamelyn stood stille and lokid hym aboute
And seide the schereue cometh with a gret route
Adam seide Gamelyn what ben now thi redis
Here cometh the schereue and will haue our hedis
Adam seide to Gamelyn myn rede is now this
Abide we no lenger lest we fare amys
I rede that we to wode gone or that we be founde
Better is there louse than in towne be bounde
Adam toke bi the honde yong Gamelyne
And euery of hem drank a draught of wyne
And after token her cours and wenten her way
Tho fonde the schereue nest but non ay
The schereue light doun and wente in to halle
And fonde the lorde feterid fast with alle
The schereue vnfeterid hym right sone anoon
And sent aftir a leche to hele his rigge boon
 Lete we now the fals knyght lie in his care
And talke we of Gamelyn and loke how he fare
Gamelyn in to the wode stalkid stille
And Adam spenser liked this ille
Adam swore to Gamelyn be seynt Richere
Now I se it is mery to be a spensere
That leuyr me were keies to bere
Than walken in this wilde wode my clothis to tere
Adam seide Gamelyn dismay the right nought
Mony a good mannys childe in care is brought
As thei stood talkyng bothen in fere
Adam herde talkyng of men and nygh hem thought thei were
Tho Gamelyn vndir wode lokid aright
Seuyn score of yong men he sigh well dight
Alle sate at the mete compas aboute  
Adam seide Gamelyn now haue I no doute
After bale cometh bote thorogh goddis myght
Me thynke of mete and drynke I haue a sight


Adam loked tho vndir wode bough
And tho he say mete and he was glad ynough
ffor he hoped to god to haue his dele
And he was sore alonged after a good mele
As he seide that worde the maister outlawe
Saugh Adam and Gamelyn vndir wode schawe
Yonge men seide the maister bi the good rode
I am war of gestis god sende vs gode
Yonde ben two yonge men well adight
And perauenture ther ben more who so lokid aright
Ariseth vp yong men and fette hem to me
It is good that we witen what men thei be
Vp ther stertyn seuene fro the dyner
And metten with Gamelyn and Adam spenser
Whan thei were nyghe hem than seide that one
Yeldeth vp yonge men your bowes and your flone
Than seide Gamelyn that yong was of elde
Moche sorow mote thei haue that to you hem yelde
I course non other but right my selue
Thei ye fette to you fyue than be ye twelue
Tho thei herde bi his worde that myght was yn his arme
Ther was non of hem that wolde do hem harme
But seide to Gamelyn myldely and stille
Come afore our maister and say to hym thi wille
Yonge men seide Gamelyn be your lewte
What man is your maister that ye with be
Alle thei answerde withoute lesynge
Our maister is crowned of outlawis kynge
Adam seide Gamelyn go we in cristes name
He may neither mete ne drynke werne vs for schame
Yf that he be hende and come of gentill blood
He will yeue vs mete and drynke and do vs some good
Be seynt Iame seide Adam what harme that I gete
I will auenture me that I had mete
Gamelyn and Adam went forth in fere
And thei grette the maister  that thei fonde there


 Than seide the maister  kyng of outlawes
What seke ye yonge men vndir wode schawes
Gamelyn answerde the kyng with his crowne
He most nedis walke in felde that may not walke in towne
Sire we walke not here non harme to do
But if we mete a deer to schete therto
As men that ben hungry and mow no mete fynde
 And ben hard bestad vndir wode lynde  
Of Gamelyn wordis the maister had reuthe
And seide ye schall haue ynogh haue god my treuthe
He bad hem sitte doun for to take reste
And bad hem ete and drynke and that of the beste
As thei eten and dronken well and fyne
Than seide oon to a nother this is Gamelyne
Tho was the maister outlawe in to counseile nome
And tolde how it was Gamelyn that thider was come
Anon as he herde how it was befalle
He made hym maister vndir hym ouer hem alle
Withyn the thrid wike hym come tithyng

That he schulde come home his pees was made
And of that good tithyng he was full glade
Tho seide he to his yong men soth for to telle
Me ben comen tithynges I may no lenger dwelle
Tho was Gamelyn anon withoute tariyng
Made maister outlawe and crowned her kyng
Tho was Gamelyn crowned kyng of outlawes
And walkid a while vndir wode schawes
 The fals knyght his brother was schereue and sire
And lete his brother endite for hate and for hire
Tho were his bondemen sory and no thyng glade
When Gamelyn her lorde wolfes heed was cried and made
And sent out of his men where thei myght hym fynde
ffor to go seke Gamelyn vndir wode lynde
To telle hym tithyng the wynde was went
All his good reuyd and alle his men schent


Whan thei hadden hym founde on knees thei hem setten
And adoun with here hood and her lorde gretten
Sir wrath yow nought for the good rode
ffor we han brought you tithyng but thei be not gode
Now is thi brother schereue and hath the baillie
And hath endited the and wolfes heed doth the crie
Allas seide Gamelyn that euer I was so slak
That I ne had broke his nekke tho I his rigge brak
Goth greteth well boþe housbonde and wif
I will be at the next schire haue god my lyf
Gamelyn cam redy to the next schire
And ther was his brother both lorde and sire
Gamelyn boldely come in to the mote halle
And put adoun his hood amonge the lordis alle
God saue you lordynges that here be
But broke bak schereue euyll mote thou the
Whi hast thou do me that schame and vilonye
ffor to late endite me and wolfesheed do me crie
Tho thought the fals knyght for to ben awreke  
And let Gamelyn most he no thyng speke
Might ther be no grace but Gamelyn at the last
Was cast in prison and feterid fast
Gamelyn hath a brother that hight sir Ote
As a good a knyght and hende as myght gon on fote
Anon yede a messager to that good knyght
And tolde hym all togider how Gamelyn was dight
Anon as sire Ote herde how Gamelyn was dight
He was right sory was he no thyng light
And lete sadill a stede and the way he name
And to his tweie bretheryn right sone he came
Sire seide sir Ote to the schereue tho
We ben but thre bretheren schull we neuer be mo
And thou hast prisoned the best of vs alle
Suche a nother brother euyll mote hym bifalle
Sir Ote seide the fals knyght late be thi curs
By god for thi wordis he schall fare the wurs


To the kyngis prison he is ynome
And there he schall abide till the iustice come
Parde seide sir Ote bettir it schall be
I bid hym to maympris that thou graunte me
Till the next sittyng of delyueraunce
And late than Gamelyn stonde to his chaunce

But he be redy whan the iustice sitte

Late delyuer hym anon and take hym to me
Tho was Gamelyn delyuered to sir Ote his brother
And that nyght dwellid the oon with the other
On the morowen seide Gamelyn to sir Ote the hende
Brother he seide I mote for sothe fro you wende
To loke how my yong men leden here lyf
Whethir thei lyuen in ioy or ellis in strif
By god seide sir Ote that is a colde rede

Brother seide Gamelyn dismaie the noght

Than seide sir Ote to Gamelyn god schilde the fro schame
Come when thou seist tyme and bryng vs oute of blame
Litheth and listneth and hold yow stille
And ye schull here how Gamelyn had his wille  
Gamelyn wente vndir wode rys
And fonde ther plaiyng yong men of prys
Tho was yong Gamelyn right glad ynoghe
When he fonde his men vndir wode boghe
Gamelyn and his men talkeden in fere
And thei had good game here maister to here


His men tolde hym of auenturis that thei had founde
And Gamelyn hem tolde ayen how he was fast bounde
While Gamelyn was outlawe had he no cors
Ther was no man that for hym ferde the wors
But Abbotis and priours monk and Chanon
On hem left he noght when he myght hem nome
While Gamelyn and his men made myrthes ryue
The fals knyght his brother euyll mote he þryue
ffor he was fast aboute bothe day and other
ffor to hire the quest to hangen his brother
 Gamelyn stood on a day and behelde
The wodis and the schawis and the wilde filde
He thought on his brother how he hym behette
That he wolde be redy whan the iustice sette
He thought well he wolde withoute delay
Come afore the iustice to kepen his day
And seide to his yong men dighteth you yare
ffor whan the iustice sitte we moste be thare
ffor I am vndir borow till that I come
And my brother for me to prison schall be nome
Be seynt Iame seide his yong men and thou rede therto
Ordeyne how it schall be and it schall be do
While Gamelyn was comyng ther the iustice satte
The fals knyght his brother foryate he not that
To hire the men on his quest to hangen his brother
Thogh thei had not the oon thei wolde haue the other
Tho come Gamelyn fro vndir the wode rys
And broght with hym yong men of prys
I se well seide Gamelyn the Iustice is sette
Go aforn Adam and loke how it spette
Adam went in to the halle and loked all aboute
He sigh ther stonde lordis grete and stoute
And sir Ote his brother feterid full faste
Tho went Adam oute of halle as he were agaste
Adam seide to Gamelyn and to his felawis alle
Sir Ote stant feterid in the mote halle


    
    
Yf god yeue vs grace well for to do
He schall it abigge that it brought therto
Than seide Adam that lokkes had hore
Cristes curs mote he haue that hym bond so sore
And thou wilt Gamelyn do aftir my rede  
Ther is non in the halle schall bere awey his hede
Adam seide Gamelyn we will not do so
We will sle the giltif and late the other go
I will in to the halle and with the Iustice speke
On hem that ben giltif I will ben awreke
Lete non scape at the dore take yong men yeme

God spede me this day at my newe werke
Adam come with me for thou schalt be my clerke
His men vnswareden hym and bad hym done his beste
And if thou to vs haue nede thou schalt fynde vs preste
We will stonde with the while that we may dure
And but we wirken manly pay vs non hure
Yonge men seide Gamelyn so mote I well the
As trusti a maister ye schall fynde me
Right there the Iustice satte in the halle
In went Gamelyn amongis hem alle
Gamelyn lete vnfeter his brother out of bende
Than seide sir Ote his brother that was hende
Thou haddist almost Gamelyn dwellid to longe
ffor the quest is oute on me that I schulde be honge
Brother  seide Gamelyn so god yeue me good rest
This day thei schull ben hanged that ben on the quest
And the Iustice bothe that is the Iuge man
And the schereue bothe thorgh hym it began
 Than seide Gamelyn to the Iustice
Now is thi power done thou most nedis rise
Thou hast yeuyn domyb that ben yuell dight
I will sitten in thi sete and dressen hem aright


The Iustice sate stille and ros not anon
And Gamelyn in haste cleuyd his cheke bon
Gamelyn toke hym in his armys and no more spak
But threw him ouer the barre and his arme brak
Durst non to Gamelyn saie but good
ffor ferd of the companye that with hym oute stood
Gamelyn sette hym doun in the Iustice sete
And sir Ote his brother bi hym and Adam at his fete
Whan Gamelyn was sette in the Iustice stide
Herken of a bourde that Gamelyn dide
He lete feter the Iustice and his fals brother
And lete hem come to the barre that oon with that other
Tho Gamelyn had thus done had he no rest
Till he had enquerid who was on the quest
ffor to demyn his brother sir Ote for to honge
Er he wiste whiche thei were hym thoght full longe
But as sone as Gamelyn wiste where thei were
He dide hem euerychon feter in fere  
And bryngen hem to the barre and setten hem in rewe
Be my feith seide the Iustice the schereue is a schrewe
Than seide Gamelyn to the Iustice
Thou hast yeue domes of the worste assise
And the xij sisouris that weren on the quest
They schull be hangid this day so haue I good rest
Than seide the schereue to yong Gamelyn
Lorde I crie the mercy brother art thou myn
Therfore seide Gamelyn haue thou cristes curs
ffor and thou were mayster yet schulde I haue wurs
ffor to make schort tale and noght to longe
He ordeyned hym a quest of his men so stronge
The Iustice and the schereue bothe hangid hye
To weyuen with the ropis and with the wynde drye
And the xij sisours sorw haue that rekke
Alle thei were hangid fast bi the nekke
 Thus endid the fals knyght with his trechery
That euyr had lad his lif in falsnes and foly


He was hanged bi the nekke and not bi the purs
That was the mede that he had for his fadirs curs
Sir Otes was eldist and Gamelyn was yong
Wenten to here frendis and passedyn to the kyng
Thei maden pees with the kyng of the best sise
The kyng loued well sir Ote and made hym Iustice
And after the kyng made Gamelyn in Este and in west
Chief Iustice of his fre forest
Alle his wight yong men the kyng foryaf here gilt
And sithen in good office the kyng hath alle hem pilt
 Thus wan Gamelyn his londe and his lede
And wreke hym on hys enemyes and quyt hem here mede
And sir Ote his brother made hym his heier
And sithen weddid Gamelyn a wif good and feier
Thei lyueden togider  while that crist wolde
And sithen was Gamelyn grauen vndir molde
And so schall we alle may ther no man fle
God bryng vs to the ioy that euyr schall be  
SIr Nvnnys preest  our host seide anoon
Iblessid be thi breche  and every stoon
This was a mery tale  of Chantecleer
But bi my trouth  yiff thou were seculer
Thou woldist ben  a trede foule a riht
ffor yff thou coragge  as thou hast myht
The were neede  of hennys as I weene

See suche brawne  hath this gentil preest
So grete a neck  and such a large breest
He lookith as a sparhawk  with his eyen
Hym needith nat  his colour for to dyen
With brasill ne with greyn  off portyngal
Now sire fair falle you  for your tale
And aftir that  he with full mery cheer
Seid vnto the Nunne  as ye may heer
OWre oost vp on his stiropes stood anon
And saide godemen herkeneth euerichon
This was a thrifty tale for þe nones
Sire parisshe preest quod he for goddes bones
Telle vs a tale as was thi forward yore
I se wel that ye lernede men in lore
Can moche good by goddes dignete
The person him Answered benedicite
What eyleth the man so synfully to swere
Owre ooste answerd O Ianekyn be ye there
I smelle a lollere in the wynde quod he
How goodmen quod owre oost herkeneth me
Abideth for goddes digne passioun
ffor we shal haue a predicacioun
This lollere here wil prechen vs som what
Nay by my fader sowle that shal he nat
Seide þe squier here shal he nat preche
He shal no gospel glosen here no teche
He leueþ alle in the grete god he

Or springen Cokkel in owre clene corn
And therfore hoost y warne þe byforn
Mi Ioly body shal a tale telle
And I shal klynken yow so mery A belle
That I shal waken al this compaignye
But it shal not ben of philosophie
Ne phislyas ne termes queynte of lawe

We weddid men leve in sorow and Care
Asay whoso wolle And he shall fynde

Nowe quod owre Ost marchande so god yowe blesse
Synne ye so mekyll Con of that Arte
fful hertly I pray yowe telle vs parte 
Gladly quod he but of myn owne sore
ffor sory herte I tell may nomore
Whan ended was  the tale of seint Cecyle
Er we fully  had riden fif myle
At Boughton  vnder the blee  vs gan a take
A man that clothed was  in clothes blake
And vnder þat  he had a whit surplys
His hakeney that was  al pomel grys
So swette  that it wonder was to see
Hit semed he had  priked myles three
The hors eke  that his yoman rood vpon
So swette  þat vnnethe miȝte he goon
Aboute the peytrel  stood the foom ful hiȝe
He was of fome  al flekked as a pye
A male twifold  vpon his croper lay
It semed þat he caried  litel aray
Al light for somer  rood þis worthy man
And in myn herte  wondren I bigan
what þat he was  til þat I vnderstood
How þat his cloke  was swed to his hood
ffor which whan I longe  had avised me
I demed him  som chanon for to be
his hat heeng at his bak  doun by laas
ffor he had riden  more than trot or paas
He had ay priked  lyk as he were wood
A clote leef  he had vnder his hood
ffor swoot  and for to kepe his hede fro hete
But it was ioye  for to seen him swete
His forhed dropped  as a stillatorie
were ful of plannteyn  and of peritorie
  
And whan þat he com  he gan to crie
God saue quod he  this ioly companie
ffaste haue I priked  quod he for ȝoure sake
Be cause þat I wolde  ȝow ouertake
To ryden  in þis mery companie
His yoman eke  was ful of curtesie
And sire now  in the morwe tyde
Out of ȝoure Hostery  I saugh ȝow ryde  
And warned here  my lord and my souerayn
which þat to ride  with ȝow is ful fayn
ffor his disport  he loueth daliaunce
And for þi warnyng  god ȝeue þe good chaunce
Saide oure hoost  certes it wolde seme
Thy lord were wys  and so I may wel deme
He is ful iocunde  also dar I leye
Can he ought telle  a mery tale or tweye
with whiche  he glade  may þis companye
who sire my lord  ȝe ȝe withoute lye
He can of merthe  and eek of iolyte
Nouȝt but ynogh  also sire trusteth me
And ȝe him knewe  as wel as do I
Ȝe wolde wondre  how wel and thriftily
He couthe werke  and þat in sondry wise
He hath taken on him  many greet apprise
Whiche were ful hard  for any þat is here
To bringe aboute  but þei of him it lere
As homely as he rit  amonges ȝow
Ȝif ye him knewe  it wolde be ȝoure prow
Ȝe wolde not forgoon  his aqueyntance
ffor moche good  I dar leye in balance
Al þat I haue  in my possession
he is a man  of high discrecion
I warne ȝow wel  he is a passinge man
Wel quod oure hoost I pray þe tel me þan
Is he clerk or noon  tel what he is
Nay he is gretter  than a Clerk ywis
  
Seide the ȝoman  and in wordes fewe
Hoost of his craft  somwhat I wol ȝow shewe
I say my lord  can such a sotilte
But al his craft  ȝe may not wite at me
And somwhat helpe I ȝit  to his worchyng
That al þis grounde  þat we ben on ridyng
Til þat we come  to Cauntebury toun
He coude al clene  turne vp so doun
And paue it al  of siluer and of goold
And whan þis Ȝoman  had þus ytoold
 Vn to oure hoost  he saide benedicite  
This þing  is wonder  meruaillous to me
Sitthe þi lord  is of so high prudence
Be cause of which  men shulde him reuerence
That of his worshipe  rekketh  he so lyte
His ouer sloppe  is not worth a myte
As in effecte  to him so mote I go
It is al baudy  and totore also
Why is þi lord  so sluttish I the prey
And is of power  better cloþes for to bey
Ȝif þat his dede  accorde with þi speche
Tel me that  and þat I the beseche
 Whi quod þis ȝoman  wherto aske ȝe me
God helpe me so  for he shal neuer ythe
But I wol not  avowe that I say
And therfore kepe it secre  I yow pray
He is to wys  in feith as I beleue
That þat is ouerdone  it wol not preue
And right as clerkes seyn  it is a vice
Wherfore in þat  I holde him lewed and nyce
ffor whan a man  hath ouer greet a wit
fful ofte him happeth  to misvsen it
So doth my lord  and that me greueth sore
God it amende  I can say ȝow no more
 Therof no fors  goode yoman quod oure hoost
Sitthen of the cunnynge  of þi lord þou woost
  
Telle how he doth  I pray the hertely
Sitthen þat he is  so crafty  and so slyȝ
where dwelle ȝe  ȝif it tolle be
In the subarbe  of a toun quod 
Lurkynge in hernes  and in lanes blynde
where thise robbers  and theefs be kynde
Holden her priue  and ferful residence
As þei þat dar not shewen her presence
So fare we  ȝif I shal say the sothe
Ȝit quod oure hoost  lat me talke to the
Why art þou  discoloured on thy face
Petre quod he  god ȝeue it harde grace
I am so vsed  in the fyre to blowe
That it hath chaunged  my colour as I trowe  
I am not wont in no myrour to prie
But swynke sore  and lerne to multiplie
we bloundren euere  and pouren in the fyr
And for al þat we faylen  of oure desyr
ffor euere we lakken  oure conclusion
To moche folk we be  but illusion
And borwe gold  be it a pound or two
Or ten or twelue  or many sommes mo
And make hem wene  atte leste weye
That of a pound  we coude make tweye
Ȝit is it fals  and ay we han good hope
It for to done  and after it we grope
But þat science is  so fer vs biforn
we may not  al þogh we had it sworn
It ouertake  it slit awey so faste
It wol vs make  beggers atte laste
 Whiles this ȝoman  was þus in his talkyng
This chanon drow him nere  and herde al þyng
which þat þis ȝoman spak  for suspecion
Of mennes speche  euere had this chanon
ffor caton seith  he þat gilty is
Demeth al þing  of him be spoke ywis
  
By cause of that  he gan so nygh to drawe
his ȝoman  and herde al his sawe
And thus he seide  vn to his ȝoma tho
Hold now thy pees  and spek wordes no mo
ffor ȝif þou doost  þou shalt it de abye
Thou sclaundrest me here  in this companye
And eke discouerest þat þou shuldest hyde
ȝe quod oure hoost  tel on what so betyde
Of al his thretenyng  recche þe nat a myte
In feith quod he  no more I do but lyte
And whan this chanon  saugh it wolde not be
But þat his yoman  wolde telle his priuite
he fledde a wey  for verray sorwe and shame
A quod þe ȝoman  here shal rise a game
Al þat I can  anoon wol I telle
Syn he is goon  þe foule feend him quelle
ffor neuere here after  wol I with him mete  
ffor peny ne for pound  I the beheete
he that me brouȝte  first vnto þat game
Er þat he deye  sorwe haue he and shame
ffor it is ernest to me by my feith
That fele I wel  what so eny man seith
And ȝit for al my smert and al my greef
ffor al my sorwe  labour and mescheef
I couthe neuere  leue it in no wise
Now wolde god  my wit myght suffise
To tellen al  that longeth to that art

Syn þat my lord is goon  I wol not spare
Swich þing as I knowe  I wol declare  
With this chanon  dwelled haue I vij ȝere
And of his science  am I neuere þe nere
Al þat I hadde  haue I lost ther by
And god woot so haue many mo þan I
Ther I was wont to be right fressh and gay
Of clothing  and of good aray
Now may I were  an hose vpon myn heed
And where my colour  was bothe fressh and reed
Now is it wan  and of leden hewe
who so it vse  sore shal him rewe
And of my swynk  ȝit blered is myn ye
Lo which auauntage  it is to multiplye
That slidynge science  hath me maad so bare
That I haue no good  where þat euere I fare
And ȝit I am  endetted so ther by
Of gold þat I haue borwed trewely
That while I lyue  I shal it quite neuere
Lat euery man  be war by me  for euere
What maner man  that casteth him ther to
Ȝif he contynue  I holde his thrifte ydo
ffor so helpe me god  þerby shal he not wynne
But empte his purs  and make his wittes thynne
And whan he  þurgh his madnesse and folie
hath lost his owne good  þurgh Iupartie
Than he exciteth  other men therto
To lese her good  as him self hath do  
ffor vnto shrewes  ioye it is and ese
To haue her felawes  in peyne and disese
  
Thus was I ones lerned of a clerk
Of þat no charge  I wol speke of oure werk
 Whan we be þere  as we shul exercise
Oure eluyssh craft  we seme wonder wise
Oure termes be  so clergeal and so queynte
I blowe þe fire  til þat myn herte feynte
what shulde I telle  eche proporcion
Of thinges whiche  þat we worchen on
As of fyve or sixe vnces  it may wel be
Of siluer  or of som oþer quantite
And besie me  to telle ȝow the names
Of orpement brent bones  yren squames
That in to pouder  grounde be ful smal
And in an erthen pot  how it put is al
And salt yput in  and also papire
Bifore thise pouders  that I speke of here
And wel ycouered  with a lampe of glas
And of moche other thing  what that ther was
And of the pot and glas englutyng
That of the eyre  myght passe no thyng
And of the esy fire  and smart also
Whiche þat were made  and of the care and wo
That we had  in oure maters sublymynge
And amalgamynge  and calcenynge
Of quic siluer  ycleped mercurie crude
ffor alle oure sleightes we can not conclude
Oure orpement  and sublymed mercurie
Oure grounde litarge  eke on the porphirie
Of eche of þise  of vnces a certayn
Not helpeth vs  oure labour is in vayn
Ne eke oure spirites  ascensioun
Ne eke oure mater  that lyn al fixe adoun
May in oure werching  no thing vs avayle
ffor lost is al oure labour  and trauayle
And al the cost on twenty deuel way
Is lost also  which we vpon it lay
  
Ther is also  many another thing  
That is to oure craft  apertenyng
Though I by ordre hem here  ne reherse can
Be cause that I am  a lewed man
Ȝit wol I telle hem  as þei come to mynde
Though I ne can  sette hem in her kynde
As boole amoniak  verdegres boras
And sondry vesselles  made of erthe and glas
Oure vrinals  and oure descensories
Violes crescellettes  and sublymatories
Concurbites  and alembikes eke
And othere  dere ynogh a leke
Not nedeth it  to rehersen hem alle
Watres rubifiynge  and boles galle
Arsenyk  sal armoniak  and brymston
And herbes  coude I telle eek manyon
As egremoyne  valerian and lunarie
And other suche  ȝif þat me lust tarie
Oure lampes brennynge  bothe nyght and day
To bringe aboute  oure craft ȝif þat we may
Oure fourneis eke  of calcinacion
And of oure watres  albificacion
Vnslekked lyme  chalk  and gleyre of an ey
Poudres diuerse  asshes dong pisse and cley
Cered pokettes  sal petre and vitriole
And diuerse fires  made of wode and cole
Sal tartre  alcaly and salt preparat
And combust materes and coagulat
Cley made with horses  or mannes heer and oyle
Of tartre  alumglas  berme wort and argoyle
Reysalgar  and othere materes enbibynge
And eke of oure materes  encorporinge
And of oure siluer  citrinacion
Oure fermenting and fermentacion
Oure Ingottes  testes and many mo
I wol ȝow telle  as was me tauȝt also
  
The foure spirites  and the bodies seuene
By ordre as I haue herd  my lord neuene
The first spirit  quik siluer called is  
The secunde orpement  the thridde ywis
Sal armoniak  and the fourthe brymston
The bodies seuene  eek loo hem here anoon
Sol gold is  and luna siluer we threpe
Mars yren  Mecurie quik siluer we clepe
Saturnus leed  a Iupiter is tyn
And venus copir  by my fader kyn
This cursed craft  who so wol excercise
He shal no good han  that may suffise
ffor al the good  he spendeth ther aboute
he lese shal  therof haue I no doute
Who so that lust  to outen his folie
lat him come forth  and lerne multiplie
And euery man  þat hath auȝt in his cofre
lat him appere  and wexe a philosophre
Ascaunce that craft  is so light to lere
Nay nay god woot  al be he monk or frere
Preest or chanon  or eny other wight
Though he sitte at his book boþe day and nyght
In lernyng of this eluissh nyce lore
As is in veyne  and parde moche more
Is to lerne a lewed man  this sotilte
ffy spek not þerof  for it wol not be
Al coude he lettrure  or coude he noon
As in effecte  he shal fynde it al oon
ffor bothe two  by my saluacion
Concluden in multiplicacion
yliche wel  whan þei han al ydo
This is to say  þe fayle bothe two
Ȝit forȝat I to moche rehersaille
Of watres corosif  and of lymaille
And of bodies  mollificacion
And also  of her induracion
  
Oyles ablucion  and metal fusible
To tellen al  wolde passen eny bible
That ougher is  werfore  as for the beste
Of alle þise names  now wol I me reste
ffor as I trowe  I haue ȝow told ynogh
To reisen a feend  loke he neuere so rogh  
A nay lat be  thy philosophres stoon
Elixir cleped we  sechen faste echoon
ffor had we him  than were we siker ynow
But vnto god  of heuene I make a vow
ffor al oure craft  whan we haue al ydo
And al oure sleighte  he wol not come vs to
he hath vs made  spende moche good
ffor sorwe of which  almost wexe wood
But that good hope  crepeth in oure herte
Supposinge euere  thogh we sore smerte
To be releued  by him afterward
Supposing and hope  is sharp and hard
I warne ȝow wel  it is to seken euere
That future temps  hath made men disseuere
In trust ther of  from al þat euere þei hadde
ȝit of that art  þei coude not wexe sadde
ffor vn to hem  it is a bitter swete
So semeth it  for ne had þei but a shete
which þei myghte  wrappe hem in a nyght
And a bak to walken in  by day light
They wolde hem selle  and spenden on the craft
They can not stinte  til no thing be laft
And euere more  where þat euere þei goon
Men may hem knowe  by smel of brimstoon
ffor al the world  þei stynken as a goot
he sauour is  so rammyssh and so hoot
That though a man  from hem a myle be
The sauour wol infecten him trusteth me
Loo þus bi smellyng  and thred bare aray
Ȝif that men liste  this folk þei knowe may
  
And ȝif a man  wol aske hem priuely
Why þei be clothed  so vntriftily
Right anon þei wol  rownen in his ere
And sey  ȝif þei aspied were
Men wolde hem sleen  bicause of her science
Loo thus þis folk  betrayen innocence
Passe ouer þis  I go my tale vn to
Er þat þe pot  be on þe fire ydo
Of metalles · with a certeyn quantite
My lord hem tempreth  and no man but he  
Now he is gon  I dar say boldely
ffor as men sayn  he can do craftily
Algate I woot wel  he hath such a name
And ȝit ful ofte  he renneth in the blame
And wete how  ful ofte it happeth so
The pot tobreketh  and farewel al is go
Thise metals ben  of so greet violence
Oure walles may not  make hem resistence
Bu ȝif they be wrouȝt of lyme and stoon
They percen so  and thurgh the wal þei goon
And somme of hem  sinken in to the grounde
Thus haue we lost  be tymes many a pounde
And somme are scatered  al the floor aboute
Somme lepen in to þe roof  withoute doute
Though that þe feend  nat in oure sight him shewe
I trowe þat he  be with vs þat shrewe
In helle wher he is  lord and sire
Ne is ther no more wo  ne anger ne ire
 Whan that oure pot is broken  as I haue sayd
Euery men chit  and halt him euele payd
Somme seide it was long on the fire makyng
Somme seide nay  it was long on the blowyng
Than was I ferd  for þat was myn office
Strawe quod the thride  ȝe be lewed and nyce
It was not tempred  as it ouȝt be
Nay quod the ferthe  stinte and herkene me
  
By cause oure fire  was not made of beech
That is the cause  noon other so theech
I can not telle  wher on it is along
But wel I woot  greet strif is vs among
What quod my lord  ther is no more to done
Of thise periles  I wol be war eft sone
I am right siker  þat the pot was crased
Be as be may  be ȝe no thing amazed
As vsage is  lat swepe the floor as swithe
Plucke vp ȝowre herte  and be ȝe glad and blithe
The mollok on an heep  yswopen is
And on the flore  cast a canevas
And al this mollok  in sive ythrowe  
And sifted and yplucked  many a throwe
Parde quod oon  somwhat of oure metall
Yit is ther here  þogh we haue not all
And thogh this thing  mishapped hath now
Anoþer tyme  it may be wel ynow
Vs muste putte  oure good in auenture
A marchant parde  may nat ay endure
Trusteth me wel  in his prosperite
Somtyme his good  is drowned in þe see
And somtyme cometh it sauf  vnto the londe
Pees quod my lord  þe nexte tyme I wol fonde
To bringe oure craft  al in another plyte
And but I do sires  lat me haue the wyte
Ther was defaute  in somwhat wel I woot
And othere seide  the fire was ouerhoot
But be it hoot or coold  I dar wel say this
That we conclude  eueremore amis
We failen of that  which we wolde haue
And in oure madnesse  eueremore we raue
And whan we been  togeder euerychon
Euery man semeth  as wys as salomon
But al thing  which þat semeth golde
Is nat gold  as I haue herd tolde
  
Ne euery appel  that is fayre at eye
Ne is not good  what so men clappe or seye
Right so loo fareth it  amonges vs
He that semeth  the wisest by Ihesus
Is moost fool  whan it cometh to the preef
And he that semeth trewest  is þe moste þeef
That shull ye knowe  er þat I fro yow wende
By that I of my tale  haue made an ende
Ther is a Chanon  of Religioun
Amonges vs  wolde enfecte al a toun
Thogh it as greet ware  as was Niniue
Rome Alisaundre  Troye and other thre
His sleightes  and his infinite falsnesse
Ther cowthe no man  writen as I gesse
Thogh that he myghte  lyven a þousand yeer
In al this world  of falsnesse nis his peer  
ffor in his termes  he wol him so wynde
And speke his wordes  in so sligh a kynde
Whan he commune shal  with eny wight
What he wol make him  dote anon right
But it the feend be  as him self is
fful many a man  hath he begiled er this
And wole ȝif that he may  lyuen a while
And ȝit men riden  and goon ful many a myle
Him for to seke  and haue aqueyntance
Nought knowynge  of his fals gouernance
And ȝif ȝe lust  to ȝeue me audience
I wol it telle  here in ȝoure presence
But worschipeful Chanon  Religious
Ne demeth not  þat I sclaundre ȝoure hous
Al thogh my tale  of a chanon be
Of euery ordre  som shrewe is parde
And god forbede  that al a companye
Shulde rewe  a singuler mannes folie
To sclaundre ȝow  is not myn entent
But to correcten  þat is wis ywent
  
This tale was not oonly  told for ȝow
But eke for other mo  ȝe woot wel how
That amonges  cristes aposteles twelue
Ther was no traitour  but Iudas him selue
Than why sholde þe remenant  alle haue blame
That gilteles were  by ȝow sey I the same
Sauf only this  ȝif ȝe wole herkne me
Ȝif any Iudas  in ȝoure couent be
Remeweth him by tyme  I ȝow rede
Ȝif shame or losse  may causen any drede
And beth no þing displesed  I ȝow pray
But in this caas  herkeneth what I say
IN london was a preest  an aunueler
That þerynne dwelled  had many a ȝeer
which was so plesant  and so seruisable
Vn to the wyf  where he was at table
That she wolde suffre him  no þing for to paie
ffor bord noþer clothing wente he neuere so gaye
And spending siluer  hadde he right ynowȝ  
Therof no force  I wol procede as now
And telle forth my tale  of the Chanon
That broghte þis preest to confusion
 This false Chanon  com vpon a day
Vnto the prestes chambre  there he lay
Besechinge him  to lene him a certeyn
Of gold  and he wolde quit him ageyn
Leneth me a marc  quod he but dayes thre
And at my day  I wol it quite the
And ȝif so be  þou fynde me fals
Another day  hange me by the hals
This prest him toke  a marc and þat as swithe
And this Chanon  him thanked ofte sithe
And toke his leue  and wente forth his weye
And atte thridde day  brouȝte his moneye
And to the preest  he took þis gold ageyn
Therof þis preest  was glad and fayn
  
Certes quod he  no þing anoyeth me
To lene a man a noble  or two or þre
Or what thing were  in my possession
whan he so trewe is  of condicion
That in no wise  he breke wol his day
To swich a man  I can neuere say nay
What quod þis Chanon  shulde I be vntrewe
Nay that were þing  fallen al of newe
Truthe is a thing  that I wol euere kepe
Vn to the day  in which þat I shal crepe
In to my graue  and ellis god forbede
Beleeueth þis  as siker as the crede
God thanke I  and in good tyme be it sayd
That ther was neuere man ȝit euel appayd
ffor gold ne siluer  that he to me lente
Ne neuere falshede  in myn herte I mente
And sire quod he  now of my priuite
Syn ȝe so goodly  haue ben to me
And kythed to me  so gret gentilnesse
Somwhat to quiten with  ȝoure kyndenesse
I wol ȝow shewe  and ȝif ȝow lust to lere  
I shal it shewe  to ȝow anon right here
How I can worchen  in philosophie
Taketh good heede  ȝe schul wel seen at yȝe
That I wol done  a maystrie or I goo
Ȝee quod the preest  ȝee sire and wol ȝe so
Marie ther of  I pray ȝow hertely
At ȝoure commaundement sire trewely
Quod the Chanon  and ellis god forbede
Loo how þis theef  couthe his seruice bede
fful soth it is  þat such profred seruice
Stinketh  as witnessen thise olde wise
And that ful sone  I wol it verifie
In this Chanon that is  roote of al treccherie
That eueremore  delite hath and gladnesse
Suche feendly thouȝtes  in his herte empresse
  
How cristes peple  he may to mescheef bringe
God kepe vs  from his fals dissimulinge
What wiste this preest  with whom þat he delte
Ne of his harme comynge  no thing he felte
O sely preest  o sely Innocent
With couetise anoon  þou shalt be blent
O graceles  ful blynd is þi conceyt
No þing artow war  of the deceyt
Which that þis fox  shapen hath to the
His wily wrenches  þou mayst not flee
Wherfore to go  to the conclusion
That referreth  to þi confusion
Vnhappy man  anoon I wol me hie
To telle thyn vnwitte  and þi folie
And eke the falsnes  of þat other wrecche
As ferforth  as my connynge wol strecche
This Chanon was my lord  ȝe wolde wene
Sire ofte in feith  and by the heuene quene
It was a nother Chanon  and nouȝt he
That can an hundred fold more sotiltee
He hath betrayed folc many tyme
Of his falsnesse  it dulleth me to Ryme
Euere whan I speke of his falshede
ffor shame of him  my chekes wexe rede
Algates þei begonne  for to glowe  
ffor reednesse haue I now  right wel yknowe
In my visage  for fumes diuerse
Of metalles whiche  ȝe han herd me reherse
Consumed and wasted  han my reednesse
Now take heede of this  Chanons cursednesse
 Sire quod he to the preest  lat ȝoure man goon
ffor quicsiluer  that we it hadde anoon
And lat him bringe  vnces two or three
And whan he cometh  as faste shull ȝe see
A wonder þing  which ȝe say neuere ar this
Sire quod the preest  it shal be done ywis
  
He bad his seruant  fecchen him þis þing
And he al redy  was at his bidding
And wente him forth  and com anoon ageyn
with this quicsiluer  shortly for to seyn
And toke thise vnces thre  to the Chanoun
And he it leide  fayre and wel adoun
And bad the seruaunt  coles for to bringe
That he anoon  myghte go to his worchinge
The coles right anoon  were yfette
And this Chanon  toke out a crosselette
Of his bosome  and shewed it the preest
This Instrument quod he  which þat þou seest
Tak in thin hond  and put þi self þerynne
Of þis quic siluer an vnce  and here begynne
In the name of crist to wexe a philosophre
Ther ben ful fewe  whiche þat I wolde profre
To shewe hem thus moche  of my science
ffor ȝe shull see  here by experience
That þis quicsiluer  I wol mortefie
Right in ȝoure sight  anon withoute lie
And make it as good siluer  and as fyn
As ther is eny in ȝoure purs  or in myn
Or elliswhere  and make it malleable
And ellis hold me  fals and vnable
Amonges folc  euere to appere
I haue a powder here  þat coste me dere
Shal make al gold  for it is cause of all
My cunnynge  which that I ȝow shewe shall  
Voydeth ȝoure man  and lat him be þer oute
And shitte the dore  whiles we ben aboute
Oure priuete  that no man  vs espie

1whiles we werken  in this philosophie1
Al as he bad  fulfilled was in dede
This ilke seruaunt  anoon right out ȝede
And his mayster  shette the dore anoon
And to her labour  speedly they goon
  
This preest at this cursed chanons biddyng
Vpon the fire  anoon sette this thyng
And blewe þe fire  and besied him ful faste
And þis chanon  in to the crosselet caste
A powder not I wher of  that it was
Ymade  outher of chalk  or of glas
Or somwhat ellis  was not worth a flie
To blynde with þis preest  and bad him hie
The coles for to cowche  al aboue
The crosselet  for in tokene that I the loue
Quod this Chanon  thyn hondes two
Shull werke al þinge  which as shall be do
Grauntmercy quod the preest  and was ful glad
And couched coles  as the Chanon bad
And whiles he besy was  þis feendly wrecche
This fals Chanon  þe foule feend him fecche
Out of his bosome  took a bechen cole
In which ful sotilly  was maad an hole
And ther Inne put was  of siluer lymayle
An ounce  and stopped was withoute fayle
This hole with wex  to kepe the lymayle in
And vnderstondeth  þat þis false gin
Was not maad there but it was maad bifore
And oþere thinges  as I shall telle more
Here afterward  which þat he with him brouȝte
Ar he com there  to begile him he thouȝte
And so dide  or þey wente a twynne
Til he had torned him  coude he not blynne
It dulleth me  whan þat I of him speke
On his falshede I fayn wolde me awreke
Ȝif I wiste how  but he is here and there  
He is so variant  he abideth nowhere
But taketh heede  now sires for goddes loue
He toke his cole  of which I spak aboue
And in his hond  he bar it priuely
And whiles þe preest couched besily
  
The coles  as I tolde ȝow er this
This chanon seide  freend ȝe done amis
This is not couched  as it ouȝte be
But sone I shal  amenden it quod he
Now lat me medle with it  but a while
ffor of ȝow haue I pite  by seint Gile
Ȝe be right hoot  I see wel how ȝe swete
haue here a cloth  and wype awey the wete
And whiles þe preest  him wyped haas
This Chanon toke his cole  I shrewe his faas
And leyde it vpon  aboue the midward
Of the crosselet  and blewe wel afterward
Til that the coles  gonne faste brenne
Now ȝeue vs drynke  quod the Chanon thenne
As swithe  al shal be wel I vndertake
Sitte we doun  and lat vs mery make
And whan the Chanons  bechen cole
was brent  al þe lymayle out at þe hole
In to the crosselet  anoon fil adoun
And so it muste  nedes by resoun
Syn it so euene  aboue couched was
But therof wiste  no þing þe preest allas
He demede alle the coles lyche goode
ffor of the sleighte  no þing he vnderstoode
And whan þis Alkamystre  sagh his tyme
Riseth vp sire prest  and stondeth by me
And for I woot wel  Ingot haue ȝe noon
Goth walketh forth  and bring a chalk stoon
ffor I wol make it  of the same shappe
That is an Ingot  ȝif I may haue happe
And bringe with ȝow  a bolle or a panne
fful of water  and see shull ȝe thanne
How þat oure besynesse  shal happe and preue
And ȝit for ȝe shul haue  no misbileue  
Ne wrong conceyt of me  in ȝoure absence
I wol not ben  out of ȝoure presence
  
But go with ȝow  and come with ȝow ageyn
The chambre dore  shortly for to seyn
They opened and shette  and wente forth her weye
And forth with hem  þei caried the keye
And comen ageyn  withoute eny delay
What sholde I tarie  al þe longe day
He took þe chalk  and shoop it in the wise
Of an Ingot  as I shal ȝow deuise
I say he took out  of his owne sleue
A teyne of siluer  euele mote he cheue
which þat was  but an ounce of weighte
And taketh heede now  of þis cursed sleighte
he shoop his Ingot  in lengthe and brede
Of the teyne  withoute eny drede
So slighly  þat þe prest it not espide
And  his sleue  ageyn he gan it hide
And from þe fire  took vp þe matere
And in to the Ingot  it putte with mery chere
And in to the water vessel he it caste
whan þat him liste  and bad the preest as faste
loke what there is  put in thyn hand and grope
Thou shalt fynde there  siluer as I hope
what deuel of helle  shulde it ellis be
Shauyng of siluer  siluer is parde
he putte in his hond  and toke vp a teyne
Of siluer fyn  and glad euery veyne
 was þis preest  whan he sagh it was so
Goddes blessing  and his modres also
And alle halwes  haue ȝe sire Chanon
Seide the preest  and I her malison
But and ȝe vouchesauf to teche me
This noble craft  and þis sotilte
I wol be ȝoure in al þat euere I may
Quod the Chanon  ȝit wol I make assay
The secounde tyme  that ȝe may take hede
And ben expert of this  and in ȝoure nede
  
Another day  in myn absence  
This discipline  and þis crafty science
 Lat take anoþer ounce quod he tho
Of quik siluer  withoute wordes mo
And do therwith  as ȝe haue done er þis
With þat other  þat now siluer is
This preest him besieth  in al þat he can
To done as þis Chanon  þis cursed man
Commaundeth him  an faste blew þe fire
ffor to come to the effecte  of his desire
And this chanon  right in þe mene while
Al redy was  þis preest eft to begile
And for a countenance  in his hond he bar
An holgh stikke  take hede and be war
In þe ende of which  an ounce and no more
Of siluer lymayle  put was al bifore
As was his cole  and stopped with wax wel
ffor to kepe in  his lymayle euerydeel
And whiles þis preest was in his besynesse
This Chanon with his stikke  gan him dresse
To him anoon  and his pouder cast In
As he dide er  þe deuel out of his skyn
him torne  I pray to god  for his falshede
ffor he was euere fals  in word and dede
And with his stikke  aboue þe crossette
That was ordeined  with þat false gette
He stereth the coles  til relente gan
The wax ageyn the fire  as euery man
But it a fool be  woot wel and moot nede
And al that in the hole was  out ȝede
And in to the crosselet  hastely it fel
The preest supposed  no þing but wel
But besied him faste  and was wonder fayn
Supposinge noght but trouthe  sothe for to sayn
He was so glad  I can it not expresse
In no manere  his merthe and his gladnesse
  
And to the Chanon  he profred eft sone
Body and good  ȝe quod the Chanon sone
Thogh pouere I be  crafty þou shalt me fynde
I warne the  ȝit is ther more behynde  
Is ther ony coper  hereynne seide he
Ȝe sire quod the preest  I trowe ther be
Ellis go bye som  and þat asswithe
Now sire go forth þi way  and hythe
He wente his way  and with þis coper he cam
And this chanon  in hand it nam
And of þat coper  weyed out but an ounce
Al to symple is my tunge  to pronounce
his monstre  and his witte  þe doublenesse
Of this chanon  rote of cursednesse
He semede freendly  to hem that knewe him noght
But he was feendly  bothe in werk and thoght
It werieth me to telle  of his falsnesse
And natheles  ȝit wole I it expresse
To that entente  þat men may be war þer by
And for noon other cause trewely
He putte this ounce of coper  in þe crosselet
And on the fire  asswithe he hath it set
And caste in pouder  and made þe preest to blowe
And in his worching  for to stoupe lowe
As he dide erst  and al was but a iape
Right as him liste  þe preest he made his ape
And afterward  in to the Ingot he it caste
And in the panne  putte it atte laste
Of water  and in he putte his owne hand
And in his sleue  as ȝe bifore hand
herde me telle  he had a siluer teyne
he slighly toke it out þis cursed heyne
Vnwetinge þis preest of his false craft
And in the pannes botme  he hath it laft
And in the water rombleth to and fro
And wonder priuely  took it vp also
  
The coper teyne  not knowynge þis preest
And hidde it  and hente him by the breest
And to him spak  and thus seide in his game
Stoupeth a doun  by god ȝe be to blame
helpeth me now  as I dide ȝow whiler
Put in ȝoure hand  and loketh what is ther
This preest took vp  þis siluer teyne anoon  
And þan seide the chanon  lat vs goon
And thise thre teynes  whiche as we haue wroght
To som goldsmyth  to wete ȝif it be ouȝt
ffor by my faith  I nolde for myn hood
But ȝif þei were siluer fyn and good
And þat asswithe  preued shall it be

They wente and pitte þise teynes in assay
To fyr and hamer myȝte no man sey nay
But þei were as hem oghte be
This sottid preest  who was gladder þan he
Was neuere brid  gladder ageyn the day
Ne nightyngale  in þe seson of May
Was neuere noon  that liste better synge
Ne lady lustyer  in carolynge
And for to speke of Loue  and womanhede
Ne knyght in armes  to done an hardy dede
To stonde in grace  of his lady dere
Than hadde þis preest þis craft for to lere
And to þe Chanon  þus he spak and seide
ffor þe loue of god  þat for vs alle deyde
And as I may  deserue it vnto ȝow
What shal þis Receyt coste  telleth now
By oure lady quod the Chanon  it is dere
I warne ȝow forsothe  sauf I and a frere
In Engelond  ther can no man it make
No fors quod he  now sire for goddes sake
What shal I paye  telle me I þe pray
ywis quod he  it is ful dere I say
  
Sire at oo word  ȝif þat ȝe lest it haue
Ȝe shull paie fourty pound  so god me saue
And ne were the frendshipe  þat ȝe dide er this
To me  ȝe shulde paie more ywis
This preest þe somme  of fourty pound anoon
Of nobles fette  and toke hem euerychoon
To þis Chanon  for this ilke receyt
Al his worching was fraude and deceyt
Sire preest he seide  I kepe to haue no loos
Of my craft  for I wolde it were kept cloos
And as ȝe loue me  kepeth it secree
ffor and men knewe  al my sotilte
By god men wolde haue so greet envie
To me by cause  of my philosophie  
I shulde be ded  ther were noon oþer weye
God forbede quod þe preest what seyȝe
Ȝit had I leuere spenden al the good
which þat I haue  and elles wexe I wood
Than þat ȝe shulde  falle in such meschief
ffor ȝoure good wil  sire haue ȝe right good preef
Quod the Chanon  and sire fare wel graunt mercy
He wente his way  and neuere þe preest him sey
After þat day  and whan þis preest sholde
Maken assay  at such tyme as he wolde
Of þis Receyt fare wel it wolde not be
Loo þus byiaped  and bygiled was he
 Thus maketh he  his introduction
To bringe folk  to her destruction
Considereth sires  how þat in eche astate
Betwixe men and gold ther is debate
So ferforth  þat vnnethes is þer oon
This multiplying blendeth so many oon
That in good feith  I trowe þat it be
The cause grettest  of þis grete scarste
Thise philosophres  speken so mistily
In þis craft  þat men can not come þerby
  
ffor eny witte  þat men haue now a dayes
They may wel chitren  and ianglen as done iayes
And in her termes  sette lust and peyne
But to her purpos  shul thei neuere atteyne
A man may lightly lerne  ȝif he haue oght
To multiplie  and bringe his good to noght
Loo such a lucre  is in þis lusty game
A mannes merthe  it wol torne al to grame
And empten also  grete and heuy purses
And make folk  to purchace curses
Of hem þat han þer to  her good ylent
O fy for shame  þei þat haue be brent
Allas can þei not flee  þe fires hete
Ȝe þat it vsen  I rede that ȝe lete
Lest ȝe lesen al  for bet þan neuere is late
Neuere to thryue  were to long a date
Thogh ȝe prolle ay  ȝe shull it neuere fynde  
Ȝe ben as bolde  as is bayard the blynde
That blundreth forth  and perile casteth he noon
he is as bold  to renne ageyn a stoon
As for to go besides  in the weye
So fare ȝe  þat multiplie I seye
Ȝif þat oure eyen  can not seen aright
Loke þat ȝoure mynde  lakke noght his sight
ffor thogh ȝe loke  neuere so brode and stare
Ȝe shull not wynne  a myte in þat chaffare
But wasten al  þat ȝe may rappe and renne
Withdrawe the fire  lest it to faste brenne
Medleth no more  with þat art I mene
ffor ȝif ȝe done  ȝoure thrifte is goon ful clene
And as swithe  I wol ȝow telle here
what þat the philosophres  seyn in þis matere
Loo thus seith Arnold  of the newe toun
As his Rosarie  maketh mencioun
He seith right thus  without eny lye
Ther may no man  mercurie mortifie
  
But it be with  his brotheres knowelechyng
How þat he  which first seide this thyng
Of philosophres  fader was hermes
He seith how þat  the dragon douteles
Ne dyeth not  but ȝif he be slayn
With his brother  and þat is for to sayn
By the dragon  mercurie and noon other
He vnderstood  þat bremston were his brother
That out of sol  and luna were ydrawe
And þerfore seide he  take hede to my sawe
lat no man besie him  this art for to seche
But he  that the entencion and speche
Of philosophres  vnderstonde can
And ȝif he do  he is a lewed man
ffor þis science  and þis cunnynge quod he
Is of þe secre  of secrees parde
Also þer was a disciple of plato
That on a tyme  saide his maister to
As his book sonier  wol bere witnesse
And this was his demande  in sothfastnesse  
Tel me the name  of the priue stoon
And plato answerde  vn to him anoon
Tak the stoon  that titanos men name
which is þat quod he  Magnesia is þe same
His disciple seide  ȝe sire and is it thus
This is ignotum  per ignotius
What is magnesia  good sire I pray
It is a water  that is mad I say
Of elementes foure  quod plato
Tel me the Roche  goode sire quod he tho
Of that water  ȝif it be ȝoure wille
Nay nay quod plato  certeyn þat I nylle
The philosophres  were sworn ecchon
That þei shulde discouere it to no mon
Ne in no book  it write in no manere
ffor vn to god  it was so leef and dere
  
That he wol not  þat it discouered be
But where it liketh  to his deyte
Man to enspire  and eke for to defende
whom that him liketh  loo þis is þe ende
 Than conclude I thus  syn þat god of heuene
wol not  that the philosophres nevene
how that a man  shal come vn to þis stoon
I rede as for the beste  lat it goon
ffor who so maketh god his aduersarie
And for to worche eny thing in contrarie
Vn to his wil certes neuere shal he thryve
Thogh þat he multiplie  terme of his lyve
And there a poynt for ended is my tale
God sende euery trewe man bote of his bale
