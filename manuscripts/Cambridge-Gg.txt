Whan that Aprille  with his schoures swote
The drought of Marche  hath perced to þe rote
And bathed euery veyne  in suche licoure
Of whiche vertue  engendrid ys the floure
And ȝephirus eke  with his swete breth
Enspired hath  in euerie holt and heth
The tendre croppes  and the yong sonne
In to the Ram  his half cours ronne
And smale fowles  maken melodye
That slepen all the nyght  with open eye
So priketh hem nature  in here corages
Than longen folk  to gon in pilgrymages
And palmers for to seke  straunge strondes
To ferne halwes  couthe in sondry londes
And specialy  from euerie schires ende
Of Englond to Caunterburye thei wende
The holy blisfull martyr  for to seke
That hem hath holpen  whan þat þei were seke
Byfell that  in that sesoun on a daye
In suthwerk  at the Thabard as I laye
Redy to wenden  on my pilgrymage
To Caunterbury  with full deuoute corage
At nyght was come  in to þat hostelrye
Well nyne and twenty  in a companye
Of sondry folk  by auenture falle
In felschip  and pilgrymes were þei alle
That towarde Cauntirbury  wolde ryde



And well were esid  at the beste
And schortly  whan the sonne was to reste
So had I spoken  with hem euerychon
That I was  of here felaschip anon
And made forward  erly for to ryse
To take oure way  there as I you deuyse
But natheles  while I haue tyme and space
Or that I ferþer  in this tale pace
Me thynketh it acordaunt to resoun
To telle ȝow  al the conchusyoun
Of eche of hem as it semyth me
And whiche þey were and of what degre
And ek in what aray þat they were inne
And at a knyȝt þanne wele I ferst begynne
 A knyght þere was and that a worthy man
That from the tyme that he ferst began
To rydyn out he louede Chyualrye
Trouthe honour fredom and curteysie
fful worthi was he in hese lordis werre
And therto hadde he  redyn noman ferre
As wel in cristyndom as in hethnesse
And euere honoured for hese worthynesse
 At Alisandir he was whan it was wonne
And ofte tyme  he hadde þe bord begunne
Abouyn alle nacyounnys in Pruce
In lectowe hadde he reysed and in reuce
Non cristene man so ofte  of his degre
In gernage at þe sege ek hadde he be
Of Algazer and redyn in balmarye
At leyeys was he and at satalye
Whan they were wonne and in þe grete see
At manye a nobil aryue hadde he be
At mortal bataylis hadde he be fiftene
And  for oure feith at tramessene
In lystis thryis  and ay slayen his fo


This ilke worthi knyth hadde ben also
Sumtyme with þe lord of Palatye
Ageyn anothir hethen  in Turkye
And eueremor he hadde a souereyn prys
And thow that he were worthy he was wys
And of hese port as meke as is a mayde
He neuere ȝit non velany ne sayde
In al his lyȝf vn to no maner wight
He was a weray perfit gentil knyȝt
But for to telle ȝow of his aray  
Hese hors were goode  but he was not gay
Of fustien he werede a iopoun
Al besloteryd with hese habirioun
for he was late come from hese vyage
And wente for to don here pilgrymage
 With hym þere was  hese sone a ȝong squyer
A louere  and a lusty bacheleer
With lokkis crulle as þey were leyd in presse
Of twenty ȝer  of age he was I gesse
Of hese stature  he was of euene lenthe
And wonderly delyuere  and of gret strenthe
And he hadde ben sumtyme In chyuachie
In fflaunderis in artoys  and in pikardye
And boryn wel as of so litil spase
In hope to stondyn  in hese lady grace
Enbroudit was he  as it were a mede
Al ful of frossche flourys white and rede
Syngynge he was or floutynge al the day
He was as frosch as is the monyth of may
Schort was his gounne  with sleuys longe and wide
Wel coude he sitte on hors  and fayre ryde
He coude songis make  and fayre endite
Iuste and ek daunse  and wel portreye and wryte
So hote he louede þat be nyghter tale
He slepte no more than doth a nyghtyngale
Curteis he was loueli and seruysable


And karf beforn hese fadir at the table
 A ȝeman hadde he and seruauntys no moo
At that tyme  for he leste ryde soo
And he was clad in cote and hod of grene
A schef of pekok  arwys bryȝte and schene
Vndir his belte he bar ful thryftyly
Wel coude he dresse hese takil ȝemanly
Hese arwis droupede nought with federys lowe
And in his hand he bare a myghty bowe
A not hed hadde he  with a broun vesage  
Of wode craft wel coude he al þe usage
Vp on his arm he bar a gay braser
And by his side  a swerd and a bokeler
And on that oþer side a gay daggere
Harneysed wel  and schrap as poynt of spere
A Cristofere  on his brest of siluyr schene
An horn he bar þe baudryk was of grene
A foster was he sothli as I gesse
Ther was also a nunne a prieresse
 That of here smylyng was ful simple and coy
Here gretteste oth was but be seynt loy
And sche was clepid Madame Eglentyne
fful wel sche song  þe seruyse of deuyne
Entuned in here nose so semely
And french sche spak ful fayre and fetysely
As aftyr þe schole of stratforthe at the bowe
ffor french of parys was to here onknowe
 At mete wel Itauȝt  was sche with alle
Sche let no morsel  from here lyppis falle
Ne wette here fyngyr  in here sause depe
Wel couthe sche carye a morsel  and wel kepe
That no drope ne fel vp on here brest
In curteysie was set ful meche here lyst
Hire ouere lippe wipede sche so klene
That in hire coppe þer was  no ferthyng sene
Of gres  whan sche dronkyn  hadde her draught


fful semely aftyr here mete sche raught
And sekyrly sche was of gret disport
And ful plesynge and amyable of port
And peynede here to contyrfete chere
Of court and to been  estatly of manere
And to ben holde dygne of reuerence
But for to spekyn of here concience
Sche was so charytable and so pitous
Sche wolde wepe ȝif that sche seye a mous
Kauȝt in a trappe ȝif it were ded or bledde  
Of smale houndis hadde sche þat sche fedde
With rostid flesch or mylk or wastelbred
But sore wepte sche ȝif on of hem were ded
Or ȝif men smot it with a ȝerde smerte
And al was concience and tendere herte
 fful semely here wimpil pynched was
Here nose tretis here eyen greye as glas
Here mouth ful smal and þerto softe and red
But sekyrly  sche hadde a fayr forhed
It was almost a spanne brod I trowe
ffor hardily sche was not vndirgrowe
fful fetys was here cloke as I was war
Of smale corl aboute here arm sche bar
A peyre of bedis Igaudeit al with grene
And þeron heng a broche of gold so kene
On wich þere was wretyn a cround A
And aftyr Amor vincit omnia
 A nothir nonne with here hadde sche
 That was here chapelen and prestis thre
 A monk þere was a fayr for the maystrye
An out ridere þat louede uenerye
A manly man to ben an abbot able
fful manye a deynte hors hadde he in stable
And whan he rod men myȝte his brydil here
Gyngelyn in a whistelyng wynd als clere
And ek as loude as doth the chapel belle


There as this lord was kepere of the selle
The reule of seynt Maur  and of seynt benyght
Be cause that it was old and sumdel streyt
This ilke monk let olde thynge pace
And held aftyr the newe world the space
He ȝaf not of that tixt a pulled henne
That seith þat hunterys ben not holye menne
Ne that a monk whan he is rekeles
Is lykened to a fysch that is watyrles
This is to seyne a monk out of hese cloystre  
But tilke tixt held he not worth an oystere
And I seyde his opynyoun was good
What schulde he stodie and make hymseluyn wood
Vp on a bok in cloystere alwey to poure
Of swynkyn with hese hondis and laboure
As Austyn bit how schal þe world be servid
Let Austyn han his swynk to hym reservid
Therfore he was a prekasour aryȝt
Grehoudis he hadde as swift as foul in flyȝt
Of prekyng and huntynge for the hare
Was al hese lust for no cost wolde he spare
I sey hese sleuys  purfilid at the hand
With grys  and that the feyneste of a land
And for to festene his hod vndir his schyn
He hadde of gold Iwrouȝt a ful coryous pyn
A loue knot in the grettere ende þere was
His hed was ballyd that schon as ony glas
And ek hese face as he hadde ben enoynt
He was a lord ful fat and in good poynt
Hese eyen stepe and rollynge in hese hed
That stemyd as a furneys of a led
Hese botis souple  his hors in gret estat
Now serteynly he was a fayr prelat
He nas not pale as a forpynnede gost
A fat swan louede he best of ony rost
His palfray was as broun as is a berye


A frere þere was a wantoun and a merye
 A lymytour a ful solempne man
In alle the orderys foure is non that can
So mekil of daliauns and fayr langage
He hadde mad ful manye a maryage
Of ȝonge wemen at hese owene cost
On to his ordere he was a noble post
fful wel he louyd  and famyliar was he
With frankeleynys  oueral in his cuntre
And with worthi wemen of the toun  
ffor he hadde power of confessioun
As seide hym self more than a curat
ffor of hese ordere he was licencyat
fful swetli herde he confessioun
And plesaunt was hese absolucyoun
He was an esi man to ȝeue penaunce
There as he wiste to han a good petauns
Vnto pore orderis for to ȝeue
Is ygne that a man Is wel Ischreue
ffor ȝif he ȝaf he durste make auaunt
He wiste that a man was repentaunt
ffor manye a man so hard is of hese herte
He may not wepe though hym sore smerte
Therfore in stede of wepyng and preyeres
Men mote ȝeue siluer to the pore freres
 Hise tipet was ay farsed ful of knyuys
And pynnys for to ȝeuyn fayre wywes
And serteynli he hadde a merye throte
Wel couthe he synge and pleyen on a rote
Of ȝeddyngis he bar vttyrli the prys
His nekke whit was as the flour de lis
Therto he strong was as a chaumpioun
He knew the tauernys wel in euery toun
And eueryche osteler and tapstere
Bet than a laser or a bakystere
ffor vn to swich a worthi man as he


Acordith not as by his faculte
To haue with swiche sike men aqueyntaunce
It is not honest it may not auauce
ffor to dele with non swich parayle
But al with riche and selleris of vitayle
And oueral there profit schulde aryse
Curteys he was and louly of seruyse
Ther was no man now so vertywous
He was the beste begere in hese hous
    
ffor thow a wedewe hadde not a scho  
So plesaunt was his in principio
Ȝit wolde he haue a ferthyng er he wente
His purchas was wel betyr than hese rente
And rage he couthe as it were ryȝt a whelp
In louedayis there couthe he mekil help
ffor there he was not lik a cloysterer
With a thredbare kope as is a scholer
But he was lik a mystir or a pope
Of double worstede was hese semeli kope
Tha rounded as a belle  out of the presse
Sumwhat he lipsede for hese wantounnesse
To make hese engelisch swete vp on his tunge
And in hese harpynge whan that he hadde sunge
Hese eyȝyyn twynkeledyn in hese hed aryȝt
As don the sterrys  in the frosty nyght
This worthi limytour  was cleped hobert
A marchaunt was there with a forkede berd
In motle an heigh on horse he sat
Vp on his hed a flaunderich bemysch hat
Hese botis clospede ful fetusely
Hese resoun he spak ful plesauntly
Sounynge alwey the cres of hese wynnyng
He wolde the se  were kept for ony thyng
Betwixe myddilbourgh and orewelle


Wel couthe en eschaung schildis selle
This worthi man ful wel his wit besette
There wiste no man that he was in dette
So estatli was he of hese gouernaunce
With hese bargaynys and hese cheuysance
fforsothe he was a worthy man withal
But sothe to seyn I not how men hym cal
A clerk there was of oxsenforthe also
That vnto logyk hadde longe Igo
As lene was hese hors as is a rake
And he nas not  1rygh fat  I vndyrtake1
fful thredbare was hese ouereste courtepy  
    
ffor he hadde getyn hym ȝit no benefys
Ne was so wordely for to hauyn offys
ffor hym was lefere to haue at hese bedis hed
Twenty bokis Iclad in blak or red
Of Aristotle and his philosophie
þan robis ryche or fedele or gay sautrie
But al be þat he was a philisofre
þat hadde but lityl gold in cofre
But al þat he myȝte of hese frendis hente
On bokis and on lernynge he it spente
And besily gan for þe soulys preye
Of hem þat ȝaf hym wherwith to schole heye
Of stodie tok he most kep and most hede
Not a word spak he more þan was nede
And þat was seyd in forme and reuerence
And schort and quik and ful of hey sentence
Sounynge in moral uertu was hese speche
And gladly wolde he lerne and gladli teche
A seriaunt of the lawe bothe war and wys
That oftyn hadde ben at þe paruys
He was also ryche of excellence
Discret he was and of gret reuerence
He semede swich hese wordis were so wyse


Iustyse he was ful oftyn in asyse
Be patent and be pleyn commyssioun
ffor hese sience and for hese heye renoun
Of feis and robis hadde he manyon
So gret a purchasour was neuere nor
Al was fesymple to hym in effect
His purchase myȝte not ben enfect
Neuere so besy a man as he þere nas
And þat he semede besiere þan he was
In termys hadde he cas and domys alle
þat from the tyme of kyng welyam were falle
Therto he coude endite and make a thyng  
Ther coude no man pynche at hese writyng
And euery statut coude he pleyn be rote
He rod but homely in a medely cote
Gyrt with a seynt of silk with barrys smale
Of hese aray telle I no lengere tale
A frankeleyn was in hese cumpanye
Whit was hese berd as is þe daysie
Of complexioun he was sanguyn
Wel louede be þe morwe a soppe in wyn
To leuyn in delit was euere hese wone
ffor he was epicurus owene sone
That held opynyoun þat pleyn delyt
Was uery felicite parfyt
An housholdere and þat a gret was he
Seynt Ielion he was in that cuntre
Hese bred hese ale was alwey aftyr on
A betere enuynede man was nower non
Withoute bake mete was neuere his hous
Of fysch and flesch and þat so plentyuous
It snowede in his mouth of mete and drynk
Of alle deynteis that men coude þynk
Aftyr þe sundery sesenys of the ȝer
So chaungede he hese mete and hese soper
fful manye a fat perterych hadde he in mewe


And many a brem  and manye a luce in stewe
Wo was hese cook  but ȝif hese sauce were
Poynaunt and redy al hese geere
His table dormaunt in hese halle alwey
Stod redy keuered  al the longe day
At sessiounnys þere was he lord and syre
fful ofte tyme he was knght of the schyre
An Anlas and a gipser al of sylk
Heng at hese gyrdil whit as morwyn mylk
A schirreue hadde he ben and countour
Was nower swich a vanasour
An habirdaschere and a carpenter  
A webber a dyere and a taphiser
And þey were clothid alle in on lyuere
Of a ful solempne and a gret fraternyte
ffrorsch and newe here ger apikede was
Here knyues were chapid not with bras
But al with sylvir wrouȝt ful clene and wel
Here grerdelys and here pouchis euerydel
Wel semede eche of hem a fayr burgeys
To sittyn In a ȝilde halle on a deys
Euerych for the wisdam that he can
Was schaply for to ben an aldirman
ffor catel hade þey Inow and rente
And ek here wyuys wolde it wel assente
And ellis serteyn weryn þey to blame
It is ful fayr to be clepid madame
And gon to vigilis al before
And han a mental ryalliche Ibore
A cok hadde þey with hem for þe nonys
To boile the chekenys and the marye bonys
And poudir Marchaunt tard and galyngale
Wel coude he knowe a drauȝt of londen ale
He couth roste and sethe and boyle and frye
Makyn mortereus and wel bake a pye
But gret harm was it as it semede me


That on hese schene a mormal hadde he
ffor blankmanger þat made he at the beste
A schipman was þere wonynge fer be weste
ffor ouȝt I wot he was of dertemouthe
He rod up on a rouncy as he couthe
In a gounne of faldynge to the kne
A daggere hangynge on a lace hadde he
Aboute his nekke vndir his arm adoun
The hote somyr hadde mad his hew al broun
And serteynli he was a good felawe
fful manye a drauȝt of weyn hadde he Idrawe
ffrom burdeux ward whil that the chapman slep  
Of nyce consience tok he none kep
Ȝif that he fauȝt and hadde the heyere hand
Be watyr he sente hem hom by euery land
But of hese craft to rekene wel hese tydis
Hese stremys and hese daungerys hym besyde
His herberwe and hese mone his lodmyngage
There nas non swich from hul to cartage
Hardy he was and wys to vndirtake
With manye a tempest hadde his berd ben schake
He knew alle þe hauenys as þey were
ffro gotlond to the kape of fenystere
And euery Cryk in bretayne and in spayne
His barge clepid was de maudelayne
With vs þere was a doctour of phisik
In al þis world was ther non hym lik
To speke of phisik and of surgerye
ffor he was groundit in astronomye
Hepte hese pacient a ful gret del
In houres by his Magik naturel
Wel couthe he fortwnen the ascendent
Of hese ymagis  for hese pacient
He knew the cause of euery maladye
Were it hot or cold or moyst or dreye
And where þey engendere and of what humour


He was a veray parfyt praktysour
The cause Iknowe and of hese harm the rote
Anon he ȝaf the seke man hese bote
fful redy hadde he sese apotecaryis
To syndyn hym hese droggis and hese letewaryis
ffor eche of hem made oþere for to wynne
Here frenschepe was not newe to begynne
Wel knew he the olde exculapijs
And diascorides and ek Rufijs
Olde ypocras lylye and galien
Serapion Raȝis and Auycen
Auerois damascyen and constantyn  
Bernard and Gadefleun and gilbertyn
Of hese diete mesurable was he
ffor it was of non superfluyte
But of gret nuryschynge and digestible
His stody was wol lytyl in the bible
In sanguyn and in pers he clad was al
lynede with taffata and sendal
And ȝit he was but esy of dispence
He kepte that he wan in pestelence
ffor gold in phisik is a cardial
Therfore he louede gold in special
A good wif was there of beside bathe
But sche was sumdel def and þat was skathe
Of cloth makyng sche hade swich an hand
Sche passed hem of ypres and of gaunt
In al the parich wif was there non
That to the offerynge to fore her schulde gon
And ȝif þere dede serteyn so wroth was sche
That sche was out of alle charite
Here couercheis ful fyne were of ground
I durste swere þey weyedyn a pound
That on a sunday weryn vp on here hed

Bold was here face and fayr and red of hewe
Sche was a worthi woman al here lyue
Husbondis at cherche dore sche hadde fyue
Withoutyn oþere compayne in ȝouthe
But þerof nedith not to speke as nouthe
And thryes hadde sche ben at Ierusalem
Sche hadde passed manye a strong strem
At rome she hadde ben and at boloyne
In galis at seynt Iame and at coloyne
Sche couthe meche of wonderyng be þe weye
Gattoþed was sche sothly for to seye
Vpon an aumbelere ful esily sche sat  
Iwympeled wel and on here hed an hat
As brod as is a bokeler or a targe
A fotmental aboute here hepis large
And on here fet a peyre of sporys scharpe
In felauschepe wel coude sche lawe and carpe
Of remedijs of loue  sche knew per schaunce
ffor sche coude of that art  the olde daunse
A good man was there of religioun
And was a pore persoun of a toun
But riche he was of holy thouȝt and werk
He was also a lerned man a clerk
That cristis gospel trewely wolde teche
Hese parischiens deuoutly wolde he teche
Benyngne he was and wondyr delygent
And in aduersite ful pacient
And swich he was preuyd ofte sythis
fful loth were hym to cursyn for hese tythis
But rathere wolde he ȝeuyn out of doute
Vnto hese pore parschens aboute
Of hese offeryng and hese substauce
He couthe in lityl thyng han suffisiaunce
Wyd was hese parysch and housys fer asundir
But he ne lyfte not for reyn ne thondir
In seknesse nor in myschif to visite


The fertheste in hese parich meche and lite
Vp on hese fet and in hese hond a staf
This noble ensaumple to hese schep he ȝaf
That fyrst he wrouȝte and aftyrward he tauȝte
Out of the gospel he to wordis cauȝte
And this figure he addede þerto
That ȝif gold rustede what schal yryn do
That ȝif a pryst be foul on whom we truste
No wondyr ist lewede men to ruste
And schame it is ȝif a pryst take kep
A schetyn schepperde and a clene schep
Wel outhe a prest ensaumple for to ȝeue  
By hese clennesse how hese schep schulde leue
He sette not hese benefys to hyre
An let hese schep acumbrit in the myre
And ran to lundene vn to seynt poulys
To seke hym a chauntriye for soulys
Or with a broþerhed to be with holde
But dwelte at hom and kepte wel hese folde
So that þe wolf ne made it not myscarie
He was a schepherde and not a mersenarye
And þow he holy were and vertyuous
He was not to synful men dispitous
Ne of hese speche daungerous ne digne
But in hese techynge 3discreet and benygne3
To drawyn folk to heuyn be clennesse
Be good ensaumple this was hese besynesse
But ȝif it were ony persone obstynat
What so he were of hey or low estat
Hym wolde he snybbyn scharpli for the nonys
A bettyr pryst I trowe neuere non is
He waytid aftyr no pompe ne reuerence
Ne makid  a spisede concience
But cristis lore and hese apostill twelue
He taughte but fyrst he folwede it hym selue
With hym þere was a plowman that was hese broþer
That hadde led of donge manye a fodir
A trewe swynkere and a good was he
leuynge in pes and parfit charite
God louede he best with al hese hole herte
At alle tymys thow hym gamenede or smerte
And thanne his nyȝhebour riȝt as hym selue
He wolde throsche and þerto dyke and delue
ffor cristis sake for  euey pore wyght
Withoutyn hyre  ȝif it leye in his myȝt
Hese tythis payede he ful fayre and wel
Bothe of  propre swynk and his catel
In a tabbard he rod vp on a mere  
There was also a reue and a mellere
A somnour and a pardounner also
A maunsiple and myn self there were no mo
The meller was a strong carl for the nonys
ful big he was of braun and ek of bonys
That preuyd he wel for ouyr al þere he cam
At wrastelynge he wolde haue alwey the ram
He was schort schulderid brod and thikke knarre
Ther nas no dore that he wolde heue of harre
Oor breke it at a rennyng with hese hed
His berd as ony sowe or fox was red
And þerto brod as þow it were a spade
Vp on the cop ryȝt of hese nose he hade
A wrete and theron stod a tust of herys
Red as the brostelis of a sowys erys
Hese nosetherlis blake were and wide
A swerd and a bokeler bar he bi hese syde
His mouth as a gret furneys
He was a ganglere and a galiardeys
And that was most of synne and harlotrye
Wel coude he stele corn and tolle twye
And that he hadde a tabbard2 of good parte2
A whit cote and a blew hod werede he
A bagge pipe wel couthe he blowe and sounne


And þerwithal he brouȝte  vs out of tounne
A gentyl maunciple was þere of a temple
Of whiche acatouris myȝte take exsaumple
ffor to ben wys in beyinge of uytayle
ffor where that he payede or tok be tayle
Algate he waytide so in hese acate
That he was ay beforin and in good state
Now is not that of god  a ful fayr grace
That swich a lewede manys wit schal pace
The wisdam of an hep  of lernede men
Of maystrys hadde he mo þan thryis ten
That were of lawe expert and corious  
Of whiche þere were a doseyn in that hous
Worthi to ben styward of 2rente and lond2
Of ony lord that is in yngelond
To make hym lyue  by his owene good
In honour detteles but he werere wod
Or leue as skarsely as hym liste desire
And able for to helpyn al a schyre
In ony cas that myȝte falle or happe
And ȝit this maunsiple  sette here allerys cappe
The reue was a sclendere colerik man
Hese berd was schaue as nygh as euere he can
His her was by hese erys ful roude Ischorn
His top was dokkyd as a pryst beforn
fful longe were hese leggis and ful lene
ylik a staf ther was no calf Isene
Wel couthe he kepe a gerner and a bynne
There  non auditour couthe on hym wynne
Wel wiste he be þe droute and be the reyn
The ȝildynge of hese sed and of hese greyn
His lordis schep hese net hese deyerye
Hese swyn hese hors hese stoor and his pultrie
Was holly in þis revis gouernynge
And be þe couenaunt ȝaf the rekenynge
Syn þat his lord was twenty ȝer of age


The coude no man bryngyn hym in arerage
Ther nas bayle herde ne oþer hyne
That he knew his sleythe and conynge
The were adred of hym as of the deþ
Hese wonyng was ful fayre  vp on an heth
With grene treis Ischadewid was hese place
He couthe betere þan hese lord purchase
fful riche he was astorid preuyly
Hese lord wel couthe he plese subtily
To ȝeue and lene hym of hese owene good
And haue a thank and ȝit a cote and1 hood1
In ȝouthe he hadde lernyd a good mystir  
He was a wol good wryȝte a carpenter
This reue sat vp on a ful good stot
That was a pomeli grey and hyȝte skot
A long surcote of pers vp on he hadde
And bi hese syde he bar a rusty blade
Of norfolke was þis reue of whiche I telle
Be syde a toun men clepe baldiswelle
Tukkede he was as is a frere aboute
And euere he rod þe hemereste of oure route
A somnour was þere with vs in that plase
That hadde a fer red cherubynys face
ffor sausefleme he was with eyen narwe
As hot he was and lecherous as a sparwe
With skalede browys blake and pilid berd
Of hese vesage chylderyn weryn aferid
Ther nas quyk siluyr litarge ne bronston
Boras seruse ne oyle of tartre non
Ne oynement þat wolde clense and byte
That hym myȝte helpyn of hese whelkys white
Ne of the knobbis sittynge on hese schekes
Wel louede he garlek onyounnys and ek lekys
And for to drynkyn strong wyn red as blod
Thanne wolde he speke and crye as he were wod
And whan he wel dronkyn hadde þe wyn


Thanne wolde he speke no word but latyn
A fewe termys hadde he to or thre
That he hadde lernyd out of sum decre
No wondir he herde it al the day
And ek ȝe knowe wel that a Iay
Kan clepe watte as wel as can the pope
But who so couthe in oþere þyngis hym grope
Thanne hadde he spent al hese philosophie
Ay questio quod Iurys wolde he crye
He was a gentil harlot and a kynde
A betere felawe schulde men not fynnde
He wolde suffere for a quart of wyn  
A good felawe to haue hese concubyn
A twelmonyth and excusyn hym at the fulle
fful pryuyly a fync ek couthe he pulle
And ȝif he fond ower a good felawe
He wolde techyn hym to haue non awe
In swich cas of the erchedekenys curs
But ȝif a manys soule were in hese pors
ffor in hese purs he schulde ponyschid be
Purs is the erchedekynys helle seyde he
But wel I wot he lyeþ ryȝt in dede
Of cursyng owyth eche gilty man drede
ffor curs wele sle ryȝt as asoylyng sauyth
And also war hym of a sygnyficauyth
In daunger hadde he at hese owene gyse
The ȝonge gerlys of the diosyse
And knew here conseyl and was al here red
A garlond hade he set vp on hese hed
As gret as it were for an ale stake
A bokeler hadde he mad hym of a cake
With hym there rod a Ioly pardounner
Of rouncyuale his frend and his cumper
That streyt was comyn from the court of rome
fful loude he song loue come hedir come
This somnour bar to hym a stif bordoun


Was neuere triompe half of so gret a soun
This pardounner hade her as ȝelw as ony wax
But smothe it heng as doþ a strik of flex
Be ouncis heng hese lokkys þat he hadde
And þerwith he hese schulderys ouerspradde
But thenne it lay be culpounnys on and on
And hod for Iolite werede he non
ffor it was trussed vp in hese walet
Hym thouȝte he rod al of the newe iet
Discheuele saf his cappe he rod al bare
Sweche glarynge eyen hadde he as an hare
A vernykele hadde he sowyd vp on hese cappe  
Hese walet beforyn hym in hese lappe
Bret ful of pardoun come from rome hot
A uoys he hath as smal as haþ a got
No berd hadde he ne neuere schulde haue
As smothe it was  as it were late schaue
I trowe he were a geldyns or a mare
But of hese craft from berewik in to ware
Ne was swich a noþer pardounnere
ffor in his male he hadde a pilwe bere
Wich þat he seyde was oure lady ueyl
He seyde he hadde a gobet of þe seyl
That seynt petyr hadde whan þat he wente
Vp on þe se tyl that god hym hente
He hadde a cros  of latoun  ful of stonys
And in a glas he hadde piggis bonys
But with þese relikys whan þat he fond
A pouere persoun vp on lond
Vp on a day he gat hym more moneye
Than þe persoun gat in moneþis tweye
And þus with feynede flaterye and Iapis
He made the persoun and the puple hese apys
But trewely to tellyn at the laste
He was in cherche a noble ecclesiaste
Wel couthe he rede a lessoun or a story


But aldirbest he song an offratory
ffor wel he wiste whan that song was sunge
He muste preche and wel affile hyse tunge
To wynne syluer as he wel couthe
Therfore he song the meryerely and loude
Now haue I told ȝow sothly in a clause
The estat tharay the noumbre and ek the cause
Whi assemblid was this cumpayny
In southwerk at this ientil ostelry
That hyȝte the tabbard faste by þe belle
But now is tyme to ȝow for to telle
How that we beryn vs that ilke nyȝt  
Whan that we were in that ostelrye alyȝt
And aftyr wole I telle of oure viage
And al the remenaunt of oure pilgrymage
But fyrst I prey ȝow of ȝoure curteysye
That ȝe narette not myn velanye
Thow that I pleynly speke in þis matere
To telle ȝow here wordys and here cher
Ne thow I speke here wordis properly
ffor this ȝe knowyn als so wel as i
Who so schal telle a tale aftyr a man
He mote reherse as nyh as euere he can
Eueryche a word ȝif it be in his charge
Al speke he neuere so rewedely and large
Or elle he mote telle his tale ontrewe
Or feyne þyng or fyndyn wordis newe
He may not spare althey he wer his broþer
He mote as wel seyn on word as a noþer
Crist spak hym self ful brode in holy wryt
And wel ȝe wote no velany is it
Ek plato seyth ho so can hym rede
The wordys
Also I preye ȝow to forȝeue it me
Al haue I not set folk in here degre
Here in this tale al as þey schulde stonde


Myn wit is schort ȝe may wel vndyrstonde
Gret chere mad oure ost vs euerychon
And to the soper sette he vs anon
He seruede vs with vitayle at the beste
Strong was the wyn and wel to drynke vs liste
A semely man oure ost was with al
ffor to ben a marchal of an hal
A large man he was with eyne stepe
A fayrere burgeys is þere non in chepe
Bold of hese speche and wis and wel Itauȝt
And of manhod hym lakkede ryȝt noȝt
Eke therto he was right a mery man  
And aftir soper pleyn he bygan
And spak of mirthe among and othere thingis
Whanne that he hadde mad oure rykenynges
And seide thus now lordyngis trewly
Ye ben to me welcome ryght hertily
ffor certis yf that I shal not lye
I sawe nought this yere so mery a companye
At ones in this herborowe as it now
ffayn wolde I don you myrthe wiste I how
And of a myrthe I am right now bithought
To don yow ese and it shal coste nought
Ye gon to Caunterbery god yow spede
The blisfull martir quyte you youre mede
And wel I wote as ye gon by the weye
Ye schapen yow to talen and to pleye
ffor truly comfort ne mirthe is noon
To riden by the weye doumbe as a stoon
And therfore wole y maken you disport
As I seide arst and don yow som comfort 
And if yow liketh alle by oon assent
fforto stonden att my Iuggement
And forto werken as I shal yow seye
To morowe whanne ye riden by the weye
Now so god saue me at my most nede


But ye be merie I wole yeue yow myn heede
Holde up youre hondis withoute more speche
Oure councel was not long forto seche
Vs thought it was not worth to make to wys
And grauntide hym withouten more avys
And bade hym seie his verdoit as hym liste
Lordlyngis quod he herkeneth now for the beste
But take it nought  I praie ȝow in disdeigne
This is the poynt to speke short and pleigne
That eche of yow to short with oure weye
In this viage shal telle tales tweye
To caunterbury ward I mene it so
And homward he shal tellen other two
Of auentoures that haue bifalle
And which of yow that berith him best of alle
That is to seyn that tellith in this cas
Tales of best sentence and moost solas
Shal haue a souper at oure aldercost
Here in this place sittynge bi this post
Whanne that we comen ageyn fro Cauntirbury
And forto make yow the more myry
I wole my siluen goodly with ȝou ride
Right at myn owne caste and be youre gyde
And who so wole my iugement withseye
Shal paye al that we spende by the weye
And if ye vouche saaf that it be so
Telle me anoon without ony word moo
And I wole erly shape me therfore
This thing was graunted and oure othes swore
With ful glad herte and preien him also
That he wolde vouche saaf forto do soo
And that he wolde be oure gouernour
And of oure tales Iugge and reportour
And sette a soper  at a certeyn prys
And we wolen reuled ben at youre deuys
In high and logh and thus by oon assent


We ben acordid to the Iuggement
And theruppon the wyn was fet anoon
We dronken and to rest wente echon
Withouten ony lenger  tariyng
A morow whanne the day gan to springe
Vp roos oure oost and was oure alde cok
And gaderede us to gidre in a flok
And forth we riden a litil more than pas
Onto the watering of seynt Thomas
And there oure oost gan his hors areste
And seide lordis herkeneth if yow leste
Ye wote youre forward and I it yow recorde  
If euensong and morowe song accorde
Let se now who shal telle the firste tale
As euere mote I drynke wyn or ale
Who so rebelle to my Iuggement
Shal paye for all that by the weye is spent
Now drawith Cutt er that ye ferther twynne
Which that hath the shortest shal bigynne
Sir knyght quod he my maister and my lord
Now drawith Cutt for that is accord
Cometh nere quod he my lady prioresse
And ye Sir clerk lat be youre shamfastnesse
Ne studieth noght leye hond to euery man
Anoon to drawe euery wight bigan
And shortly forto tellen as it was
Were it by auenture or by sort or cas
The sothe is the Cutt fel to the knyght
Of which ful blythe and glad was euery wight
And tellen he most his tale as it was resoun
By forward and by composicioun
As ye han herd what nedith wordes moo
And whanne this gode man sawe that it was soo
As he that wys was and obedient
To kepen his forward by his fre assent
He seide sithen I shal bigynne the game


What welcome be the Cut a goddis name
Now lat us ride and herkneth what I seie
And with that word we riden forth oure weye
And he bigan with riȝt a mery chere
His tale anoon and seide as ye may heere
WHylom as olde stories tellen vs
Ther was a Duk that hight Thesius
Of Athenes he was lord and gouernour
And in his tyme sich a conquerour
That gretter was noon vndir the sonne
fful many a riche Contre hadde he wonne
What with his wisdom and his Chiualrie
He conqueride al the regne of femyny
The whylom was clepid sithia
And weddide the queene ypolita
And brought hir hom with hym in his Contre
With mich glorie and gret solempnyte
And eke hir yonge sister Emelye
And thus with victory and with melodie
Lat I this noble Duk to Athenes ride
And al his oost in armes hym biside
And certis if it ne were to longe to heere
I wolde haue told fully the manere
How wymmen was the regne of femynye
By Theseus and by his chyualrie
And of the gret batayle for the nones
Bitwixen athenes and Amaȝones
And how assegid was ypolita
The fair  hardi queene of scithia
And of the feeste that was at hir wedding
And of the     at hir  home comyng
But al that hing I moot as now forbere
I haue god woot a large feld to ere
And weyk ben the oxen in my plough
The remenaunt of the tale is long ynough
I wole not letten eke noon of this Route


Lat euery felowe telle his tale aboute
And lat se now who shal the soper wynne
And ther as I left I wole bygynne
 This Duk of whom I make mecioun
Whanne he was comen almost to the town
In al his wele and his moost pride  
He was ware as he caste eyȝe aside
Where that ther knelide in the high weye
A company of ladies tweye and tweye
Ech aftir other cladde inchothes blake
But sich a crie and sich a woo they make
That in this world is creature lyuynge
That herde sich another weymentyng
And of this crie thei nolde neuere stente
Tyl they the reynes of his bridel hente
What folk be ye that at myn hom comynge
Disturblen so my feeste with criynge
Quod Theseus haue ȝe so gret enuye
Of myn honour that thus compleyne and crie
Or who hath yow mysboden or offendid
And telleth me if it may be amendid
And whi that ye ben clothed thus in blak
The eldest lady of hem alle spak
Whanne she hadde swouned with a deedly chere
That it was reuthe forto seen and here
She seide lord to whom fortune hath ȝyuen
Victorie and as a conquerour to lyuen
Not greueth vs youre glorie and youre honour
But we biseke mercy and socour
Haue mercy on oure wo and oure distresse
Sum drope of pite thorough thi gentilnesse
Vppon vs wrecchid wymmen lat yow falle
ffor certis lord ther is noon of vs alle
That she nath ben a duchesse or a quene
Now be we caytifs as it is wel sene
Thanked be fortune and hir fals wheel


That noon estat ensureth forto ben wel
Now certis lord to abide youre presence
Heere in this temple of the goddess clemence
We haue be waytyng al this fourtenyght
Helpe vs lord sith it is in thy myght
 I wrecche which that wepe and weyle thus  
Was whylom wif of kyng cappaneus
That starf at thebes cursid be that day
And all we that ben in this array
And maken all this lementacioun
We losten all oure hosbondis at that toun
While þat the assege there abowte lay
And yet now the olde Creon weiloway
That lord is now of thebes citee
ffulfillid with ire and of iniquitee
He for despite and for his tyrannye
To don the dede bodies velonye
Of alle oure lordes which that ben slawe
Hath all the bodies on a hepe Idrawe
And wole not suffre hem by non assent
Neither to ben Iburied neither Ibrent
But makith houndis ete hem in dispite
And with that word with outen more respite
Thei fyllen gruf and crieden pitously
Haue on vs wrecchid wymmen sum mercy
And lat oure sorowe synken in thyne herte
 This gentil duke from his Coursour he sterte
With herte pitous whanne he herde hem speke
Hym thoughte that his hert wold breke
Whanne he sawe hem so pitee and so mate
That whilom were of so grete astate
And in his armes he hem vp hente
And hem counfortith in ful good entente
And swoor his oothe as he was trewe knyght 
He wole don so ferforthly his myght
Vppon the treaunt Creon hem to wreke


That alle the puple of grece shold speke
How creon was of thebeus yserued
As he that hath his deth ful wel disserued
And ryȝt anon withoute more abod  
Hese baner he displayeþ and forth rod
To thebesward and al hese ost by hese side
No ner athenys wolde he go ne ryde
Ne take hese ese fully half a day
But onward on hese way þat nyȝt he lay
And sente anon Ipolita the quene
And emelie here ȝynge systyr schene
Vn to the toun of Athenys to dwelle
And forth he rit ther is no more to telle
The rede statue of mars with spere and targe
So schynyth in hese white baner large
That alle the feldis glederyn vp and doun
And bi hese baner is born hese penoun
Of gold ful ryche in whiche þere was Ibete
The mynatour whiche þat he slow in Crete
Thus ryȝt þis deuk þus ryȝt þis conquerour
And in his cost of cheualrie the flour
Til that he come to thebes and aligthe
ffayre in a feld there he thoute to fyghte
But schortli for to spekyn of this thyng
Witht Creon which that was of thebes kyng
He faught and slow hym manly as a knyght
In pleyn batayle and putte the folk to fleyȝ
And by assent he wan the sete aftyr
And rent adoun bothe wal and spere and raftyr
And to þe ladyis he restorede ageyn
The bonys of here frendis þat were slayn
To don obsequies as was þo the gyse
But it were al to longe for to deuyse
The grete clamour and the waymentyng
That þe ladyis made at the brennyng
Of the bodyis and the grete honour


That theseus the noble conquerour
Doth to þe ladijs whan þey from hym weynte
But schortely for to telle is myn entente
Whan that this worthi duk this thesius  
Hath Creon slayn and wonne thebes thus
Stille in that feld he tok al nyȝt hese reste
And dede with al the cuntre as hym leste
To ransake in the taas of bedijs dede
Hem for to strepe of harneys and of wede
The pilouris dydyn besynesse and cure
Aftyr the batayle and discumfiture
And so bifel that in the taas was founde
Thorgh girt with manye a blody wounde
Two ȝonge knyȝtys liggynge by and by
Bothe in on armys wrouȝt ful richely
Of whiche too Arcita hyȝte þat on
And that oþer knyȝt hyȝte palomoun
Not fully queke ne fully dede þey were
But by here cote armoure and by here gere
Theroudis knew hem best in special
As þey þat were of the blod ryal
Of Thebes and of systeryn to Iborn
Out of the taas the pilouris han hem torn
And han hem caryed softe on to the tente
Of thesyus and ful sone hem sente
To Athenes to dwellyn in presoun
Perpetually he nolde no raunsom
And whan this worthi deuk haþ þus Idon
He tok hese Ost and hom he rit anon
With laurer crouned as a conquerour
And there he lyuyth in ioye and in honour
Terme of lyf what nediþ wordis mo
And in a tour in angwisch and in wo
This Palamoun and hese felawe Arcite
ffor eueremor ther may mo gold hem quyte
This passeth ȝer be ȝer and day be day


Til it fel onys in a monyth of may
That emale that fayrere was to sene
Than is the lylie vp on hese stalke grene
And frosscher than þe may with flourys newe  
ffor with the rose colour frosch here hewe
I not whiche was fynere of hem too
Er it were day as was here wone to do
Sche was aresin and al redy dyȝt
ffor may wele haue no slogardye on nyȝt
The sesyn prekyth euery gentyl herte
And makyth it out of hese slep to sterte
And seyth arys and do þyn obseruaunce
This makith emalie to haue remembraunce
To don honure to may and for to ryse
Icloþed was sche fresch for to deuyse
Here ȝelwe her was broyded in a tresse
Be hynde here bak a ȝerde long I gesse
And in the gardyn at the sunne vpriste
Sche walkyth vp and doun and as here lyst
Sche gaderith flouris party white and rede
To make a suptyl garlond for here hede
And as an aungel heueneliche sche song
The grete tour that was so thikke and strong
Whiche of the castel was the chef donioun
There as the knyȝtis weryn In presoun
Of whiche I tolde ȝow and telle schal
As euene ioynande to the castel wal
There as this emale hadde here pleying
Bryȝt was the sunne and cler in that morwenyng
And palamoun þis woful presoner
As was hese wone be leue of hese gayler
Was resyn and romede in a chaubre an hey
In whiche he al the cete sey
And ek the gardyn ful of braunchis grene
There as this frosche Emelye the schene
Was in here walk and romede vp and doun


This sorweful louere this palamoun

And to hymselue compleynynge of hese wo
That I was born ful ofte he seyde allas  
And so befel be auenture and cas
That þorow a wyndowe thikke of manye a barre
Of yryn gret and squere as ony sparre
He caste his eye vp on emelyea
And þerwithal he blenthe and cryede A
As thow he stongyn were to þe herte
And with þat cry anon arcite vp styrte
And seyde cosyn myn what eylith þe
That art so pale and dedly on to se
Whi cryestow who hath the don offense

Oure prysoun for it may non oþer be

Sum wekede aspect or disposicioun
Of saturne by sum constolacioun
Hath ȝouyn vs þis alþow we hadde it sworn
So stod the heuene whan that we were born
We muste endure it þis is the schorte and pleyn
This Palamoun onswerde and seyde ageyn
Cosyn for sothe of this opynyoun

This prisoun causede me not for to crye
But I was hort ryȝt now thorghout myn ye
Into myn herte that wele myn bane be
The fayrenesse of myn lady þat I se
Ȝond in the gardyn romyn to and fro
Is cause of al myn cryinge and myn wo
I ne wot wheþer sche be woman or godesse
But venus it is sothly as I gesse
And þerwithal on kneis doun he fel
And seyde Venus ȝif it be þyn wil
Ȝow in this gardyn thus to transfigure


Befor me sorweful wreche cryature
Out of this prysoun help þat we may skape
And ȝif so be myn destene be schape
By eterne world to deyen in presoun  
Of oure kynrede haue sum compassioun
That is so lowe brouȝt be tyranye
And with that word Arcite gan asspie
Where as this lady romede to and fro
And with that syȝt here beute hurte hym so
That ȝif þat Palamoun was woundede sore
Arcite is hurt as wel as he or more
And with a sik he seyde pitously
The frossche beute sloth me sodeynly
Of here that romyth in the ȝondir plase
And but I haue here mersy and here grase
That I may sen here at the leste weye
I nam but ded þere nys no more to seye
This Palamoun whan he þo wordis herde
Dispitousli he lokede and answerde
Wheþer seyst þou this in ernest or in pley
Nay quod arcyte in ernest be myn fey
God help me so me lyst but euel pleye
This palamoun gan knytte hese browis tweye
It were to the quod he no gret honour
ffor to be fals ne for to be traytour
To me that am thyn cosyn and thyn brothir
Isworn ful depe and eche of vs to oþer
That neuere for to deyin in peyne
Til that the deth departe schal vs tweyne
Neyþer of vs in loue to hynderyn oþer
Ne in non oþer cas myn leue broþer
But þat þou schuldist trewely forþere me
In euery cas and I schal forthere the
This was þyn oth and myn also serteyn
I wote it wel þou darist it not withseyn
Thus art þou of myn conseyl out of doute


And now þou woldist falsely ben aboute
To loue myn lady whom I loue and serue
And euere schal tyl that myn herte sterue
Now certis false arcite þou schat not so  
I louede here fyrst and tolde þe myn wo
As to myn conseyl and to myn brþer sworn
To forthere me as I haue told beforn
ffor which þou art boundyn as a knyȝt
To helpyn me ȝif it leye in þy myȝt
Or elle art þou fals I dare wel seyn
This arcite ful proudely spak ageyn
Þou schat quod he be raþere fals than I
But þou art fals I telle þe vttyrly
ffor paramour I louede here ferst er þou
What wit þou seyn þou wyst no ȝit now
Wheþer sche be a woman or goddesse
Thyn is affeccioun of holynesse
And myn is loue as to creature
ffor whiche I telle þe myn auenture
As to myn cosyn and myn broþer sworn
I pose that þou louedist here beforn
Wist þou not wel the olde clerkys sawe
That ho schal ȝeue a louere ony lawe
Loue is a grettere lawe be myn pan
Than may ben ȝouyn to ony erthely man
And þerfore posityf lawe and swich decree
Is brokyn alday for loue in eche degree
A man mote nedis loue maugre in hese hed
He may not flen þat þogh he schulde be ded
Al be sche mayde or wedew or elle wif
And it is not likly al thyn lyf
To stondyn in here grace no more schal I
ffarewel þou wist þyn seluyn verayly
That þou and I ben dampned to presoun
Perpetuelly vs geynyth no raunsun
We stryue as dede the houndis for the bon


They fouȝte al day and ȝit here part was non
Ther cam a kete whil that þey were wrothe
That bar awoy the bon betwixe hem bothe
And þerfore at the kyngis court myn broþer  
Eche man for hym self ther is non oþer
Loue ȝif the lyst for I loue and ay schal
And sothli leue broþer this is al
Here in this presoun mote we endure
And euerych of vs take his auenture
Gret was the stryf and long betwixe hem tweye
Ȝif that I hadde leyser for to seye
But to þe effect it happede on a day
To telle it ȝow as schortly as I may
A worthi deuk that hyȝte perotheus
That felawe was vn to deuk Theseu
Syn thilke day þat þey were childeryn lite
Was come to athenes hese falawe to visite
And for to pleye as he was wone to do
ffor in this world he louede no man so
And he louede hym as tendirly ageyn
So wel þey louedyn as olde bokys seyn
That whan that on was ded sothly to telle
His felawe wente and souȝte hym doun in helle
But of that story liste me not to wryte
Deuk Perotheus louede wel arcite
And hadde hym knowyn at thebes þer be ȝere
And fynelli at requist and at preyere
Of perotheus withoutyn ony raunsoun
Deuk Theseus hym let out of presoun
ffreli to gon whil that hym leste ouyral
In swich agyse as I ȝow telle shal
This was the forward pleynly for tendit
Betwixe Thesius and hym Arcite
That it were that Arcite were founde
Euere in his lyf be day or nyȝt or stounde
In ony cuntre of this thesyus


And hee were cauth it was acordit þus
That with a swerd he wolde lese his hed
Ther nas non oþer remedie ne red
But takyth his leue and homward he hym spedde  
let hym be war his nekke lith to wedde
How gret a sorwe sufferith now arcyte
The deth he felyth thorgh his herte smyte
He wepith weyleth cryeþ pitously
To slen hym self he waytyth priuyly
He seyde allas that day that I was bore
Now is myn prisoun werse þan before
Now is me schapyn eternally to dwelle
Not in purgatory but in helle
Allas that euere knew I perotheus
ffor elle hadde I dwellid with thesyus
Ifetered in his prisoun euere mo
Thanne hadde I ben in blysse and not in wo
Only the syȝthe of her whom that I serue
Though I neuere here grace may disserue
Wolde han suffysed ryȝt Inow for me
O dere cosyn palamoun quod he
This is the victorie of this auenture
fful blysful in prisoun mayst þow endure
In prysoun nay parde but in paradys
Wel hath fortune Iturnede the deys
That hast the syȝt of here and I the absens
ffor possible is syn þow hast here presens
And art a knyȝt a worthi and able
That by sum cas syn fortune is chaungable
Thow mayȝt to þyn desyr sumtyme atteyne
But I that am exiled and barayne
Of alle grace and in so gret dispeyr
That þere nys erthe watyr fyre ne eyr
Ne criatur that of hem makyd is
That may me helpyn or don comfort in this
Wel ouȝte I sterue in wanhope and distresse


ffarwel myn lyf myn lust and myn gladnesse
Allas whi pleyne men so in comune
On puruyaunce of god or of fortune
That ȝeuyth hem ful ofte in manye a gyse  
Wel betyr þan þey can hem self deuyse
Sum man desiryth for to haue richesse
That is cause of hese mordere or gret seknesse
And some wolde out of hese presoun fayn
That in hese hous is of hese meyne slayn
Infynyte harmys ben in this matere
We wote not what þyng þat we preyen here
We farn as he þat dronke is as a mous
A dronke man wot wel that he hath an hous
But he not whiche the ryȝte weye is þedyr
And to a dronke man the weye is sledyr
And sertys in þis world so faryn we
We sekyn faste aftyr felycite
But we gon wrong oftyn trewely
Thus may we seyn alle and namely I
That wende and hadde a gret opynyoun
That I myȝte skapyn from prysoun
Thanne hadde I be in ioye and parfyt hele
There now I am exilyd from myn wele
Syn that I may not sen ȝow emalye
I nam but ded þere nys non oþer weye
Vp on that oþer syde palamon
Whan that he woste Arcyte was agon
Swich sorwe he makyth that þe grete tour
Resounnyth of hese ȝoulyng and clamour
The pure feterys of hese schenys grete
Weryn of hese bittere salte terys wete
Allas quod he arcita cosyn myn
Of al oure stryf god wot the freut is þyn
Thow walkyst now in thebes at þyn large
And of myn wo þou ȝeuyst lityl charge
Thu mayst sen þou hast wisdom and manhede


Assemblyn alle the folk of oure kynrede
And make a werre so scharp on this cyte
That by sum auenture or sum trete
Thw mayst haue here to lady and to wyf  
ffor whom that I muste nedys lese myn lyf
ffor as be weye of possibilite
Sithe þou art at thyn large of prisun fre
And art a lord gret is thyn auauntage
More than is myn that sterue here in a cage
ffor I mot wepe and waile whil I leue
With al the wo that prisoun may me ȝeue
And ek with peyne that loue me ȝeuyth also
That dubelyth al myn turment and myn wo
Therwith the fyr of ielusye vp sterte
Withinne hese brest and hente hym by the herte
So wodly that he lyk was to biholde
The boxtere or the asschyn dede and colde
Thanne seyde he O crewel goddis þat gouerne
This word woth byndyng of ȝoure word eterne
And wretyn in the table of athamaunte
Thorw parlemen and ȝoure eterne graunte
What is mankynde more on to ȝow holde
Thus is the schep that rokiþ in the folde
ffor slayn is man ryght as a nothir beste
And dwellith ek in prisoun and areste
And hath seknesse and gret aduersite
And ofte tyme gilteles parde
What gouernynge is in this prescience
That gilteles turmentyth innocence
And encreseth þis al myn penaunce
That man is boundyn to hese obseruaunce
ffor goddis sake to lettyn of hese wille
Ther as a beste may al hese lust fulfylle
And whan a beste is ded he hath no peyne
But man aftyr his ded hym muste wepe and pleyne
Though in þis world he haue care and wo


Withoutyn doute it may stondyn so
The answere of þis lete I to deuynys
But wel I wot that in þis world gret peyne is
Allas I se a serpent or a thef  
That manye a trewe man hath don myschef
Gon at hese large and wher hym liste may turne
But I mot ben in prisoun þour saturne
And ek thorgh Iuno ielous and ek wood
That hath distroyed wol ny al the blood
Of thebes with hese waste wallys wyde
And venus sleth me on þat oþer syde
ffor Ielousie and fer of hym Arcyte
Now wele I stynte of palamoun a lite
And late hym in hese prysoun stylle dwelle
And of Arcyta forth I wele ȝow telle
The somyr passeþ and the nyȝtys longe
Encresyn double wise the peynys stronge
Bothe of the louere and the prisounner
I not ho hath the wofulere myster
ffor schorth for to seyn this palamoun
Perpetuelly is dampned to prisoun
In cheynys and in feterys to ben ded
And Arcyte is exiled vp hese hed
ffor eueremo as out of that cuntre
Ne neuere mo schal hese lady se
Ȝow louerys axe I now þis questioun
Ho hath the werse arcyte or Palamoun
The ton may sen his lady day be day
But in prisoun ho mot dwelle alway
That othir where hym leste may ride or go
But sen hese lady schal he neuere mo
Now demyth as ȝow lyste ȝe þat can
ffor I wele telle forth as I began
Whan that Arcyte to thebes comyn was
fful ofte a day he swelte and seyde allas
ffor sen hese lady schal he neuere mo
And schortly to concludyn al hese wo
So meche sorwe hadde neuere creature
That is or schal whil that þe world may dure
Hese slep hese mete  hese drynk is hym beraft  
That lene he wex  and dreye as is a schaft
Hese eyne holwe  and gresely to beholde
Hese hewe falwe  and pale as asschen colde
And solitarie he was  and euere alone
And waylynge al the nyȝt makynge hese mone
And ȝif he herde song or instrument
Thanne myȝte he wepe he myȝte not be stent
So feble ek weryn hese spiritis and so lowe
And chaungit so þat no man coude hym knowe
Hese speche nor hese voys þow men it herde
And in hese ger for al the world he ferde
Not only lik the louere maladye
Of hereos but rathere lyk manye
Engenderid of humourys malencolik
Beforn hese owene selle fantastik
And schortly turned was al vp so doun
Bothe abit and ek disposicioun
Of his this woful louere daun Arcite
What schulde i of hese wo alday endyt
Whan he endured hadde a ȝer or to
This crewel turment and this peyne and wo
At thebes in his court as I seyde
Vp on a nyȝt in slep as he hym leyde
Hym thouȝte that the vengede god mercurye
Beforn hym stod and bad hym to be murye
Hese slepi ȝerde in hond he bar vp ryȝt
An hat he werede vp on hese herys bryȝt


Arayed was þis god as he tok kep
As he was whan that Argus tok hese slep
And seyde hym thus to Athenys schat þou wynde
There is the schapyn of thi wo an ende
And with that word Arcyte wok and styrte
Now trewely how sore that me smerte
Quod he tathenys  rygh now wele I fare
Ne for the dred of deth schal I not spare
To se myn lady that I loue and serue  
In here presence I rekke not to sterue
And with that word he cauȝte a gret myrour
And saw that schaunged was al hese colour
And say hese vesage al in anoþer kynde
And ryȝt anon It ran hym in hese mynde
That sithe hese face was so disfyguryd
Of maledye whiche he hadde endured
He myȝte wel ȝif that he bar hym lowe
Leuyn in athenys euere more onknowe
And sen hese lady wel ney day be day
And ryȝt anon he chaungede hese aray
And cladde hym as a pore labourer
And al alone saue only a squyer
That knew hese preuyteis and al hese cas
Whiche was disgised porely as he was
Tatthenys is he gon þe nexte way
And to the court he wente vpon a day
And at the gate he proferyth hese seruyse
To drogge and drawe what so men wolde deuyse
And schortly of this mater for to seyn
He fil in offys with a chaumbyrleyn
The whiche that dwellynge was with emalye
ffor he was wys and coude sone aspie
Of euery seruaunt whiche that seruyth here
Wel coude he hewyn wode and watyr bere
ffor he was ȝong and myȝty for the nonys
And þerto he was long and big of bonys


To don that ony with can hym deuyse
A ȝer or too he was in þis seruyse
Page of the chaumbere of emale þe bryȝt
And philostrate he seyde þat he hyȝt
But half so wel belouyd a man as he
Ne was there neuer in court of hese degre
He was so Ientyl of condicioun
That þourout al the court was hese renoun
They seydyn that it were a charite  
That Thesyus wolde enhaunsyn hese degre
And puttyn hym in worschepful seruyse
There that he myȝte hese vertue excercise
And þus withinne a while his name is spronge
Bothe of hese dedis and hese goode tunge
That Thesius hath takyn hym so ner
That of hese chaumbere he made hym a squyer
And ȝaf hym gold to meyntene his degre
And ek men brouȝtyn hym out of hese cuntre
ffrom ȝer to ȝer ful priuyly hese rente
But onestly and slyly he it spente
That no man wonderede how þat he it hadde
And thre ȝer in this wise his lyf he ladde
And bar hym so in pes and ek in werre
Ther was no man that thesyus hath derre
And in this blisse lete I now arcite
And speke I wele of palamoun a lite
In derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun
This seuene ȝer hath setyn palamoun
fforpynyd what for wo and for distresse
Who feleth doubble sorwe and heuynesse
But palamoun þat loue distreynyth so
That wod of hese wit he goth for wo
And ek þerto he is a presounner
Perpetuelly not only for a ȝer
Who coude ryme in englys properly
His marterdam for sothe it am not I


Therfore I passe as lyȝtely as I may
It fel that in the seuynte ȝer In may
The thredde nyȝt as olde bokys seyn
That al this story tellyn more and pleyn
Were it by auenture or destene
As whan a þyng is schapyn it schal be
That sone aftyr the mydnyȝt palamoun
Be helpyng of a frend brak hese presoun
And fleth the cete faste as he may go  
ffor he hadde ȝouyn hese gayler dronkyn so
Of a clarre mad of certeyn wyn
With nertotikes and opie of Thebes fyn
That al that nyȝt though þat men wolde hym schake
The gayler slep he myȝte not wake
And þus he fleth as faste as euere he may
The nyȝt was schort and faste by the day
That nedis cost  he muste hym seluyn hide
And tyl a groue faste þere besyde
With dredful fot þanne stalkyth palamoun
ffor schortely þis was hese opynnyoun
That in þat groue he muste hym hide alday
And in the nyȝt þanne wolde he take his way
To thebesward hese frendis for to preye
On Thesyus to helpe hym for to werye
And schortly oþer he wolde lese hese lyf
Or wynnyn emelye vnto hese wyf
This is theffect and hese entente pleyn
Now wele I turne vnto Arcite ageyn
That lityl wiste how nygh that was hese care
Tyl þat fortune hadde brought hym in þat snare
The besye larke messenger of the day
Salueth in here song the morwe gray
And fery phebus ryseth vp so bryght
That al the oryent laugheeth of þe lyght
And with hese stremys dreyeth in þe greuys
The syluere dropis hangynge in the leuys


And arcita that is in þe court royal
With Theseus is squyer pryncypal
Is resyn and lokyth on the merye day
And for to don hese obseruance to may
Remembrynge on the poynt of hese desyr
He on a courser stertelynge as the fyr
Is redyn in to þe feldis hym to pleye
Out of the court were it a myle or tweye
And to þe grene of wheche þat I ȝow tolde  
By auenture his weye he gan to holde
To make hym a garlond of the greuys
Were it of wodebynde or hawethorn leuys
And loude he song aȝen the sunne schene
May with alle thynne flourys and thynne grene
Welcome be þou fayre frosche may
In hope þat I sum grene getyn may
And from hese courser with a lusty herte
Into the greue ful hastyleche he sterte
And in a path he romede vp and doun
There as be auenture this palamoun
Was In a bosch that no man myȝte hym se
ffor sore ofered of hese death was he
Ne þyng ne knewe he that it was arcit
God wot he wolde a trowed it ful lite
But soth is seyd gon sithe manye ȝerys
That þe feld hath eyen and þe wode hath erys
It is ful fayr a man to bere hym euene
ffor al day metiþ men at vnset stevene
fful lityl wot arcyte of hese felawe
That was so nygh to heryn of hese tale
ffor in the bosch he sittyth now ful stylle
Whan þat Arcite hadde romede al hese fylle
And sungyn al the roundele lustyly
Into a stodye he fel sodeynly
As don þese louerys in here queynte geres
Now in the crop now doun in the brerys


Now vp now doun as boket in a welle
Ryȝt as the fryday sothly for to telle
Now it schynyth now it reynyth faste
Ryȝt so can gery venus ouercaste
The hertys of here folk ryȝt as here ȝe may
Is gerful ryȝt so chaungith sche aray
Selde is the fryday al the wouke lyk
Whanne that Arcyte hadde sunge he gan to sik
And sette hym doun withoutyn ony more  
Allas quod he that day þat I was bore
How longe Iuno thorw þyn crewelte
Wiltow werreyen Thebes the sete
Allas Ibrouȝt is to confusioun
The blod royal of Cadme and amphioun
Of Cadme wich þat was þe ferste man
That Thebes beelte  or fyrst þe toun began
And of the Sete fyrst was crounnede kyng
Of hese lynage was I  and hese ofspryng
By verray lyne  as of the stok royal
And now I am so kaytif and so thral
That he that is myn mortal enemy
I serue hym as hese squyer purely
And ȝit doth Iuno me more schame
ffor I dare not beknowe myn owene name
There as I was wone to hyȝte arcyte
Now highte I philostrate not worth a myȝte
Allas þou felle Mars allas Iuno
Thus hath ȝoure yre oure lynege fordo
Saue only me wrechede Palamoun
That Thesyus marteryth in presoun
And oueral þis to slen me vttyrly
Loue hath hese fery darte so brennyngely
Istekid þour myn trewe carful herte
That schapyn was myn deþ er þan myn scherte
Ȝe slen me with ȝoure eyen emelye
Ȝe ben the cause wherfore that I deye


Of al the remenaunt of myn oþer care
Ne sette I not the mountenauns of a tare
So þat I coude don ouȝt to ȝoure plesaunse
And with þat word he fyl down in a traunce
A long tyme and aftyrward he vp styrte
This palamoun þat thoute þat thorw hese herte
He felte a cold swerd sodeynliche glyde
ffor yre he quok  no lengere wolde he byde
And whan þat he hadde herd Arcytis tale  
As hewere wod with face ded and pale
He styrte hym vp out of the boschis þikke
And seyde arcite false traytour wikke
Now art þou hent þat louyst myn lady so
for whom þat I haue al þis peyne and wo
And art myn blod and to myn conseyl sworn
As I ful oftyn haue seyd þe here beforn
And hast beiapid here deuk Thesyus
And falsely chaunged þyn name thus
I wele ben ded or ellys þou schat deye
þou schat not loue myn lady Emalye
But I wele loue here only and no mo
ffor I am palamoun þyn mortal fo
And þow þat I no wepene haue in þis place
But out of prisoun am styrt by grace
I drede not þat outher þou schat deye
Or þou ne schat not louyn emalye
Ches which þou wit or þou schat not asterte
This Arcyte with ful dispitous herte
Whan he hym knew and hadde hese tale herd
As fers as lyoun pullede out a swerd
And seyde þus bi god that set aboue
Nere it þat þou art sek and wod for loue
And ek for þou no wepen hast in þis place
Thow schuldist neuere out of þis grene pase
That þou ne schuldist deyen of myn hond
ffor I defie the surete and the bond

Wiche þat þou seyst þat I haue mad to þe
What veray fol þink wel that loue is fre
And I wele loue here maugre al þyn myȝt
But for as meche þou art a worthy knyȝt
And wilnyst to darrayne here be batayle
Haue here myn trouthe tomorwe I nyl not fayle
Withoute wetynge of ony oþer whight
That here I wele be foundyn as a knyght
And bryngyn harneys ryȝt Inow for the  
And ches the best and lef the werste to me
And mete and drynk þis nyȝt wele I brynge
Inough for þe  clothis for þyn beddynge
And ȝif so be þat þou myn lady wynne
And sle me in þis wode þere I am inne
þou mayst wel han þyn lady as for me
This palamoun answerde I graunte it the
And þus þey be toparted til a morwe
Whan eche of hem hadde leyd hese feyth to borwe
O cupide out of alle charite
O regne that wolde no felawe han with the
fful soth is it seyd that loue and lordschep
Wolde not hese þankys han no felauschep
Wel fyndy þat arcite and palamoun
Arcite is rydyn anon in to þe toun
And on þe morwyn er it were day lyȝt
fful fynly to harneys haþ he dyȝt
Bothe sufficiaunt and mete to darreeyne
The batayle in the feld betweixe hem tweyne
And on hese horse alone as he was born
He caryeth al þis harneys hym beforn
And in the groue at tyme and place Iset
This arcite and þis palamo ben met
To chaunge gan the colour in here face
Rygh as the hunterys in the regne of trace
That stondiþ at the gap with a spere
Whan huntede is the lyoun or the bere


An herith hym come russchynge in the greuys
And brekith boþe the bowis and the leuys
And þynkyth here comyth myn mortal enemy
Withoute fayle he mote be ded or I
ffor eyþer I mote slen hym at the gap
Or he slen me ȝif that me mys hap
So ferdyn þey in chaungyng of here hewe
As fer as eueryche of hem oþer knewe
Ther nas no good day ne no saluynge  
But streyt withoute word or rehersynge
Eueryche of hem halp for to arme oþer
As frendly as he were hese owene brothyr
And aftyr þat with scharpe sperys stronge
They foynedyn eche at oþer wondyr longe
Thow myȝtist wene þat þis palamoun
In hese fyȝt were a wood lyoun
And as a cruel tygre was arcite
As wilde borys gunne þey to smyte
That frothyn white as fom for yre wod
Vp to the anches foute þey in here blod
And in this wyse lete I hem fyghtynge dwelle
And forth I wele of thesyus ȝow telle
The destenye mynystere general
That executyth in the world oueral
The puruyauns þat god hath seyn beforn


— For some men sain that God seeth all beforne
    
Than mote it fallen though men had it sworne
That purveiaunce hath seene beforne to be—
So strong it is þat thow þe world hadde sworn
The contrarye of a thyng be ȝa or nay
Ȝit sumtyme it schal fallyn on a day
That fallyth not eft with inne a thousent ȝere
ffor certeynly oure aspectis here
Be it of werre or pes or hate or loue
Al is þis reuled be the siȝte aboue
This mene I now be myȝty thesyus
That for to huntyn is so desirous
And namely at the grete hert in may
That in hese bed þere dawede hym no day


That he nys clad and redy for to ryde
With hunte and horn and houndis hym besyde
ffor in hese huntynge hath he swych delyȝt
That it is al hese Ioye and apetyt
To ben hym self the grete hertys bane
ffor ofte mars he seruyth now dyane
Cler was þe day as I haue told or this
And Thesyus with alle Ioye and blys  
With hese ypolita the fayre quene
And Emale clothed al in grene
On huntyng be þey redyn really
And to the groue stod ful faste by
In whech there was an hert as men him tolde
Deuk thesyus þe ryȝte weye hath holde
And to the launde he rydith hym ful ryȝt
ffor there was the hert wone to have his flyȝt
And ouer a brok and so forth on hese weye
This deuk wele han a cours with hym or tweye
With houndis which as hym lyste comaunde
And whan This deuk was comyn vnto þe launde
Vndir the sunne he lokyth and þat anon
He was war of Arcite and Palamon
That foutyn breme as it were boris too
The bryȝte swerdis wentyn to and fro
So hidously that with the leste strok
It semede as it wolde felle an ok
But what þey were no þyng he ne wot
This deuk hese courser with the sporys smot
And at a stert he was betwixe hem too
And pulle out a swerd and cryede hoo
No more vp peyne of lesynge of ȝoure hed
Be myghti mars he schal anon be ded
That smyth ony strok that I may sen
But telle me what myster men ȝe ben
That ben so hardy for to fytyn here
Withoutyn Iuge or oþer offiser


As it were in a listis ryaly
This Palamon answerde hastyly
And seyde sere what nedith wordis mo
We haue the deth deseruyd bothe two
Two woful wrechis ben we two caytyuys
That ben encomberit of oure owene lyuys
And as þou art a ryȝtful lord and Iuge
Ne ȝif vs neythir mercy ne refuge
But sle me ferst for seynte charite  
But sle myn felawe ek as wel as me
Or sle hym ferst for þow þou knowist it lyte
He is þyn dedly enemy arcyte
That fro þyn lond is banysschid on his hed
ffor which he hath seruyd to ben ded
ffor this is he that come on to þyn ȝate
And seyde that he hyte philostrate
Thus hath he Iapid þe ful manye a ȝer
And þow hast makid hym þyn squyer
And this is he that louyth Emelye
ffor sithe the day is come that I schal deye
I make pleyn myn confessioun
That I am thilke woful Palamoun
That hath thyn presoun broke wekedel
I am thi mortal fo  and it am I
That louyth so hote Emalia the bryȝte
That I wele deye present in here syȝte
Wherfore I aske deth and myn Iuwise
But sle myn felawe in the same wise
ffor bothe haue we disseruyd to ben slayn
This worthi deuk answerde anon agayn
And seyde þis is a schort conclusyoun
Ȝoure owene mouth be ȝoure confessioun
Hath dampned ȝow and I wele it recorde
It nedith not to pyne ȝow with the corde
Ȝe schul be ded be myȝty mars the rede
The quene anon for veray womanhede


Gan for to wepe and so dede emelye
And alle the ladyis in the cumpanye
Gret pete was it as it thoughte hem alle
That euere swich a chaunse schulde falle
ffor gentil men þey were of gret estat
And noþyng but for loue was this debat
And saw here blody woundis wide and sore
And alle criedyn both lasse and more
Haue mersi lord vpon vs wemen alle  
And on here bare kneis adoun þey falle
And wilde a kissede hese fet þere as he stod
Til at the laste aslakede was hese mod
ffor pete rennyt sone in gentil herte
And though he ferst for yre quok and sterte
he hath consideryd schortely in a clause
The trespase of hem bothe and ek the cause
And althow that hese yre hese gilt acused
Ȝit in hese resoun he hem bothe excused
As thus he thouthe wel that euery man
Wele helpe hym selve in loue ȝif that he can
And delyuere hym self ȝif that he moun
And ek hese herte hade compassioun
Of wemen for þey wepyn euere in on
And in hese gentil herte he thouȝte anon
And softe to hym self he seyde fy
Vpon a lord that wele haue no mercy
But byn a lyoun bothe in word and dede
To hem that ben in repentaunt and drede
As wel as to a proud dispitous man
That wele meyntene that he ferst began
That lord hath lityl discrecioun
That in swich cas hath no dyuysioun
But weyeth pride and humblesse aftyr on
And schortly whan hese yre is þus agon
He gan to lokyn vp with eyȝyn lyȝte
And spak these same wordis alle on hyȝte


The god of loue a benedicite
How myghti and how gret a lord is he
Aȝens hese myȝt þere geynyth none obstakell
He may be clepid a god for hese myrakell
ffor he can makyn at hese owene gyse
Of eueryche herte as he leste deuyse
Lo here þis arcite and þis Palamoun
That quytely weryn out of presoun
And myȝtyn a leuyd in thebes really  
And wetyn I am here mortal enemy
And that here deth lyth in myn myȝt also
And ȝit hath loue maugry here eyȝyn two
Brought hem hedyr bothe for to deye
Now lokith is not this an hey folye
Who may ben a fol but ȝif he loue
Behold for godis sake that sit aboue
Se how þey blede be þey not wel arayed
Thus hath here lord the god of loue hem payed
Here wagis and here feis for here seruyse
And ȝit þey wene for to ben ful wyse
That seynth loue for ouȝt that may befalle
But þis is ȝit the beste gise of alle
That sen for whom they han this iolyte
Kan hem therfore as meche thank as me
Sche wot no more of al this hote fare
By god than wot a kokkow or an hare
But al mote ben asayed hot or cold
A man mot nede ben a fol or ȝong or old
I wote it be myn self ful ȝore agon
ffor in myn tyme a seruaunt was I on
And þerfore syn I knowe of loue peyne
And wot how sore it can a man distreyne
As he that hath ofte be cauȝt in his las
I ȝow forȝeue al holy this trespas
At request of the quen that knelith here
And ek of emalye myn systir dere


And ȝe schul bothe anon vnto me swere
That neuere mo ȝe schul myn cuntre dere
Ne mak werre vpon me nyȝt ne day
But ben mynne frendys in al that ȝe may
I ȝow forȝeue þis trespas euerydel
And þey hym sworyn hise axinge fayre and wel
And hym of lordschepe and of mercy preyede
And he hem grauntede grace and þus he seyde
To speke of ryal lynage and of rychesse  
Thow that sche were a quen or a princesse
Eche of ȝow bothe is worthi douteles
To weddyn whan tyme is  but neuer the les
I speke as for myn sustyr Emalye
ffor whom ȝe han þis stryf of Ielousye
Ȝe wote ȝoure self sche may not wedde two
At onys þey ȝe fyȝte euere mo
To on of ȝow  al be hym loth or lef
He mote go pipe in an yuy lef
This is to seyn sche may not now han bothe
Al be ȝe neuere so Ielous ne so wrothe
And forthi I ȝow putte in þis degre
That eche of yow schal han hese destene
As hym is schapyn and herkenyth in what wyse
Lo here ȝoure ende of that I schal ȝow deuyse
Myn wil is this for plat conclusioun
Withoutyn ony replicacyoun
Ȝif that ȝow likyth tak it for the beste
That eueryche of ȝow schal gon ryȝt were hym leste
ffrely withoute raunsum or daunger
And þis day fifty woukis fer and ner
Eueryche of ȝow schal brynge an hunderit knyghtis
Armyd for lystis vp at alle ryghtis
Al redy to darrayne here by batayle
And this behote I ȝow withoutyn fayle
Vp on myn trouthe and as I am a knyȝt
That whethir of ȝow bothe that hath myght


This is to seyne that wheþer he or þou
May with hese hunderede as I spak of now
Sle hese contrarye or out of lystis dryue
Than schal I ȝeue Emalye to wyue
To whom that fortune ȝeuyth so fayr a grace
The lystis schal I make ryȝt here in þis plase
And god so wisely on myn soule rewe
That I schal euene Iuge ben and trewe
Ȝe schul non oþer ende with me make  
That on of ȝow schal be ded or take
And ȝif ȝow þynkith þis is wel Isayd
Seyth ȝoure auys and holdith ȝow apayed
This is ȝoure ende and ȝoure conclusyoun
Who lokyth lyȝtely now but palamoun
Who spryngyth vp for Ioye but arcite
Who couthe telle or who couthe endite
The Ioye that is now schewid in the place
Whan Thesius hath  don so fayr a grace
But doun on kneis wente euery man wiȝt
And þankede hym with al here herte and myȝt
And nameliche the thebens ofte sythe
And þus with god hope and with herte blythe
They take here leue and homward þey gunne ryde
To Thebes with olde wallys wyde
I trowe men wolde it deme necligence
Ȝif I forȝete to telle þe dispence
Of Thesius that goth so besily
To makyn vp the listis ryally
That swich a noble theatre as it was
I dar wel seyn in this world þere nas
The Cyrcuyt a myle was aboute
Wallyd of ston and dychid al withoute
Round was the schap in maner of cumpas


fful of degreis the heyȝte of sexty pas
That whan a man was set on a degre
He lettyth not his felawe for to se
Estward þere stod a gate of marbil whit
Westward swich a noþer in the opposit
And schortly for to conclude swich a place
Was non in erthe of so lytil space
ffor in the lond þere nas no crafty man
That iemetrye or arsmetrik can
Ne portretour ne keruere of ymagis
That Thesyus hym ȝaf mete and wagis
The theatre for to makyn and deuyse  
And for to don his ryte and sacryfise
He estward hath vp on the gate aboue
In worschepe of venus goddesse of loue
Don make an auter and an oratorye
And on the westward in memorye
Of mars he makyd hat ryȝt swich a noþer
That coste of gold largely a fother
And norward in a toret of the wal
Of alabastre whit and red coral
An oratorye ryche for to se
In worschepe of Diane of chastite
Hath Thesius don wrouȝt in noble wise
But ȝit hadde I forȝetyn to deuyse
The noble keruyng and the portreyture
The schap the contenaunce and the fygure
That weryn in these oratoryis thre
ffyrst in the temple of venus mayst þou se
Wrouȝt on the wal ful pitous to behold
The brokene slepis and the sikys colde
The secret terys and þe waymentyng
The fery strokys of the desyryng
That louys seruauntys of this lyf enduren
The Cothis that here couenauntys assuryn
Plesaunce hope desyr folhardynesse

Beute and ȝouthe baudrie richesse
Charmys and force lesynge and flaterye
Dispence besynesse and Ielousye
That werede of ȝelwe flourys a garlond
And a cokkow sittynge on hese hand
ffestis instrumentis karolys daunsis

Of loue whiche that I reken and rekne schal
Be ordere were peyntid on the wal
And mo þan I can make of mencyoun
ffor sothly al the mount of Cytheroun
There venus hath hese pryncipal dwellyng  
Was schewid in the wal in portreying
Videvi storie per tutto dipinte
    
El grand Ercole vide tra costoro VII 62
With al the gardyn and the besynesse
Not was forȝetyn the portyr ydilnesse
Ne narcyus the fayre of ȝore agon
And ȝit the folye of kyng salamon
And ek the grete strenthe of ercules

Thus may ȝe sen that wisdam ne rychesse

ffor as here lust the world þanne may sche gye
Lo alle these folk so cauȝt were in here lase
Til they for wo ful ofte seyde allas
Suffyseth here ensaumplys on or to
And þow I couthe rekene a thousent mo
The statue of Venus gloryous for to se
Was makyd fletynge in the large se
And from the nauelle doun al couered was
Which was grene and bryȝt as ony glas
A Cythole in here ryȝt hand hadde sche
And on here hed so semely for to se
A rose garlond frosch and wel smellynge


Aboue here hed here dounnys flekerynge
Byforn here stod here sone cupido
Vpon hese schulderys wyngis hadde he to
And blynd he was as it is ofte sene
A bowe he bar and arwys bryȝte and kene
Whi schulde I not as wel telle ȝow al
The portreyture that was vpon þe wal
Withinne the wal of myȝty mars the rede
Al peyntid was the wal in lenthe and brede
Lyk to the Estrys of the gresely place
That hyȝte the grete temple of Mars in Trace
In tylke colde frosty regyoun  
Ther as Mars hath hese souereyne mancyoun
ffyrst on the wal was peynted a forest
In whiche þere dwellith neyþer man ne beste
With knotty knarry bareyne treis olde
Of stubbis scharpe and hidous to beholde
In whiche þerein ran a rumbil in a swogh
As þow a storm schulde brestyn euery bowgh
And doun from an hyl vndyr a bente
There stod the temple of Mars armypotente
Wrouȝt al of bornede stel of wheche thentre
Was long and stryt and gastely for to se
And therout come a rage in swich a wese
That it made al the gate for to rese
The northren light In at the dorys shon
ffor wyndow on the wal was there non
Thorw whiche men myghte ony lyth discerne
The doris were ale of athamanutȝ eterne
Iclenchede ouerthwert and endelong
With yryn tough and for to make it strong
Euery peler the temple to susteyne
Was tunne gret of yryn bryȝt and schene
There saugh I fyrst the derke ymagynyng
Of felonye and the compassyng
The crewel yre red as ony glede


The pikepurs and the pale drede
The smylere with the knyf vndyr the cloke
The shepne brennynge with the blake smoke
The tresoun and the morderyng in the bed
The opene werre with woundis al bebled
Contek with blody knyf and scharp manace
Al ful of chyrkyng was that sory place
The sloere of hym self ȝit saw I þere
Hese herte blod hath bathed al hese here
The nayl Idreue in the schod a nyȝt
The colde deth with mouth gapynge vp ryght
In myddis of the temple there sat myschaunce  
With disconfort and sory cuntenauns
Ȝit saw I wodnesse laughynge in hese rage
Armyd compleynt  outes and fers corage
The careyn in the bosch with throte Ikorwe
A thousent slayn and not of qualm Istorve
The tyraunt with the pray by forse Iraft
The toun distroyed there was no þyng laft
Ȝit saw I brent the schepis hospesterys
The hunte strangeled with the wilde berys
The sowe fretyn the child ryȝt in þe cradil
The cook Iskaldit for al hese longe ladil
Nouȝt was forȝetyn by the infortune of marthe
The cartere ouyr redyn with hese carte
Vndir the whil ful lowe lay he adoun
There were also of martyrs dyvysioun
The labourer the bocher and the smyth
That forgith scharpe swerdis on the steyth
And al aboute depeyntid in a tour
Saw I conquest sittynge in gret honour
With the scharpe swerd ouyr his hed
Hangyng by a sotyl twynede thred
Depeyntid was the slautre of Iulyus
Of grete nero and of antonyus
Al be that ilke tyme they were onborn


Ȝit was here deth depeyntid þere beforn
By manasynge of mars ryȝt by fygure
So was it schewid in that portreture
As is depeyntid in the sertres above
Who schal be slayn or elle ded for loue
Suffiseth on ensaumple in storyis olde
I may not rekene hem thow I wolde
The statue of mars vpon a carte stod
Armyd and lokede grym as he were wod
And ouer hese hed þere schynyn two figurys
Of storyis þat ben clepid in scripturys
That on puella that othir Rubeus  
This god of armys was arayed thus
A wolf there stod beforn hym at hese fet
With eyȝyn rede and of a man he et
With sotyl pensel was depeyntid þis story
In redoutynge of mars and of hese glory
Now to the temple of dyane the chaste
As schortly as I can I wele me haste
To telle ȝow al the discripcioun
Depeyntid ben the walle vp and doun
Of huntyng and of schamfast schastite
Ther saw I how woful Calistope
Whan that dyane agreuyd was with here
Was turnyd from a woman til a bere
And aftyr was sche mad the lode sterre
That shynyth in the hevyn  from yow so ferre
Here sone is ek a sterre as men may se
There saw I dane Iturnede til a tre
I mene not the goddesse dyane
But Pennyus douȝtyr whiche that hyȝte dane
There saw I Attheon  an hert Imakid
ffor vengaunce that he saw dyane al nakyd
I saw how that hese houndis han hym caut
And fretyn hym for that þey knewe hym not
Ȝit peyntid was a lityl ferþere more


How atthalaunte huntid þe wilde bore
And Melyagre and manye anoþer mo
ffor whiche diane wrouȝte hym care and wo
There saw I manye anoþer wondir story
The wheche me lyste not drawe to memory
This goddesse on an hart  wol hye set
With smale hundys  al aboute here fet
And vndirnethe here fet  sche hadde a mone
Waxinge it was and schulde wanye sone
In gaude grene here statue clothede was
With bowe in hond and arwis in a cas
Here eyȝyn caste sche  ful lowe adoun  
Ther pluto hath  here derke regioun
A woman trauaylynge  hadde sche beforn
But for here child  so longe was onborn
fful pitusly lucyane gan sche calle
And seyde help for þou mayst best of alle
Wel coude he peynte lyfly that it wrouȝte
With manye a floreyn  heye it was bouȝte
Now ben these lystis  made and thesyus

Whan it was don  it likede hym wondyr wel
But stynte I wele of Thesyus a lyte
And speke of Palamoun and  Arcite

That eueryche schulde an hunderit knyȝtis brynge
The batayle to darrayn as I ȝou tolde
And to atenys here couenaunt for to holde
Hath eueryche of hem brouȝt an hunderit knyȝtis
Wel armede for to werre at alle ryȝtis
And sekyrly þere trowede manye a man

As for to spe of knyghthod of here hond
As fer as god hath makyd se and sond

ffor euery wyȝt that louede chyualry
And wolde hese þank han a passaunt name

And wel was hym that þerto schosyn was

And ryȝt so ferdyn þey with Palamoun  
With hym þere wentyn knyghtys manye on
Some wele ben armede in an habirioun
And in a brest plate and in a lyȝt Iopoun
And some wele haue a peyre platys large
And some wele haue a pruce schild or a targe
Some wele ben armyd on hese leggys wel
And han an ax and some a mace of stel

The Cerkelys of hese eyen  in hese hed

And lyk a grefoun lokede he aboute
With kempe herys on hese browys stoute
His lemys grete  hese brawnys grete and stronge
Hese schuderys brode hese armys rounde and longe
And as the gyse was in his cuntre

With foure white bolys in the trays
In stede of hese cote armour ouer hese harneys
With naylys ȝelwe and bryghte as ony gold

Hese longe her was kemb behynde his bak
As ony rauenys fedyr it schon for blak
A wrethe of gold  arm gret of heuge weighte
Vpon hese hed set ful of stonys bryghte
Of fynne rubeis and of dyamauntys
Aboute hese char there wente whyȝte Alauntis
Twenty and mo as grete as ony ster

And folwede hym with mosel faste Ibounde
Colerid of gold  and torettys fylede rounde
An hunderit lordis hadde he in hese route

Hese sadil was of brend gold newe bete

Of fyue and twenty ȝer  hese age I caste
Hese berd was wel begunne for to sprynge

And innede hem  euerych at hese degre

To esyn hem  and don hem alle honour
That ȝit men wenyn  that no mannys wit
Of non estat  ne coude amendyn it

Or whiche of hem can daunsyn best or synge
Ne who most felyngely  spekyth of loue

What houndys liggyn in the flor adoun
Of al this make I now no mencyoun
But al theffect that þynkyth me the beste
Now comyth the poynt  and herkenyth ȝif ȝow lyste

And in here hour he walkith forth a pas
Vnto the lystis there here temple was
And doun he knelith and with vmble chere
And herte sor  he seyde as ȝe shal here

Of prys of armys blowyn vp and doun

And ȝif ȝe wele not so myn lady swete

Al telle I not as now hese obseruaunce
But at the laste the statwe of Venus schok
And made a sygne wherby that he tok
That hese preyere acceptid was that day

Þo wiste he wel þat grauntid was hese bone
And with glad herte he wente hym hom ful sone
The threde hour inequal that Palamoun
Began to Venus temple for to gon
Vp ros the sunne and vp ros Emalye
And to the temple of dyane gan hye
Here maydenys þat sche thidir with her ladde

But how sche dede here ryte  I dar not telle

But it is good a man be at hese large

Vnto dyane sche spak  as ȝe may here

That alle here hote loue and al here desyr
And al here besy turment and here fyr

That sche was wol nygh mad and gan to crye

But only for the fer þus hath sche cryed
And wep þat it was pete for to here
And þerwithal diane gan apere

And by eterne world wretyn and confermyd
Thow schalt ben weddit vnto on of two

But vnto whiche of hem I can not telle

The furys whiche þat on myn auter brenne
Schul the declaryn or that þou go henne

And with þat word  þe arwis in the cas
Of the goddesse clateryn faste and rynge
And forthe sche wente and made auanysschynge

And hom sche goth anon the nexte weye
This is theffect þere is no more to seye
The nexte hour of Mars folwynge this

Of ferse Mars  to don his sacrifyse  
With al his rygh  of hese poyn devise
With pitous herte and hey deuocyoun
Rygh þus to Mars he seyde hese orysoun
O stronge god  that in the regnys colde
Of trace honoured art and lord Iholde
And hast in euery regne and euery lond
Of armys al the bridil in þyn hond
And hem fortunyst as the lyste deuyse
Accepte of me myn pitous sacrifyse
Ȝif it so be that myn ȝouthe may disserue
And that myn myght be worthi for to serve

And fond the lyggynge by his wife allas

Of ony place and alwey most laboure
In thyn pleasaunce and in thi craftys stronge
And in thi temple I mowe myn baner honge
And alle the armys of myn cumpanye
And euere mo vnto þat day I deye
Eterne fuyr I wele before the fynde
And ek to this awow I wele me bynde
Myn berd myn her that hangith long adoun
That neuere ȝit me felte offencyoun
Of rasour ne of schere I wele the ȝeue
And ben thyn trewe seruaunt whil I leue
Now lord haue routhe vp on mynne sorwis sore
Ȝif me the victorie I aske the no more
The preyer stynte of arcita the stronge
The ryngis on the temple dore that henge
And ek the doris clateredyn ful faste
Of which arcita sumwhat hym gaste
The fuyres brende vp on the autyr bryȝt
That it gan al the temple for to lyȝt
A swete smel anon the ground vp ȝaf
And arcita anon hese hond vp haf
And more ensens in to the fuyr he caste


With othere ryȝtys mo and at the laste
The statue of mars began hese hauberk rynge
And with that soun he herde a murmurynge
fful lowe and dym þat seyde þus victorye
ffor which he ȝaf  to Mars1 the glorye1
And þus with Ioye and and hope wel to fare
Arcita anon vnto his in is fare
As fayn as foul is of the bryȝte sunne
And ryȝt anon þere is swich stryf begunne
ffor thilke grauntynge in the heuene aboue
Betwixe venus the goddesse of loue
And mars the sterne god Armypotent  
That Iupiter was besi it to stynte
Til that þe pale saturne the colde
That knowith so manye of auentouris olde
ffond in hese old experience an art
That he ful sone hath plesid euery part
As soth is seyd elde hat gret auauntage
In elde is bothe wisdam and vsage
Men may the elde atrenne and not atrede
Saturne anon to stynte stryf and drede
Al be it þat it is ageyn hese kynde
Of al this stryf he gan remedie fynde
Myn dere douȝtyr venus quod saturne
Myn course þat hath so wyde for to turne
Hath more power than wit ony man
Myn is the drenchyng in the se so wan
Myn is the prisoun in the derke cote
Myn is the strangelyng and hangynge bi the throte
The murmur and the cherle rebellynge
The groynynge and the priue enpoysounynge
I do veniaunce and pleyn coreccioun
Whyl I dwelle in the sygne of the lyoun
Myn is the ruyne of the heye hallys
The fallynge of the tourys and of the wallys
Vpon the mynour or the carpenter


I slow Samson schakynge þe piller
And myne ben the maladijs colde
The darke tresounnys and the castis olde
Myn lokynge is þe fadir of pestelence
Now wep no more I schal don diligence
That Palamoun that is þyn owene knyȝt
Schal han hese lady as þou hast hym hyȝt
Though Mars schal helpe hese knyȝt ȝit neuertheles
Betwixen ȝow there may ben sumtyme pes
Alle be ȝe not of on complexioun
That causeth al day swich dyuysioun
I am thyn aiel redi at thyn wille  
Wep now no more I wil þyn lust fulfylle
Now wil I stynte of the goddis aboue
Mars and venus goddesse of loue
And tellyn ȝow as goodly as I can
The grete effect for whiche þat I began
Gret was the feste in Athenys þat day
And ek the lusti sesen of þat may
Made euery whitht to ben in swich plesaunce
That al that moneday Iustene they and daunce
And spendyn it in venus hey seruyse
And by the cause that þey schulde ryse
Erly for to sen the grete fyȝt
Vnto here reste wente þey þat nygh
And on the morwe whan þat day gan sprynge
Of hors and harneys noyse and claterynge
There was in ostelleryis al aboute
And to the paleys rod þere manye a route
Of lordys vpon stedis and palfreyis
There mayst þou sen  deuysyng of harneys
So vncouth and so ryche and wrough so wel
Of gold smetheris  of broudynge and of stel


The scheldys bryghte testers and trappurys
Gold hew helmys hauberkis cote armurys

Knyghtis of retenew and ek squyerys
Naylynge the sperys and helmys bokelynge
Giggynge of schyldys with lanyerys lasynge
Ther as nede is þey were no þyng ydyl
The fomy stedis on the goldene brydyl
Gnawynge faste the armurys also
With fyle and hamyr prikynge to and fro
Thanne on fote comounnys manye on
With schorte stauys  as thikke as þey may gon
Pypis trumpis nakerys claryounnys
That in the batayle blowyn blody sounys
The paleys ful of peplys vp and doun  
Here thre þere ten  holdynge here questyoun
Deuynynge of these  thebene knyghtis too
Some seyde thus  some seydyn it schulde be so
Some heldyn with hym with the blake berd
Some with the ballede some with the thykke herid
Some seyde he lokede grymme and he wolde fyghte
He hath a sparth of twenty pound of weighte
Thus was the halle ful of dynynynge
Longe aftyr that the sunne began to sprynge
The grete thesyus that of hese slep awakyd
With mynstrelsye and noyse that was makyd
Held ȝit the chambre of hese paleys ryche
Tyl that the theben knyghtis bothe Iliche
Honoure weryn  into the paleys fet
Deuk thesyus is at a wyndowe set
Arayed wel as he were a god in trone
The puple presede dedyrward ful sone
Hym for to sen and don hey reuerence
And ek to herkene his hest and his sentence
An heraud on a skaffald made an hoo
Til al the noyse of the puple was Ido


And whan he say  the noyse of puple al stylle
Tho schewede he the myghty dukis wille
The lord hath of hese hey discrecyoun
Consyderit þat it were distructyoun
To gentyl blod to fygtyn in the gyse
Of mortel batayle now in this empryse
Wherfore to schapyn þat þey schul not dye
He wele hese ferste purpos modyfye
No man þerfore vp peyne of los of lyf
No maner schort polax  no schort knyf
In to the lystys sende ne dedyr brynge
Ne schort swerd for to steke with poynt bytynge
No man it drawe ne bere it by hese syde
Ne no man schal vn to hese felawe ryde
But on cours with a scharp Igrounde spere  
ffayn ȝif hym lyst  on fote hym self to were
And he that is at myschef schal be take
And not slayn  but ben brought vnto the stake
That schal ben ordeynyd on eyþer syde
But dedir he schal be forse and þere abyde
And ȝif so falle the cheuynteyn be take
On eythyr syde or ellys slen hese make
No lengere schal the turnyinge leste
God spede ȝow goth forth  and leyth on faste
With long swerd and with macys fytyth ȝoure fylle
Goth now ȝoure wey  this is the lordys wille
The voys of peple touchede the heuene
So longe cryedyn þey with merye steuene
God sawe swich a lord þat is so good
He wylnyth non distructioun of blod
Vp goth the trumpys and the melodye
And to the lystis rit the cumpaynye
By ordenaunce Throuout The sete large
Hangit with cloth of gold and not with sarge
fful lyk a lord þis noble deuk gan ryde
These too thebenys vp on eyþer syde


And aftyr rod the quen and emelye
And aftyr þat a noþer cumpanye
Of on and oþer aftyr here degre
And thus þey passyn thour out the cite
And to the lystis come þey betyme
It nas not of the day fully pryme
Whan set was Thesyus ful ryche and hye

And oþere ladyis in degreis aboute
Vnto the setis  presith al the route
And westwardis thorugh þe gatys vndyr marthe

With baner red is enteryd rygh anon
And in that selue moment Palamon
Is vndyr venus Estward in the place  
With baner whit and hardy cher and fac
In al the world to sekyn vp and doun
So euene withoute variacyoun
There ne were sweche cumpanyis tweye
ffor þere ne was non that coude seye
That ony hadde of oþer auauntage
Of worthynesse ne of estat ne age
So euene were þey chosen for to gesse
And too ryngis fayre þey hem dresse
Whan that here namys rad were euerychon
That in here noumbre gile was þere non
Tho were the gatys schette and cryed was loude
Do now ȝoure deuer ȝynge knyghtis proude
The heroudys lefte here prykynge vp and doun
Now ryngyn trompys loude and claryoun
There is no more to seyne but west and est
In gon the sperys ful gladly in at rest
In goth the scharpe spere in to þe syde
Ther sen men ho can Iuste and ho can ryde

Vp spryngyn sperys twenty fote on heyghte

Out brest the blod with sterne stremys rede
With myghty macys the bonys they tobreste

There semblyn stedys stronge and doun goth al

He foynyth on hese feet with hese trunchoun
And he hym hurtelith with hese hors adoun
He thour the body is hurt and sithe take
Magry his hed and brough vnto the stake
As forward was  ryȝt þere he wolde abyde
Anoþer lad is on that oþer syde
And sumtyme doth hem Thesius to reste  
Hem to frossche and drynkyn ȝif hem leste
fful ofte a day han these Thebens two
Togedere Imet and wrought hese felawys wo
Vnhorsede hath eche oþer of hem tweye
Ther nas no Tigre in the vale of Galgopheye
Whan that here whelp is stole whil it is lyte
So crewel on the hunte as is arcyte
ffor Ielous herte vpon this Palamoun
Ne in Belmarye þere ne is non so fel lyoun
That huntid is or for hese hungyr wod
Ne of hese prey desyreth so the blod
As Palamoun to slen hese fo Arcyte

Out rennyth blod on boþe here sydis rede
Sumtyme an ende þere is of eyþer dede
ffor er the sunne vnto þe reste wente
The strong kyng  emetryus gan hente
This Palamoun as he faught with Arcyte
And made his swerd depe in hese flesch to bite
And be the forse of twenty is he take
Vnȝoldyn and Idrawyn to the stake


And in the rescous of this palamoun
The stronge kyng lygurge is born adoun
And kyng Emetrius  for hese strenthe
Is born out of hese sadil a swerdis lenthe
So hitte hym palamoun or he were take
But al for nought he was brought to the stake
Hese hardy herte myghte hym helpe nought
He muste abyde whan that he was caught
By forse and ek by compocycioun
Who sorwith now but woful palamoun
That may no more gon ageyn to fyghte
And whan that Thesius hadde seyn that syghte
Vnto the folk that foughtyn thus echon
He cryede ho  no more for it is don
I wele be trewe iuge and no partye  
Arcite of Thebes schal haue Emelye
That bi hese fortune hath here fayre wonne
Anon þere is a noyse of puple begunne
ffor ioye of this so loude and heye with al
It semede þat the lystis schulde fal
What can now fayre venus don aboue
What seyth sche now  what doth this quen of loue
But wepith so  for wantynge of here wille
Tyl þat here terys in the lystis fylle
Sche seyde I am aschamyd duteles
Saturne seyde douȝtyr hold þyn pes

And be myn hed þou schat ben esed sone

The heroudis þat ful loude ȝelle and crye
Ben in here wele for ioye of daun Arcyte
But herkenyth me and styntyth now a lite
Which a merakele þere befel anon
This ferse arcyte hath of hese helm Idon
An on a courser for to schewe hese face

Lokynge vpward vp on þis Emelye
And sche ageyn hym caste a frendely ye
    
    
And was al hese cher as in hese herte
Out of the ground a furye infernal sterte
ffrom pluto sent at request of saturne
ffor which hese hors for fer gan to turne
And lep a syde and founderede as he lep
And er þat arcite may takyn kep
He pyghte hym on the pomel of hese hed
That in þe place he lay as he were ded
His brest tobrostyn withe sadil bowe
As blak he lay as ony cole or crowe
So was the blod ronnyn in hese face
Anon he was Iborn out of the place
With herte sor to theseus paleys  
Tho was he korvyn out of hese harneys
And in a bed Ibrout ful fayre and blythe
ffor he was ȝit in memory and alyue
And alwey cryinge aftyr Emelye

With al blys and gret solempnete
Al be it þat this  auenture was falle

Men seyde ek that Arcita schal not deye

And of a noþer þyng þey wern as fayn
That of hem alle was þere non Islayn
Alle were þey sore Ihurt and namely on
That with a spere was therlyd hese brest bon
To othere woundis and to brokene armys
Some haddyn saluys and some haddyn charmys

Þey dronken  for þey woldyn here lemys haue


ffor which this noble deuk as he wel can
Confortyth and honoureþ euery man
And made reuel al the longe nyght
Vn to þo straunge lordis as was ryght
Ne þere was holdyn non disconfitinge
But as a iustis or a turneynynge
ffor sothely þere was non disconfiture
ffor fallynge nys not but an auenture
Ne to be lad be forse on to the stake
Vnȝoldyn and with twenty knyghtis Itake

And haried by arm fote and to
And ek hese stede dreuyn forth with stauys
With footmen bothe ȝemen and ek knavys

ffor which anon deuk Theseus let crye  
To styntyn alle rancure and enuye

And eythyr syde liche lyk a oþeris brothir
And ȝeue hem ȝiftys aftyr here degre
And fully held a feste dayis thre
And conueyed þe kyng worthily
Out of hese town a iurne largely
And hom wente euery man the ryghe way
Þere was no more but farwel and heue good day
Of this batayle I wele no more endyte
But speke we of palamoun and arcite
Swellyth the brest of Arcite and the sor

And euery lacerte in hese brest adoun

Hym gaynyth neyþer for to gete his lyf
Vomyt vpwar ne dounward laxatyf

And serteynly þere nature wele not werch

This al and sum that arcite mot deye

Thanne seyde he þus as ȝe schul aftyr here
Nowt may the woful spyrt in myn herte

Do ȝow myn lady that I loue most  
But I bequethe the spyrit of myne gost

That I for ȝow haue suffered and so longe
Allas the deth allas myn Emelye
Allas the partynge of oure cumpaynye
Allas myn hertis quene allas myn wif

What is this world what askyn men to haue
Now with hese loue now in hese colde graue
Alone withoutyn ony cumpanye
ffarewel myn swete fo myn emelye
And softe tak me in ȝoure armys tweye
ffor loue of god and herkene what I schal seye

Had strif and rancur manye a day agon
ffor loue of ȝow and for myn Ielusye
And Iupiter so wisely myn soule gye


To spekyn of a seruaunt proprely

So worthi to be louyd as palamon
That seruyth ȝow and wele don al hese lyf
And ȝif that euere ȝe schul be a wif
fforȝet not palamoun the gentyl man
And with that word hese speche fayle gan
ffor from hese herte vp to hese brest was come
The colde of deth þat hadde hym ouercome
And ȝit more ouyr for in hese armys two
The vital strenthe is lost and al ago
Only the intellect withoutyn more  
That dwellede in hese herte syk and sore

Dusked hese eyne þo and faylede breth
But on hese lady ȝit caste he hese eye
Hese laste word was mercy Emelye

Therefore I stynte I neam no dyuynystere
Of soulys fynde I not in þis registre

Of hem though they write  where þat þey dwelle

Now wele I speke forth of Emelye

Of no party or of a cantel of a þyng
But of a þyng þat parfyt is and stable
Dessendynge so til it be corumpable
And þerfore for hese wise puruyaunce
He hath so wel beset hese ordenaunce
That specyfie of þyngis and progressiounnys
Shul endure be succesciounnys
And not eterne withoutyn ony lye
This mayst þou vndyrstondyn and sen at eye
lo þe ok that hath so long a norichynge  
ffrom the tyme þat it ferst begynnyth to sprynge
And hat so long a lyf as we may se
Ȝit at the laste wastyd is the tre
Considerith ek how that the harde ston
Vndir oure fet on whiche we trede and gon
Ȝit wastith it as it lyth be the weye
The brode reuyr sumtyme waxeth dreye
The grete tounnys se we wane and wende
Than may I say þat al þis thyng hath ende
Of man and woman se we we wel alsoo
That nedyth in on of þese termys too
This is to seyne in ȝouthe or ellys age
He mote be ded the kyng as schal a page
Some in his bed some in the depe se
Some in the large feld as men may se
There helpith not al goth that ilke weye
Thanne may I seyn al þis þyng mote nedis deye
What makyth þis but Iupiter þe kyng
That is prynce and cause of alle thyng
Conuertynge al vnto hese propere welle
ffrom wiche it is deryvit soth to telle


And here ageyn no cryatour on lyue
Of no degre auaylith for to stryue
Thanne is it wisdom as it þynkyt me
To makyn vertu of necessite
And take it wel that we may not eschewe
And nameli that to vs alle is dewe
And ho so grochit out he doth folye
And rebel is to hym þat al may gye
And serteynly a man hath most honour
To deyen in hese excellence and flour
Whan he is sekyr of hese goode name
Thanne hath he don hese frend ne hym no schame
And gladdere owith hese frend to ben of deth
Whan with honour is ȝoldyn vp hese breth
Than whan his name apeyred is for age  
ffor al forgetyn is his wasseyllage
Thanne is it best as for a worthi fame
A man to deye whan he is best of name
The contrarie of al this is wilfulnes
Why groche we why haue we heuynes
That goode arcite of chyualrye flour
Departid is with deynte and honour
Out of þis foule prysoun of þis lyf
Why grochyn here his cosyn and his wif
Of 
Can he hem thank nay god wot neuere adel
That boþe hese soule and ek hym self offende
And ȝit þey mowe here lustis not amende
What may I conclude of þis longe serye
But aftyr wo I rede vs to be merye
And thankyn Iupiter of al hese grace
And er þat we departe from þis place
I rede we make of sorwys too
On parfyt Ioye lastynge eueremo
And lokyth now where most sorwe is her inne
There 

With alle thaues heere of my parlement
That gentyl palamon ȝoure owne knyght
That seruyth ȝou with wil herte and myght
As euer hath don sithen ȝe first hym knewe
That ȝe shul of ȝoure  vpon him rewe
And taken for husbond and for lord
Lene me ȝoure hond for this is oure acorde
Lete see now if youre wommanly pitee
He is a kingis brother sone parde

Than seyde he þus to palamoun ful rygh
I trowe þere nedyth lytil sarmonynge
To make ȝow assente to the thynge
Come ner and tak ȝoure lady bi the hond
Bytweþyn hem was mad anon the bond
That hyghte matrymonye or mariage
By al the cuntre and the barounnage
And þus with al blys and melody
Hath Palamoun Iwedded emely
And god þat al þis wyde word hath wrought
Synde hym his loue þat hath it dere abought
ffor now is Palamoun in alle wele
leuynge in blysse in richesse and in hele
And Emelye hym louyth so tenderely
And he here seruyth so gentylly
That neuere was þere no word hem betwen
Of Ielousye or ony oþer teene
Thus endyth Palamoun and Emelye
And god saue al this ffayre cumpaynye
SO whan þe knyght hath þus hese tale told  
In al þe route nas þere ȝyng ne old
That he ne seyde it nas a noble story
And worthy for to drawe to memory
And nameli þe gentilis euerychon
Our ost lough and swor so mote I gon
Thys goth aryght onbokeled is the male
Let sen now who schal telle a noþer tale
ffor trewely the game is wel begunne
Now tellyth ȝe sere monk ȝyf þat ȝe cunne
Sumwhat to quite with þe knyghtis tale
The mellere that dronke was al pale
So that anethe vp on his hors he sat
He nulde avale neythyr hod ne hat
Ne abyde no man for hese curteysye
But in pilat voys he gan to crye
And swor by armys and by blod and bonys
I can a noble tale for thenonys
With whiche he wele now quyte þe knyȝtis tale
Oure ost saw þat he was dronke of ale
And seyde abyd Robyn myn leue brothyr
Sum betere man schal telle vs fyrst a nothyr
Onbyd and lat vs werke thryftyly
By goddys soule  quod he þat wele nat I
ffor I wele speke or ellys gon myn wey
Oure ost answerde telle on a delewey
Thow art a fol thy wit is ouercome
Now herkenygh quod the mellere alle and some
But fyrst I make a protestacyoun
That I am dronke I knowe it be myn soun
And þerfore ȝif I mys speke or seye
Wite it the ale of Southwerk I preye


ffor I wele telle a legende and a lyf
Bothe of a carpenter and hese wyf
How that a clerk hath set the wryghtis cappe
The reue answerde and seyde stynt þyn clappe
let be þyn lewede dronke harlotrye  
It is a synne and ek a gret folye
To apeyre ony man or hym diffame
And ek to bryngyn whyuys in swych fame
þou mayst Inow of oþere thyngis sayn
This dronkyn mellere spak ful sone ageyn
And seyde leue brothyr Osewold
Ho hath no wif he is no coukewold
But I seye not þerfore þat þou art on
There ben ful goode wivis manyon
And euer a thousent goode aȝens on badde
That knowyst þou wel þyn self  but ȝif þou madde
Why art þou angry with myn tale now
I haue a wif also as wel as þou
Ȝit nolde I not for the oxsyn in myn plow
Takyn vp on me more þan Inow
As demyn in myn self þat þou were on
I wele beleue wel þat I ne am non
An husbonde schal not ben inquysityf
Of goddis priuyte nor of hese wyf
So he may fyndyn godis foysounn there
Of the remenaunt nedyth not tenquyre
What schalde I seyn But this mellere
He wolde hese wordys for no man forbere
But tolde hese cherlych tale in hese manere
Me thynkyth I schal reherse it here
And þerfore euery gentyl wygh I preye
ffor goddys loue demyth not þat I seye
Of euyl entent but for I mot reherse
Here talys al be þey betere or werse
Or ellys fallyn sum of myn matere
And þerfore who so leste it not here


Turne ouer the lef and ches a noþer tale
for he schal fynde Inowe grete and smale
Of storyal thyng þat touchith gentillesse
An ek Morallite and holynesse
Blamyth not me ȝif ȝe chesyn amys  
The mellere is a cherl ȝe knowe wel this
So was the reue and oþere manye mo
And harlotrye þey tolde bothe to
Avyseth ȝow put me out of blame
And ek men schal not makyn ernest of game
WHilhom þere was dwellinge in Oxenforde
A ryche gnoff þat gestis helde to borde
And of his craft a carpenter
With hym þere was dwellynge a pore scoler
Hadde lernede art but of hese fantasye
Was turned for to lernyn astronomye
And coude a certyn of conclusiounys
To demyn by interrogacyounnys
Ȝif that men axsed hym in certeyn hourys
Whan men schulde haue droughte or elle schourys
Or ȝif men axsede hym what schulde befalle
Of euery thyng I may not rekene hem alle
This clerk was clepid hende nycholas
Of derne loue he coude and of solas
And þerto he was sly and ful preue
And lyk a mayde meke for to se
A chambre hadde he in that ostelrye
Alone withoutyn ony compaygnye
fful fetously Idygh with erbis sote
And he hym self as swete as is the rote
Of licorys or ony Cetewale
Hese almageste and bokys grete and smale
Hese augrym stonys lynge fayre apart
Hese astellabre longynge for hese art
On scheluys couchede at hese bedys hed
Hese presse Icouered with a faldynge red
And al aboue þere lay a gay sautrye
On whiche he made on nyghtis melodye
So swetely þat al the chambere rong  
And Angelus ad uirginem he song
And aftyr þat he song the kyngis note
fful oftyn blyssede was hese mery throte


And þus this swete clerk hese tyme he spente
Aftyr hese frendys fyndynge and hese rente
This carpenter hadde weddid newe a wyf
Whiche þat he louede more þan hese lyf
Of eightene ȝer sche was of age
Ielous he was and held here narwe in cage
ffor sche was wilde and ȝyng and he was old
And demede hym self  ben lyk a coukewold
He knew not catoun for hese wit was rude
That bad men schulde wedde here symylitude
Men schulde wedde aftyr here estat
ffor ȝoughte and elde ben oftyn at debat
But sythyn þat he was fallyn in the snare
He muste endure as oþere folk hese care
ffayr was þis ȝonge wif and þerwith al
As ony wesele here body gent and smal
A seynt sche werede þe seynt al of sylk
A barme cloth as whit as ony mylk
Vp on here lendis ful of manye a gore
Whit was here smok Ibrouded al before
And ek behyndyn on here coller aboute
Of col blak silk withinne and ek withoute
The tapes of here white voluper
Were of the same sute of here coller
Hyre filet brod of silk Iset ful hye
And sekyrly sche hadde a lycorous eye
fful smale Ipullede were hese browis to
And þo were bent and blake as is a slo
Sche was more blysful on to se
Than is the newe pere Ionete tre
And softere than is the wolle of a wedyr
And by here gerdil heng a purs of ledyr
Tassellid with sylk and perlit with latoun  
In al this world to sekyn vp and doun
There is no man so wys that coude thynche
So gay a popelote or swych a wenche


fful bryght was the schynynge of here hewe
Than in þe tour the noble forgit newe
But of here song it was as loude and ȝerne
As ony swalwe syttynge on a berne
And þerto sche coude skippe and make game
As ony kede or kalf folwende hese dame
Here mouth was swete as braket or the methe
Or hord of appillis leyd in hay or hethe
Wynsynge sche was as is a ioly colt
Long as a mast and vp ryght as a bolt
A broche she bar vp on here lowe coler
As brod as is the bos of a bokeler
Here schois were lasyd on here leggis hye
Sche was a prymrole and a piggis nye
ffor ony lord to liggyn in hese bedde
Or ek for ony good ȝeman to wedde
Now sere and eft sere so befel the cas
That on a day this hendyn Nicholas
ffil with þis ȝynge wif rage and pleye
Whil þat here husbonde was at Hoseneye
As clerkys ben ful sotyl and ful queynte
And priuyly he caughte here bi þe queynte
And seyde Iwis but I mowe haue myn wille
ffor derne loue of the lemman I spille
And held here harde be the haunche bonys
And seyde lemman loue me al at onys
Or I wele deyin al so god me saue
And sche sprong as a colt doth in the traue
And with here hed sche wrythed faste awey
Sche seyde I wel not kysse þe be my fey
Whi let be quod sche let be nycholas
Or I wele crye out harrow allas
Do wey ȝoure hondis for ȝoure curteysy  
This nycholas gan mercy for to cry
And spak so fayre and proferede hym so faste
That sche here loue hym grauntede at þe laste


And swor here oth be seynt Thomays of kent
That he wolde ben at hese comaundement
Whan þat sche may here layser wel asspye
Myn husbonde is so ful of Ielousye
That but ȝe waite wel and ben priue
I wot ryght wel I am but ded quod sche
Ȝe muste ben ful derne as in þis cas
Nay þerof care ȝe not quod Nicholas
A clerk hadde lethyrly beset hese while
But ȝif he coude a carpenter begyle
And þus they ben acordit and Isworn
To wayte a tyme as I haue told beforn
Whan Nicholas hadde don þis euery del
An thakkede here aboute the lendis wel
He kyssith here swete and takyth hese sautrye
And pleyeth faste and makyth melodye
Thanne fel it thus þat to þe parich cherche
Crystys owene werkys for to werche
This goode wyf wente on an haly day
Here forehed schon as bryght as ony day
So was it wasschyn whan sche let here werk
Now was þere of that cherche a parysch clerk
The wheche þat was clepid absolon
Crol was hese her and as þe gol it schon
And strut as a fan large and brod
fful streyt and euene lay hese Ioly schod
His rode was red hese eyȝyn greye as gos
With poulys wyndow Ikorwyn on hese schois
In hosyn rede he wente fetusly
Iclad he was ful smal and properly
Al in a kyrtel of a lyght vachet
fful fayre and thikke  ben the poyntis set
And þerupon he hadde a gay surplys  
As whit as is the blome on the rys
A merye chyld he was so god me saue
Wel coude he letyn blod and wel schaue


And make a chartere of lond and aquitaunce
In twenty manerys coude he trippe and daunce
Aftyr the skole of Oxenforthe þo
And with hese leggis castyn to and fro
And pleyen songys on a smal rubybe
Therto he song sumtyme a loud quynyble
And as wel coude he pleye on a geterne
In al the toun nas brew hous ne tauerne
That he ne visityd with hese solas
There ony galiard tapstere was
But soth to seyn he was sumdel coymous
Of fartynge and of speche daungerous
This absalon that Ioly was and gay
Goth with a senser on the halyday
Sensynge þe wyuys of the parych faste
And manye a louely lok on hem he caste
And namely on þis Carpenterys wyf
To loke on here he thouȝte a merye lyf
Sche was so propere and swete and lycurous
I dar wel seyn ȝif sche hadde ben a mous
And he a cat he wolde here hente anon
This parych clerk þis Ioly Absalon
Hath in hese herte swich a louelongynge
That of no wif tok he non offerynge
ffor curteysye he seyde he wolde non
The mone whan it was nyght ful bryghte it schon
And absalon hadde hese geterne take
ffor paramourys he thoughte for to wake
And forth he goth Iolyf and amerous
Tyl he come to þe carpenterys hous
A lytil aftyr þe cokkys hadde crowe
And dressede hym vp be a schot wyndowe
That was vp on the carpenterys wal  
He syngyth in hese wois gentil and smal
Now dere lady ȝif thyn wille be
I preye ȝow that ȝe wele rewe on me


fful wel acordaunt to hese geternynge
This carpentire awok and herde hym synge
And spak vn to hese wyf and seyde anon
What alysoun heryst not þou absalon
That schauntyth þus vndyr oure bouris wal
And sche answerde here husbonde þerwithal
Ȝis god wot Ihun I here it euerydel
This passeth forth what wele ȝe bet þan wel
ffrom day to day this Ioly Absolon
So wowith here þat hym is wo begon
He wakyth al the nyght and al the day
He kempte hese lokys brode and made hym gay
He wowith here be menys and procage
And swor he wolde ben here owene page
He syngyth brokkynge as a nyghtyngale
He sente here pyment mede and spicede ale
And waferys pipinge hote out of the glede
ffor sche was of tounne he proferede mede
ffor sum folk wele be wonne for richesse
And some for strokys and some for gentillesse
Sumtyme to schewe hese lyghtnesse and maystrie
He pleyeth heroudis vp on a skafald hye
But what auaylyth hym in þis cas
Sche louyth so þis hende Nicolas
That Absalon may blowe the bukkys horn
He ne hadde for al hese labour but a skorn
And sche makyth Absalon here ape
And al hese ernest is turnyd tyl a Iape
fful soth is this prouerbe it is no lye
Men seyth ryght þus the nyght slye
Makyth the chartere lef to be looth
ffor thow that absalon be wod or wroth
Be cause þat he fer was from here syght  
This nyght Nicholas stod in hese lyght
Now bere the wel þou hende nycholas
ffor absalon may wepe and synge allas


And so befel it on a satyrday
This carpenter was gon to Osenay
And hende nycholas and Alysoun
Acordede ben to this conclusioun
That Nicholas schal schapyn hym a wile
This sely Ielous husbonde to begyle
And ȝif so be this game wente aryght
Sche schulde slepe in hese armys al nyght
ffor this was here desyr and hese also
And rygh anon withoutyn wordys mo
This nicholas no lengere wolde tarye
But doth ful softe vnto hese chambere carye
Bothe mete and drynk for a day or tweye
And to here husbonde bad here for to seye
Ȝif that he axede aftyr Nicholas
Sche schulde seye he nyste neuer wher he was
Of al þe day sche say hym not with ye
Sche trowyth þat he was in malady
ffor no cry here mayde coude calle
He nulde answere for no thyng that myghte falle
This passeth forth al þat satyrday
That Nicholas stille in hese chambere lay
And et and slep and dede what hym lyste
Thil soneday þat the sunne goth to reste
This sely carpenter hath so gret merueyle
Of Nicholas or what thyng myghte hym eyle
And seyde I am adred be seynt thomays
It stondyth not arygh with nycholas
God schylde þat he deyede sodeynly
This world is now ful tekyl sekyrly
I saw to day a cors boryn to scherche
That now on moneday last I saugh hym werche
Go vp quod he vn to hese knaue anon  
Clepe at hese dore or knokke with a ston
Loke how it is and telle me boldely
This knaue goth hym vp ful sturdyly


And at the chambere dore whil that he stod
He cryede and knokkede as þey he were wod
What how what do ȝe Maystyr Nicholay
How may ȝe slepen al the longe day
But al for nought he herde not a word
An hole he fond ful lowe vp on a bord
There as the cat was wont in for to crepe
And at the hole he lokede in ful depe
And at the laste he hadde of hym a sygh
This Nicholas sat alwey gapynge vp rygh
As he hadde kykyd on the newe mone
Adoun he goth and tolde hese maystyr sone
In what aray he saw this ilke man
This carpenter to blyssyn hym began
And seyde helpe vs seynte frydiswyde
A man wot lytyl what hym schal betyde
This man is falle with hese astronemye
In sum wodnesse or in sum agonye
I thoughte ay wel how þat it schulde be
Men schulde not knowe of goddis priuyte
Ȝe blyssede be alwey a lewede man
That nought but only his bileue can
So ferde a nothyr clerk with astronomye
He walkede in the feldis for to prie
Vp on the sterrys what þere schulde befalle
Til he was in a marbil pyt Ifalle
He say not that but ȝit be seynt Thomays
Me rewyth sore of hende Nycholas
He schal be ratyd of hese stodying
Ȝif that I may be Ihesu heuene kyng
Get me a staf that I may vndyr spore
Whil that þou robyn hevyst vp the dore
He schal out of hese stodyinge as I gesse  
And to the chambere dore he gann hym dresse
Hese knave was a strong carl for the nonys
And by the haspe he haf it of at onys


And in the flor the dore lay anon
This nycholas sat ay as stylle as ston
And euere gapede vpward in to the eyre
This Carpenter wende he hadde 1ben in dispeyre1
And hente hym by the schulderis myghtyly
And shok hym harde and cryede dispitously
What Nicholas what how loke adoun
Awake and thynk on crystis pascioun
I crouche the from elvys and from whitys
Therwith the nyght spel anon ryghtis
On foure haluys of the hous aboute
And on the throsschewald of the dore withoute
Ihesu cryst and seynt benedyt
Blysse this hous from euery wede wygh
ffor the nyghtis verie  the white pater noster
Where wonyst þou now seynte peterys systyr
And at the laste þis hende Nicholas
Gan for to syke sore and seyde allas
Schal al the world ben lost eftsonys now
This carpente answerde what seynst þou
What thynk on god as men don whan þey swinke
This Nicholas answerde fet me drynke
And aftyr wele I speke in priuyte
Of serteyn thyng that touchith me and the
I wele telle it non oþer man certeyn
This carpentyr goth doun and comyth ageyn
And broughte of myghti ale a large quart
And whanne that eche of hem hade dronke his part
This Nicholas hese dore faste schette
And doun the Carpenter by hym he sette
And seyde Ihun myn ost lef and dere
Thow schat vp on thi trouthe swere me here
That to no wyght þou schat þis conseyl wreye  
ffor it is crystis conseyl that I seye
And ȝif þou telle it man þou art forlore
ffor this veniaunce þou schat han þerfore


That ȝif þou wreye me þou schat ben wod
Nay cryst forbede for hese holy blood
Quod þo this selye man I nam no labbe
Ne þow I seye I ne am not lef to gabbe
Sey what þou wylt I schal it neuere telle
To chyld ne wyf by hym that harwede helle
Now Iohn quod Nicholas I nyl not lye
I haue Ifoundyn in myn astronemye
As I haue lokyd in the mone bryght
That now a moneday nest at quarter nyght
Schal falle a reyn and that so wilde and wod
That half so gret was neuere Noyes flod
This world he seyde in more thn an oure
Schal be drenk so hydous is the schour
Thus schal mankynde drenche and lese here lyf
This carpenter answerede allas myn wif
And schal sche drenche allas myn alysoun
ffor sorwe of this he fel almost a doun
And seyde is there no remedye in this cas
Whi ȝis for gode  quod hende Nichola
Ȝif þou wilt werkyn aftyr lore and red
Thow mayst not werkyn aftyr þyn owene red
ffor thus seyth salamon that was for trewe
Werk al be conseyl and þou schalt not rew
And ȝif þou werke wylt be good conseyl
I vndyrtake withoute mast or sayl
Ȝit schal I schaue here and the and me
Hast þou not herd how sauyd was noe
Whan þat oure lord hadde warnede hym beforn
Tha al the word with wayr schulde be lorn
Ȝis quod this carpenter ful ȝore ago
Hast þou not herd quod Nicholas also
The sorwe of Noe with hese felauschepe  
E þan he myghte gete hese wyf to schepe
Hym hadde ben lefere I dar wel vndyrtake
Al thilke tyme than hese wederis blake


That sche hadde had a schep here self a lone
And þerto wost þou what is best to done
This askyth haste and of an hasty thyng
Men may not preche ne make taying
Anon go gete vs faste in to þys in
A knedyng trow or ellys a kemelyng
ffor eche of vs but loke that þey be large
I wheche we mowe sweme as in a barge
And han þerinne vitayle suffyciaunt
But for a day fy on the remenaunt
The watyr schal aslake and gon away
Aboute pryme on the nexte day
But robyn may not wetyn of this thyn knave
Ne ek thym maydyn gille I may not sve
Axe not whi for thow þou axe me
I wele not telle godis priuyte
Suffyseth þe but ȝif thy wit madde
To han as gret a grace as Noe hadde
Thyn wif schal I wel saue out of doute
Go now thyn wey  and sped the here aboute
But whan þou hast for here and þe and me
Igetyn vs these knedyng tubbys thre
Thanne schat þou hangyn hem in the rof ful hye
That no man of oure puruyaunce aspye
And whan þou hast þus don as I haue seyd
And hast oure vitayle fayre in hem leyd
And ek an ax to smyte the corde a two
Whan that the watyr comyth þat we may goo
And breke an hole an hey vp on the gable
Into the gardynward ouer the stabele
That we mowe frely passe forth ore way
Whan that the grete schour is gon away
Than schat þou sweme as merye I vndyrtake  
As doth the white doke aftyr the drake
Thanne wele I clepe how alisoun how Ion
Be merye for the flod wele passe anon


And þou wit seyn heyl maystyr Nicholay
Good morwe for I se þe wel for it is day
And thanne schul we be lordys al oure lyue
Of al the world as Noe was and hese wyue
But of a thyng I warne the ful ryght
Be wel auysed on þat ilke nyght
That we ben enteryd in to schepys bord
That non of vs ne speke not a word
Ne clepe ne crye but ben in hese preyere
ffor it is goddys owene heste dere
Thyn wyf and þou motyn hangyn fer a twen
ffor that betwixe ȝow schal ben no syn
No more in lokynge þan þere schal in dede
This ordenaunce is seyd go god þe spede
To morwe at nyght whan we ben alle aslepe
In to oure knedynge tulbis we schul crepe
And sittynge þere abydynge goddys grace
Go now þyn way I ne haue no lengere space
To make of thys no lengere sarmounnyng
Men seyth þus  synd þe wyse and sey no þyng
Thow art so wys it nedyth þe not teche
Go saue oure lyf and that I þe beseche
This sely carpenter goth forth hese way
fful ofte he seyde allas and welle away
And to hese wif he tolde hese priuyte
And sche was war and knew it bet þan he
What al this queynte cast was for to say
But neuertheles sche ferde as sche wolde day
And seyde allas go forth þyn waye anon
Help vs to skape  er we ben dede eche on

Go dere spouse and help to saue oure lyf
Lo which a gret thyng is affeccyoun  
Men may deye thour Imagynacyoun
So depe may impressioun be take
This sely Carpenter begynnyth to quake


Hym thynkyth verayly þat he may se
Noyous flod come walwynge as the se
To drenchyn alysoun hese hony dere

He sykyth with manye a sory swough
And goth and getyth hym a knedyng trough
And aftyr a tubbe and a kemelyn
And pryuyly he sente hem to hese in
And hyng hem in the rof in priuyte
With his owene hand he made ladderys thre
To klymbyn bi þe roungis and the stalkys
On to the tubbe hangynge in the balkis
And hem vitaylede bothe trow and tubbe
With bred and chese with good alle in a tubbe
Suffysynge rygh Inow as for a day
But er he hadde mad al thys aray
He sente hese knaue and ek hese wenche also
Vp on hese nedis to lundene for to go
And on the moneday whan it drow to nyght
He schette hese dore withoutyn candele lygh
And dressede alle thynge as it schulde be
And schortly vp they clumbe alle thre
They setyn stylle wel a furlong wey
Now pater noster clum seyde Nicholay
And clum quod Ion and clum quod Alysoun
This carpentyr seyde hese deuocyoun
And stylle he sit and biddyth hese preyere
Awaytynge on the reyn ȝif he it here

Aboute corfeu tyme or lyte more

And efft he routyth for hese hed mys lay  
Doun on the laddere stalkyth Nicholay
And Alysoun ful softe a doun sche spedde
Withoutyn wordys mo þey gon to bedde


There as the carpentyr is wone to lye
There was the reuel and the melodye
And þus lyth alysoun and Nycholas
In besynesse of merthe and of solas
Tyl þat the belle of laudis gan to rynge
And frerys in the schaunsel gunne synge
Thys parich clerk this Amerouse Absalon
That is for loue alwey so wo begon
Vp on the moneday was at oseneye
With cumpanye hym to disporte and pleye
And axede vp on cas a cloysterer
fful priuyly aftyr Ion the carpenter
And he drow hym a part out of the cherche
And seyde I saw here not werche
Syn satyrday I trowe that he be went
ffor tymbyr þere oure abbot hath hym sent
ffor he is wont for tymbyr for to go
And dwellyn at the graunge a day or too
Or ell he is at hese hous serteyn
Where that he be I can not sothly seyn
This absalon ful Ioly was and lyght
And thoughte now is tyme to wakyn al nygh
ffor sekyrly I say hym not sterynge
Aboutyn hese dore tyl day began to sprynge
So mot I the I schal at cokkys crowe
fful priuyly knocke at hese wyndowe
That stant ful lowe vndyr hese bourys wal
To alysoun now wele I tellyn al
Myn loue longynge for ȝit I schal not mysse
That at the leste weye I schal here kysse
Sum maner confort schal I haue parfay
Myn mouth hath ȝechid al þis longe day
That is a sygne of kyssynge at the leste  
Al nyght me mette I was at a feste
Therfore I wele go slepe an oure or tweye
And al the nyght þanne wele I wake and pleye


Whan that the ferste Cok hath crowe anon
Vp rist this Ioly louere this absalon
And hym arayeþ gay at poyn deuyse
But fyrst he schewith greyn and licorys
To smelle sote er he hadde kemb his her
Vndyr hese tunge a trewe loue he ber
ffor therby wende he to be gracious
He romyth to the carpenterys hous
And stille he stant vndyr the schot wyndowe
Vn to hese brest it raught it was so lowe
And softe he coude with a semy soun
What do ȝe hony komb ȝe swete alysoun
Myn fayre bryd myn swete synamome
Awakyth leman myn and spekyth to me
Wol lytil thynkyn ȝe vp on myn wo
That for ȝoure loue I swete þere I go
No wondyr ist þow I swalte and swete
I morne as doth a lamb aftyr þe tete
Iwis leman I haue so meche loue longyng
That lik a turtele I trowe is myn mornyng
I may not ete no more þan a mayde
Go from the wyndowe Iakke fol sche sayde
As helpe me god it wele not be cumpame
I loue anothir and ell I were to blame
Wel bet þan þe be Ihesu Absalon
Go forth þyn way or I wele caste a ston
And let me slepe a twenty dele wey
Allas quod absalon and welleawey
That trewe loue was euere so euele beset
Than kys me syn it may be no bet
ffor Ihesus loue and for the loue of me
Wilt þou þanne go thyn wey therewith quod sche
Ȝa certis lemman quod þis absalon  
Thanne mak þe redi quod sche I come anon
    
    
This Absalon sette hym doun on hese kneis


And seyde I am a lord at alle degreis
ffor aftyr this I hope þere comyth more
leman thyn grace and swete bryd þyn ore
The wyndowe sche ondoth and that in haste
Haue don quod sche come of and sped þe faste
Lest that thyn neyhebouris þe aspye
This absalon gan wype his mouth ful drye
Derk was the nyght as pouche or as the cole
And out at the wyndowe sche putte here ars hole
And absalon fel neyþer bet noþer wers
But with hese mouth he kyste here nakede ars
fful sauourly er he were war of this
A bakke he styrte and thouthe it was a mys
ffor wel he wiste a woman hadde no berd
He felte a thyng al row and long Iheryd
And seyde fy allas what haue I do
Te he quod sche and claptte here wyndowe to
And absalon goth forth a sory pas
A berd a berd quod hynde Nicholas
Bi goddis corpus this goth fayre and wel
This sely absalon herde euerydel
And on his lippe he gan for angyr bite
And to hym self he seyde I schal þe quyte
Who rubbyth now ho frotyth now hese lippis
With dust with sond with straw with cloth with schippis
But absolon þat seyth ful ofte allas
Myn soule betake I onto saternas
But me were betere þan al this toun quod he
Of þis dispyt awrokyn for to be
Allas quod he allas why ne hadde I bleynt
Hese hote loue was cold and al Iqueynt
ffor from that tyme that he hadde kyst his ers
Of paramour he sette not a kres
ffor he was heled of hese maladye  
fful ofte paramouris he gan defye
And wepte as doth a chyld þat is Ibete
A softe pas he wente ouer the strete


Vn tyl a smyth men clepedyn daun Ieruys
That in hese forge he smethede plow harneys
He scharpith schar and cultyr besyly
This absalon knokyth al besyly
And seyde ondo Geruays and þat anon
What ho art þou it am I Absalon
What Absalon what crystis swete tre
Whi ryse ȝe so rathe ey benedicyte
What eylyth ȝow sum gay gerl god it wot
Hath brouȝt ȝow þus vp on the merytot
This Absolon ne roughte not a bene
Be seynte note ȝe wete wel what I mene
Of al this pley no word he ne spak
He hadde more tow on hese rak
Whan geruays knew and seyde fren so dere
That hote cultyr in the chemene here
As lene it me I haue þerwith to done
I wele bryngyn it þe ageyn ful sone
Gerueys answerede sertis were it gold
Or in a poke nobellys al ontold
Thu schuldyst haue as I am trewe smyth
Ey cristis foo what wele ȝe do þerwith
Therof quod Alsalon be as be may
I schal wel telle it þe to morwe day
And caughte þe cultyr by the colde stele
fful softe out at þe dore hym gan stele
And wente vnto þe carpenterys wal
He knokyth fyrst and kallyth þerwithal
Vp on þe wyndowe rygh as he dede er
This alysoun answerde ho is ther
That knokyst so I warent the a thef
Why nay quod he god wot myn swete lef
I am thyn absalon myn derelyng  
Of gold quod he I haue þe brought a ryng
Myn modyr ȝaf it me so god me saue
fful fyn it is and þerto wel Igraue


This wele I ȝeuen þe ȝif I þe kysse
This Nicholas was resyn for to pysse
And thoute he wolde amendyn al þe Iape
He schulde kysse hese ars er þan he spake
And vp the wyndowe dede he hastyly
And out hese ars he puttyth pryuyly
Ouer the buttok  to þe haunche bon
And þerwith spak this absolon
Spek swete brid I not where þou art
This Nicholas anon let flye a fart
As gret as it hadde ben a thondyr dent
And with þe strok he was almost Iblent
And he was redy with hese yryn hot
And Nicholas a mydde þe ars he smot
Off goth the skyn  an hande brede aboute
The hote cultyr  brende so hese toute
And for the smert he wende for to deye
As he were wod  for wo he gan to crye
Help watyr watyr  help for godys herte
This carpenter  out of hese slombir sterte
And herde on cryen  watyr as he were wod
And thoughte allas now comyth Newel flod
He sit hym vp withoute wordys mo
And with hese ax  he smette the corde on to
A doun he fel he fond no thyng to selle
Neyþer bred ne ale  Ne no thyng elle
Vp on the flor  and þere aswounne he lay
Vp styrte here Alysoun and nycholay
And cryedyn out  harrow in the strete
The neygheborys boþe smale and grete
In ronne for to gauryn on þis man
That ȝit a swounne he lay boþe pale and wan
ffor with that fal he brusten hath his arme  
But stonden he must vnto his owne harme
ffor whanne he spak he was anoon bore doun
With hynde Nicholas and Alisoun


Thei tolde euery man that he was wood
He was agast so of the Nowels flood
Thurgh fantasie that of his vanyte
He hadde bought hym kneding tubbes three
And hadde hem hanged in the roof aboue
And that he praiede hem for goddis loue
To sitten in the roof par companye
The folk gan laughwen at his fantasie
And to the roof thei kiken and thei gape
And turned al his harm vnto a Iape
ffor what this carpentere answerde
It was for nought no man his resoun herde
With othes gret he was sworne adoun
That he was holden wood in al that toun
ffor euery clerk anoon right helde with other
Thei seide the man is wood my leue brother
And euery wight gan laughwen at his stryf
Thus swyued was the carpenters wyf
ffor al his kepyng and his Ialousie  
And Absolon hath kist hir nethir ye
And Nicholas is scaldid in his toute
This tale is don and god saue al the route
WHanne folk han laughwen at this nyce cas
Of Absolon and hynde Nicholas
Dyuerse folk dyuersely they seide
But for the more part thei lough and pleyde
Ne at this tale I saw no man him greue
But it were oonly Oswold the Reue
By cause he was of Carpenteres craft
A litel ire is in his herte laft
He gan to grucche and blamede it a lite
So the yk quod he ful wel kouthe I ȝou quite
With blering of a proude mellers ye
If that me list to speke of rybaudye
But yk am old me list not pleye for age
Gras tyme is don my foddere is forage
This white top writeth myn olde ȝeres
Myn herte is al so mouled as myn heres
But if I fare as doth an openers
That ilk fruyt is euere lenger the wers
Til it be roten in mullok or in stree
We olde men I drede so fare we
Til we be roten can we nought be ripe
We hoppen alweye while the world wil pipe
ffor in oure wille ther stiketh euere a naile
To haue an hoor her  and a grene taile
As hath a leek  for though oure might be gon
Oure wille desireth folye euere in oon
ffor whanne we may nought don than wil we speke
Ȝit in oure asshen old is fire reke
ffoure gledes haue we whiche I shal diuise
Auauntyng  liyng  Angre  Coueitise
These foure sparkles longith vnto elde  
Oure olde lymes mowe wel be vnwelde


But wille ne shal not failen that is soth
And ȝit haue I alwey a coltes toth
As many a ȝere as it is passed henne
Sith that my tappe of lyf bigan to renne
ffor sekyrly whan I was boryn anon  
Deth drow þe tappe of lyf and let it gon
And euere sithe hath so þe tappe Ironne
Til þat almost al emty is þe tunne
The strem of lyf now droppith on þe chymbe
The sely tunge may wel rynge and chymbe
Of wrechedenesse þat passede is ful ȝore
With olde folk saue dotage is no more
Whan þat þe ost hadde herd this sarmounnyng
He gan to spek as lordly as a kyng
He seyde what amountyth al þis wit
What schul we speke al day of holy writ
The deuyl made a reue for to preche
And of a soutere schipman or a leche
Sey forth thyn tale and tarye not þe tyme
Lo Depeforthe and it is half weye pryme
Lo Grenewych þere manye a schrewe is inne
It were hey tyme þyn tale to begynne
Now serys quod this Osowold the reue
I preye ȝow alle þat ȝe nat ȝow greue
Thow I answere and sumdel sette hese howe
ffor lefful it is þat forse  forse of schowe
This dronkene mellere hath Itold vs here
How þat begiled was a carpentere
Parauenture in scorn for I am on
And by ȝoure leue I schal ȝow quyte anon
Ryght in hese cherlis termys wele I speke
I preye to god his nelke mote breke
He can wel in myn eye sen a stalke
But in hese owene he can not sen a balke

AT Trompyngtoun not fer fram cantabregge  
Þere goth a brok and ouer þat a bregge
Vp on þe which brok þer stant a melle
And this is veray soth þat I ȝou telle
A mellere was þer dwellynge many a day
As ony pekok he was proud and gay
Pype he coude and fyssche and netys beete
And turne cuppis and wel wrestele and schete
Ay by hese belte he bar a long panade
And of a swerd ful trenchaunt was the blade
A Ioly poppere bar he in hese pouche
Ther was no man for peryl durste hym touche
A sheffeld Thwytel bar he in hese hose
Round was hese face and kammede was hese nose
As pelyd as an ape was hese skolle
He was a markat betere at þe fulle
There durste no wygh hand vp on hym leye
That he ne swor þat he schulde anon abeye
A thef he was for sothe of corn and mele
And þat a sly and vsaunt for to stele
And his name was hotyn deynous symkyn
A wif he hadde comyn of noble kyn
The persoun of the toun here fadyr was
With here he ȝaf ful many a peny of bras
ffor þat Symkyn schulde in hese blod alye
Sche was fostered in a nunnerye
ffor Symkyn wolde no wyf as he seyde
But sche were wel Inoryschid and a mayde
To sauyn hese estat of ȝemanrye
And sche was proud and pert as is a pye
A ful fayr syghte was it on hem to
On holye dayis beforn here wolde he ge


With hese typet boundyn aboutyn hese hed
And sche come aftyr in a gite of red
And symkyn hadde hosyn of the same
Ther durste no wygh clepyn here but dame
Was non hardy þat wente be þe weye  
That durste with here rage or onys pleye
But ȝif he wolde be slayn of symkyn
With panade or knyf or boytekyn
ffor Ielous folk ben perelous euere mo
Algate þey wolde here wyuys wenden so
And ek for sche was sumwhat smotyrlych
Sche was as dygne as watyr In a dich
And ful of hokyr and of bismerye
Sche thoughte þat a lady schulde here spareye
What for here kynrede and here Norterye
That sche hadde lerned in þe nunnerye
A doughtyr hadde þey betwixe hem too
Of twenty ȝer withoutyn ony moo
Sauynge a chyld þat was of sene ȝer age
In cradil it lay and was a propere page
This wenche thikke and wel Igrowyn was
With cammuse nose and eyen greye as glas
Buttokkys brode and brestis rounde and hye
But rygh fayr was here her I wele not lye
This persoun of the toun for sche was so fayr
In purpos was to makyn here hese eyr
But of hese catel and hese mesewage
And straunge he made it of here maryge
Hese purpos was for to bestowe here hye
In to sum worthi blod of aunceterye
ffor holicherche good  mote ben dispendit
On holy cherchis blod  þat is dessendit
Þerfore he wolde  hese holy blod honoure
Thow þat he holy cherche  schulde devoure
Gret sokene hath  this mellere out of doute
With whete and malt  of al the lond aboute


And namely þere was a gret college
Men clepyth þe soler halle at cantebrege
There was heyre whete and here malt Igrounde
And on a day it happede in a stounde
Sek lay þe mauncypele on a malady  
Men wendyn wisely þat he schulde dey
ffor which this mellere stal bothe mele and corn
An hundere tyme more þan beforn
ffor þere beforn he stal but curteysly
But now he was a thef outragyously
ffor whych þe wardeyn schod and made fare
But therof sette this mellere not a tare
He crakyth bost and swor it was not so
Þanne were there pore clerkys too
That dwelledyn in þis halle of whiche I seyde
Testyf þey were and lusty for to pleye
And only for here myrthe and reuerye
Vp on þe wardeyn besily þey crye
To ȝeue hem leue but a lite stounde
To gon to melle  to sen here corn Igrounde
And hardely þey durste leyn here nekke
The mellere schulde not stele hem half a pekke
Of corn be sleyghte ne be forse hem reue
And at þe laste þe wardeyn ȝaf hem leue
Ion highte þat on and aleyn hyghte þat oþer
Of on toun were þey born þat hyghte strother
ffer in the north I can not tellyn where
This aleyn makyth redy al hese gere
And on an hors he caste þe sak anon
Forth goth aleyn þe clerk and also Ion
With good swerd and bokeler bi here syde
Ion knew þe weye hem nedyth no gyde
And at þe melle þe sak adoun he leyth
Aleyn spak fyrst alheyl symound in feyth
How farys þyn fayre douȝtyr and thyn wif
Aleyn wolcome quod symkyn be myn lyf


And Iohn also how now what do ȝe here
Symond quod Iohn bi god nede has no pere
He muste serue hym self þat has no sweyn
Or ellis he is a fol as clerkis seyn
Oure maunciple I hope he wele be ded  
Swa werkis ay  þe wangis in hese hed
And þerfore is I come and ek aleyn
To grynde oure corn and carie it hom ageyn
I prey ȝow spede vs hene as ȝe may
It schal be don quod symkyn be myn fay
What wel ȝe don whil þat it is in hande
By god ryȝt by þe hopyr wele I stande
Quod Ion and sen how þe corn goth in
Ȝit saw I neuere be myn fadir kyn
How þat þe hopir wagis to and fra
Aleyn answerede and seyde wist þou swa
Thanne wele I be beneth bi myn croun
And sen how þat þe mele fallyth don
In to þe trow þat schal ben myn dysport
ffor Iohn yfayth I may ben of ȝore sort
I is as ille a mellere as is ȝe
This mellere smylede of here nysetee
And thouȝte al þis it nys don but for a wyle
They wene þat no man may hem begyle
But be myn thryft  ȝit wele I blere here ye
ffor al þe sleyȝte in here philosofye
The more queynte crokede þat þey make
The more wele I stele whan I take
In stede of flour  ȝit wele I ȝeue hēm bren
The gretteste clerkys ben not wyseste men
As whilom to þe wolf þus spak þe mare
Of al here art I counte not a tare
Out at þe dore he goth ful pryuyly
Whan þat he saw hese tyme softely
He lokyth vp and doun tyl he haue founde
The clerkys hors þere as it stod Ibounde


Behynde þe melle vndyr a leuesel
And to þe hors he goth fayre and wel
He strepith of þe brydil ryght anon
And whan þe hors was los he gynnyth gon
Toward þe fen þere wilde marys renne  
And forth with wehe þour theke and thorw thenne
This mellere gooth aȝen  no word he seyde
But doth his note and with þe clerkis pleyede
Til þat here corn was wel and fayre grounde
And whan þe mele is salkyd and Ibounde
This Iohn goth out and fynt his hors away
And gan to crye harow and weyleaway
Oure hors is lorn aleyn for godys bonys
Step on thyn foot Aleyn come of atonys
Allas oure wardeyn has hese palfrey lorn
This aleyn forgat bothe mele and corn
Al was out of hese mynde hese hosebondrye
What whedir is he gon he gan to crye
The wyf cam lepynge inward with a ren
Sche seyde alas ȝoure hors goth to þe fen
Wyth wylde marys as faste as sche may go
Vnthank come on hese hand þat bond hym so
And he þat betere schulde a knyt þe reyne
Allas quod aleyn for crystis peyne
Ley doun þyn swerd  and I wele myn al swa
I is ful wyȝt god woot as is a raa
By goddis herte  he schal nat skape vs baþe
Whi ne haddist þou pit þe capyl in þe lathe
Ille hayl aleyn be god þou is a fonne
These sely clerkis han ful faste Ironne
Toward þe fen  bothe aleyn and ek Iohn
And whan þe mellere saw þat þey were gon
He half a buschel of here flour hath take
And bad hese wif gon knede it in a kake
He seyde I trowe þe clerkys were aferyd
Ȝit can a mellere make a clerkys berd


ffor al here art now lat hem gon here woye
Lo where he goth þat lat þe childeryn pleye
They gete hym not so lyȝtely  be myn croun
These sely clerkys rennen vp and doun
Wyth kep kep  stand stand stand Iossa ware þe rere  
Ga whystele thow and I schal kepe hymm here
But schortly til þat it was veray nyght
They coude not Thow they don al here myȝt
Here capil cache he ran al wey so faste
Tyl in a dych þey caughte hym at þe laste
Wery and wet as beste is in þe reyn
Comyth sely ion and with hym comyth aleyn
Allas quod Iohn þe day þat I was born
Now are we dreuyn tyl hethng and to scorn
Oure corn is stole men wele vs folys calle
Boþe þe wardayn and oure felas alle
And namely þe mellere weyleawey
Thus pleynyth Iohn as he goth be þe wey
Toward þe melle  and bayard in hese hond
The mellere sittynge by þe fyr he fond
ffor it was nyȝt and ferþere myȝte þey nought
But for þe loue of god þey hym besought
Of herberwe and of ese for here peny
The mellere seyde ageyn ȝif þere be eny
Swich as it is ȝit schal ȝe haue ȝoure part
Myn hous is streyt but ȝe han lernede art
Ȝe cunne with argumentis make a place
A myle brod of twenty fote of space
Let se now ȝif þis space may suffyse
Or make it roum with speche as is ȝoure gyse
Now symond seyde Iohn be seynt Cutbert
Ay art þou merye and þis is fayre answeryd
I haue herd seyd men schal tan of too thyngis
Swich as he fynd or take swich as he bryngis
But specially I preye þe hoot and deere
Gete vs sum mete and drynk and make vs chere


And we wele paye trewely at þe folle
With emty hand men may none haukys tolle
Lo here oure syluyr  redy for to spende
This mellere in to þe tounne hese doughtyr sende
ffor ale and bred and rostede hem a goos  
And bond here hors it schulde not gon loos
And in hese owene chaumbir made a bed
With schetis and with chalounnys fayre Ispred
Not from his owene bed ten fote or twelve
Hese douȝtyr hadde a bed al by here selue
Rygh in þe same schaumbyr by and by
It myȝte ben no bet and cause why
There was non roumere herberw in þe plase
The soupe and þey speke hem to solase
And dronkyn ay strong ale at þe beste
Aboute medenyȝt wente þey to reste
Wel hath this mellere vernychid hese hed
fful pale he was fordrunke and not red
He ȝyksneth and spekyth þourw þe nose
As he were on þe quakke or on þe pose
To bedde he goþ and with hym goth his wif
As ony iay sche lyȝt was and iolyf
So was here ioly whistele wel Iwet
The cradil at here beddys feet is set
To rokke and to ȝeue þe child to souke
And whan þat dronkyn al was in þe crouke
To bedde wente þe douȝtyr ryȝt anon
To bedde goth aleyn and ek Iohn
Ther nas no mor hem neded no dwale
This mellere hath so wysely bibbit alle
That as an hors he snortyth in hese slep
Ne of hese tayl ne takyth he no kep
Hese wif bar hym a burdoun a ful strong
Men myȝtyn here hyre route too furlong
The wenche routyth ek par cumpaynye
Aleyn þe clerk þat herde þis melodye


He pokede ion and seyde slepist þou
Herdist þou euere swich a song er now
Lo swich a copil is among hem alle
A wylde fyr mote on here bodyis falle
Ho herkenyth euere swich a ferly thyng  
Ȝa þey schal haue þe flour of ille endyng
This longe nyȝt þere tydis me no reste
But ȝit no fors al schal ben for the beste
ffor Iohn seyde he as euere mote I thryue
Ȝif þat I may þe wenche wele I schryue
Sum esement has lawe Ischapyn vs
ffor Iohn þere is a lawe þat says þus
That ȝif a man in a poynt be agreuyd
That in a noþer he schal ben releuyd
Oure corn is stolin schortly it is non nay
And we han had an ille fit al þis day
And syn I schal han non amendement
Ageyn my los I wele haue eysement
By godys sale it schal non oþer be
This Iohn answerde Aley avise þe
The mellere is a perlyous man he seyde
And ȝif þat he out of hese slep abreyde
He myȝte vs don bothe a velanye
Alyn answerde I counte hym not a flye
And vp he sterte and by þe wenche he crepte
This wenche lay vp ryght and faste slepte
Tyl he so nygh was er sche myghte aspye
That it hadde be to late for to crye
And schortely for to seyn þey were at on
Now pley aleyn for I wele speke of ion
This Iohn lyth stylle a furlong wey or too
And to hym self he makyth reuthe and woo
Allas quod he þis is a wekede iape
Now may I seyn þat I is but an ape
Ȝit hath myn felawe sumwhat for hese harm
He has þe melleris douȝtyr in hese arm


He auntered hym and has hese nedis sped
And I lye as a draf sek in myn bed
And whan þis iape is told a noþer day
I schal ben told a daffe a cokenay
I wele ryse and antere it be myn fay  
Vnhardi is vnsely þus men say
And vp he ros and softely he wente
Vn to þe cradil and in hese hond it hente
And bar it softe vn to hese bedis feet
Sone aftyr þis þe wyf here routyng let
And gan to wake and lefte for to pysse
And cam ageyn and gan here cradil mysse
And gropede here and þere  but sche fond non
Allas quod sche I hadde almost mys gon
I hadde al most gon to þe clerkys bed
Ey benedyste þanne hadde I foule Isped
And forth sche goth tyl sche þe cradel fond
Sche gropede alwey ferþere with here hond
And fond þe bed and thouȝte not but good
Be cause þat þe cradyl by it stod
And nyste where sche was for it was derk
And fayre and wel sche crep in bi þe clerk
And lyth ful stylle and wolde a cauȝt a slep
Withinne a while þis Iohn vp lep
And on þis goode wif he leyth on sore
So merye a fit ne hadde sche ful ȝore
He prikyth harde and sore as he were mad
This ioly lyf han þese too klerkis lad
Tyl þat þe fyrste kok began to synge
Aleyn wex wery in þe dawenynge
ffor he hadde swonkyn al þe longe nyȝt
And seyde farwel malyn swete wyȝt
The day is come I may no lengere byde
But euere more where so I go or ryde
I is þyn owene clerk so haue I sel
Now dere leman quod sche go fare weel


But er þou go on thyng I wele þe telle
Whan þat þou wendyst homward be þe melle
Ryȝt at þe entre of þe dore behynde  
Þou schat a cake of half a buschel fynde
Þat was Imakyd ryȝt of þyn owene mele
Which þat I halp myn fadyr for to stele
And goode leman god þe saue and kepe
And with þat word sche gan almost to wepe
Aleyn vp ryst and thoughte er þan it dawe
I wele gon crepe in by myn felawe
And fond þe cradyl with hese hand anon
By god þouȝte he al wrong I haue mys gon
Myn hed is toty of myn swynk to nyȝt
Þat makyth me þat I go not aryȝt
I wot wel by þe cradyl I haue mys go
Here lyth þe mellere and hese wyf also
And forth he goth a twenty deleway
Vn to þe bed þere þat þe mellere lay
He wende a crepid bi hese felawe Ion
An by þe mellere in he crepede anon
And cauȝte hym by þe nekke softe he spak
He seyde þou Iohn þou sweuenyst awak
ffor cristis soule and here a nobele game
ffor by þat lord þat called is seynt Iame
As I haue thryes in þe schorte nyȝt
Swyuyd þe melleris douȝtyr bolt vp ryȝt
Whil þou hast as a coward been agast
Ȝa false harlot quod þe mellere hast
A false traytour false clerk quod he
Thow schat ben ded be godis dynete
Ho durste ben so bold to disparage
Myn douȝtyr þat is comyn of swych lenage
And by the throte bolle he caughte aleyn
And he hente hym dyspitously ageyn
And on þe nose he smot hym with hese fest
Doun ran þe blod strem vp on hese brest


And in þe floor with nose and mouth tobroke
They walwe as don too piggis in a poke
And vp þey gon and don ageyn anon  
Tyl þat þe mellere spurnede aȝen a ston
And doun he fyl bakward vp on hese wif
That wiste no þyng of þis nyse stryf
ffor sche was falle a slepe a lyte wyght
With Iohn þe clerk þat wakede al nyȝt
And with þe fal out of here slep sche bryde
Help holy croys of bromeholm sche seyde
In manus tuas lord to þe I calle
Awake symond þe fend is on vs falle
Myn herte is brokyn allas I ne am but ded
There lyth on vp on myn wombe and on myn hed
Help symkyn for þe false klerkys fyȝte
This Iohn styrte vp as faste as euere he myȝte
And graspith by the walle to and fra
To fynde a staf and sche styrte vp alswa
And knew þe estis betere þan dede þis Iohn
And bi þe wal a staf sche fond anon
And saw a lytyl schemeryng of a lyȝt
ffor at an hole in schon þe mone bryt
And by þat lyȝt sche say hem boþe too
But sekyrly sche nyste ho was who
But as sche say a whit thyng in here eye
And whan sche gan þe whyte þyng espye
Sche wende þe clerk hadde wered a wolyper
And with the staf sche drow ay ner and ner
And wende an hit þes aleyn at þe fulle
And smot þe mellere on þe pylede sculle
And doun he goth harow I deye
These clerkys bete hym wel and lete hym lye
And hastede hem and toke here leue anon
And ek here mele and on here woye þey gon
And at þe melle ȝit þey toke here kake
Of half a buschel flour wol wel Ibake


Thus is þe proude mellere wel Ibete
And hath Ilost the gryndyng of þe wete
And payed for þe souper euery del  
Of aleyn and of Iohn þat bete hym wel
Hese wyf is swyuyd and hese doughtyr als
Lo swich It is a mellere to ben fals
And þerfore this prouerbe is seyd ful soth
Hym thar not wene wel þat euele doth
A gylour schal hym self begylede be
And god þat settyth hye in mageste
Save all þese cumpanyis grate and smale
Thus haue I quit þe mellere in myn tale
THe cook of lundene whil þe reue spak
ffor ioye hym thouȝte he clawede hym on þe bak
Ha ha ha for cristys passyoun
This mellere hadde a scharp conclusyoun
Vp on his argument of herbergage
Wel seyde salamon  on his langage
Ne brynge not euery with in to þyn hous
ffor herberwynge be nyȝte is perlyous
Wel auȝte a man avysede for to be
Whom þat he brouȝte in to hese priuyte
I preye to god so ȝeue me sorwe and care
Syn euere I highte hoge of ware
Herde I euere a mellere betere Iset a werke
He hadde a Iape of maleys in þe derke
But god forbede þat we stentyn here
And þerfore ȝif ȝe wouche saf to here
A tale of me þat am a pore man
I wele ȝow telle as wel as euere I can
A lytyl Iape what fel in oure cete
Oure ost answerde and seyde I graunte it þe
Now telle on roger and loke þat it be good
ffor manye a paste hast þou letyn blod
And manye a rakke of douere hast þou sold
That hath ben twyes hot and twyes cold  
Of manye a pilgrym hast þou cristis curs
ffor of thyn persele ȝit thy fare þe wers
That þey han etyn with thyn stobil goos
ffor in thyn schoppe is manye a flye los
Now telle on gentyl roger be þyn name
But ȝit I preye þe be not wroth for game
A man may sey ful soth in game and play
Thow seyst ful soth quod roger be myn fay


But sooth pley quaad pley as þe flemyng seyth
And þerfore herry bayly be þyn feyth
Be þou not wroth er we partyn here
Thow þat myn tale be of an ostelere
But natheles I wele nat telle it ȝet
But er we parte Iwis þou schat be quit
And þerwithal he low and made chere
And seyde hese tale as ȝe schal aftyr here
A Prentis whilom dwellid in oure citee  
And of a craft of vitalers was he
Gaillard he was as golfynche in þe schawe
Broun as bery a proper short felawe
With lokkes blake Ikempt ful fetisly
Daunce he kouþe so wel and Iolyly
That he clepid perkyn reueilloure
He was as ful of loue and paramour
As is þe hive ful of hony swete
Wel was þe wenche with him myght mete
At euery bridale wold he synge and hoppe
He louede bette þe tauerne þan þe shoppe
ffor whan þer any ridynge was in chepe  
Out of þe Shoppe þeder wold he lepe
Til þat he had al þe sight Iseyn
And daunced wel wold he not come agayne
And gedrid hym mony of his sort
To hoppe and synge and make suche disport
And þere þey setten steuene for to mete
To pleyn at þe dys in suche a strete
ffor in þe toun nas ner no prentis
That fairer couþe cast a peyre of dys
Then perkyn couth and þerto he was free
Of his dispence in place of pryuyte
That fonde his maister wel in his chaffare
ffor ofte tyme he fonde his box ful bare
ffor sikirly a prentis reuelour
    
His maystir shuld it in his shep abye
Al haue not part of þe mynstralcie
ffor theft and riot þei ben conuertible
Al can he pleye on geterne or rubible


Reuel and trouth as in lowe degree
They ben ful wroth al day as men may see
This Iolye prentis with his mayster boode
Til he were nyghe oute of his prentishoode
Al were he snybbit erly and late
And somtyme lad with Reuel to Newgate
But at last his maystir him byþoght
Vpon a day whan he his paper sought
Of a prouerbe þat saith þis same word
Wel bet is roten appel oute of hoorde
Than þat it rotet alle þe remenant
So farith it by a ryocous seruant
It is ful lasse harme to late hym passe
Than he shend alle þe seruauntz in þe place
Therfore his maystir ȝaf him a quytaunce
And bade him go with sorow and myschaunce
And þus this Ioly prentis had his leuee  
Now let hym Riot al þe nyght or leue
And for ther is no theof withoute a loke
That helpith hym to wasten and to sowke
Of þat he bribe can or borow may
Anoon he sent his bede and his array
Vn to a couper of his owne soort
That loued dys Reuel and disport
And had a wif þat held for contynaunce
A shope and swyfed for hir sustynaunce
oure Oste saugh well that the bright sonne
The arke of his artaficiall day had ronne
The fourthe parte and half an houre and more
And though he were not deep experte in lore
He wist it was the xviij day
Of Aprill that is messager to May
And saugh well that the schadow of euery tre
Was as in lengthe the same quantite
That was the body erecte that causid it
And þerfore by þe schadewe he tok hese wit  
That phebus which þat schon so cler and bryȝt
Degreis fyue and forty Iclombe on hyȝt
And for þat day as in þat latytude
It was ten of þe clok he gan conclude
And sodeynly he plyȝte hese hors aboute
Lordyngis quod he I warne ȝow al þis route
The fourte party of þis day is gon
Now for þe loue of god and seynt Iohn
Leseth no tyme as fer forth as ȝe may
Lordyngis it wastyth nyȝt and day
And stelyth from vs what priuyly slepynge
And what þerwith neclygence In oure wakynge
As doth þe strem þat turnyth neuere ageyn
Dessendynge from þe monteyn Into pleyn
Wel can senykeke and manye a phylisofere
Bewaylyn tyme more þan gold in cofere
ffor los of catel may recouerede be
But los of tyme schendyth vs quod he


It wele not come ageyn withoutyn drede
No more þan wele malkenys maydynhede

Thus wele oure tyxt  but natheles serteyn

That Chaucer thoughte he can but lewedely
On metris and on rymyng craftyly
As seyde hem in swich engelych as he can
Of olde tyme as knowyth manye a man
And ȝif he haue not seyde hem leue broþer
In on bok he hath seyd hem in a noþer

Mo þan ouyde made of mencyoun 
In hese epistell þat ben ful olde
What schulde I telle hem syn þat þey ben tolde

And syþe haþ he spoke of euerychon
These nobele wyuys and þese loueris ek
Who so þat wole hese large volum sek

There may he se þe large woundis wyde
Of lucresse and of babiloyn Tisbee

Of adryane and of Isiphilee

Of brixseyde and of þe ladomya

O ypermystre penolopee Alceste

But serteynly no word wrytyh he
Of thilk ensaumple of Canacee
That louede here owene broþer synfully
Of swiche cursede storyis I seye fy

Byrafte hys douȝtir hir Maydenhede

Whan he hir þrowe þorough þe pament
And þfore he of full avisement
Wolde nevere write in none of his sermones
Of whiche vnkynde abhomynacions

But of my tale how shalle doo þis day

And with þat worde he with a sobre chere

Ȝe sechen londe and See for your wynnynges
As wyse folkes þat knowen alle þe staat 
Of regnes ye ben fadres and tydynges
And tales bothen of pees and debate

Nere þat a marchaunt goon ys many ·a· yeere
Me taught a tale whiche as · ȝe shal here
This senatourys wif hyre aunte was
But for al þat sche knew hyre neuere þe more
I wele no lengere taryen in þis cas
But to kyng alla which I spak of ȝore
That for his wyf wepith and sykyth sore
I wele returne and lete I wele custaunce
Vndyr þe senatourys gouernaunce
In Surry whilom dwellede a cmpaignye  
Of chapmen riche and þerto sadde and trewe
That wide where sentyn here spicerye
Clothis of gold and satynys ryche of hewe
Here chaffare was so thrifty and so newe
That euery wight hath deynte to chaffare
With hem and ek to sellen hem here ware
Now fil it that þe maysteris of þat sort
Han shapyn hem to rome for to wende
Were it for chapmanhod or for disport
Non oþer message wolde he dedyr sende
But comyn hem self to rome þis is thende
And in swich place as thoghte hem thawauntage
ffor hire entent þey take hire herbergage
Soiournyd han þese marchauntis in þat toun
A serteyn tyme as fel to here plesaunce
But so befel þat thexselent renoun
Of themperourys doghter dame Custaunce
Reportid was with euery circumstance
Vnto thys surryne marchantys in swich wise
ffrom day to day as I schal ȝow deuyse
This was the comune voys of euery man
Oure emperoure of rome god hym se
A doughtir hath þat syn þe world began
To rekene as wel here goodnes as here beute
Was neuere swich anoþer as is sche
I preye to god in honour here sustene
And wolde sche were of al Europe þe quene


In here is high beute withoute pryde
Ȝouthe withoute grenehede or folye
To alle here werkys vertu is here gyde
Humblesse hath slayn in here al tyrannye
Sche is myrour of alle curteysye
Here herte is verray chambyr of holynesse
Hire hand mynystre of fredom for almesse
And al þis voys was soth as god is trewe  
But now to purpos lat vs turne ageyn
These marchantys han don frauȝt here schepis newe
And whan þey han þis blysful maydyn seyn
Hom to surry ben þey went ful feyn
And on here nedys as þey don ful ȝore 
And lyuen in wele I can sey ȝow no more
Now fil it þat these marchantys stode in grace
Of hym þat was þe soudon of surrye
ffor whan þey come from ony strange place
He wolde of hese benygne curteysye
Make hem good cher and besyly espye
Tydyngis of sundery regnys for to lere
The wonderis þat he myghte sen or here
Amongis oþere thyngis specially
These marchauntis han hym told of dame Custaunce
So gret noblesse in ernest certeynly
That this soudan hath cauȝt so gret plesaunce
To han hyre fygure in hese remembraunce
And al hese lust and al hese besy cure
Was for to loue here whil his lyf may dure
Perauenture in thilke large boke
Which þat clepid is þe heuene Iwretyn was
With sterrys whan þat he hese berthe tok
That he for loue schulde han hese deth allas


ffor in þe sterris clerere than is glas
Is wrete god wot ho so coude it rede
The deth of euery man  with outyn any drede
In sterrys manye a wyntyr there beforn
Was wretyn þe deth of ector achilles
Of pompeye Ielyus er þey were born
The stryf of thebes and of hercules
Of sampson Thurnus and of socrates
The deth but menys wittys ben so dulle
That no with can wel rede it at þe fulle
This soudon for hese priuy conseyl sente  
And schortely of þis matiere for to pace
He hath to hem declarede his entente
And seyde serteyn but he myȝte han grace
To han custaunce withinne a lytyl space
He nas but ded and chargede hem in hye
To schapyn for hese lyf sum remedye
Dyuerse men dyuerse thyngys seydyn
They argumentyn and castyn vp and doun
Manye a subtyle resoun forth þey leydyn
They spekyn of Magyk and Abusioūn
But fynally as in conclusioun
They can not sen in that non auantage
Ne in non othir woye saue maryage
Thanne sawe they þerin swich difficulte
Be weye of resoun for to speke al pleeyn
Be cause þere was  swich dyuercyte
Betwethyn here bothe lawys þat þey seyn
They trowede that no crystene prynce wolde fayn
Weddyn his chyld vndyr oure lawys swete

Sauyth myn lyf and beth nat recheles

And in encres of Crystes lawe dere

How þat the soudan and hese baronage  
And alle hese lyges schulde cristenede be
And he schal haue custaunce in maryage
And serteyn gold I not what quantyte
And heer to fyndyn sufficient suretee
This same acord was sworn on eyþer syde
Now fayre Custaunce almyȝty god ȝow gyde
Now wolde sum men waytyn as I gesse
Ȝit I schulde telle al þe puruyaunce
That þe emperour of his greete noblesse
Hath schapyn for hese doughtur dame Custaunce
Wel may men knowe þat so gret ordenaunce
May no man telle in swich a lytyl clause
As was arayed for so high a cause
Byschopis ben schapyn with here for to wende

And oþere folk Inowe this is the ende
And notyfyed is thorw out þe toun

Schulde preye crist þat he this maryage

So ȝeue me grace hese hestis to fulfylle

And to ben vndyr manys gouernaunce

Or ylion brende at thebes the cetee

And hastiliche þis soudan sente hese sonde

And seyde hese wyf was comyn out of doute
And preyede hire to ryde aȝen þe quene

Of surreynys and romeynys met in fere

Receyuyth hire with also glad a chere
As any modir myȝte hire douȝtyr dere
And to þe nexte sete þere be syde
A softe pas solempnely þey ryde
Noght trowe I þe triumphe of Iulius
Of which þat lucan makyth swich a bost
Was royallere ne more curyous

But þis scorpioun þis wekede gost

The soudan comyth hym self sone aftyr this
So royali þat wondir is to telle

The tyme cam this olde soudonesse  
Ordeynyd hath this feste of which I telle
And to þe feste cristene folk hym dresse
In general ȝe bothe ȝynge and olde
Here may men feste and rialte beholde
And deynteis mo þan I can ȝow deuyse
But al to dere they bouȝte it er they ryse
O sodeyn wo that euere art successour
To wordely blysse spreynt with bittyrnesse
Thende of the ioye of oure wordely labour
Who occupiet the fyn of oure gladnesse
Herkene þis conseyl for thyn sekyrnesse

The onwar wo or harm that comyth behynde

But it were only dame custaunce alone
This olde soudanesse cursede crone

Ne þere was surreyn non that was conuertid
That of the conseyl of the soudon wot

And custaunce han they take anon fot hot
And in a schip al stereles god wot
They han hire set and bidde hire lerne sayle
Out of surrie ageyn ward to ytayle


A serteyn trosor that sche theþer ladde
And soth to sayn vitayle gret plente

And forth sche saylyth in the salte see
O myn custaunce ful of benyngnete

Sche blysseth hire and with ful pitous voys  
On to the Croys of crist thus seyde sche

On which thyn lyfis feythfully extenden

Ȝeerys and dayis fleth this creature
Torwout the strem of grece into strayte
Of marrok whiche that was hese auenture
On manye a sory Mel now may ȝe beyte
Aftyr hire deth ful ofte may sche wayte
Er than þe wylde wawys wole here dryue
Vnto the place there sche schal aryue
Men myȝtyn axsyn whi sche was not slayn
Ek at the feste ho myȝte hire body saue
And I answere to that demaunde agayn

In hire for we schud sen hise myȝty werkys

Now sythe sche was not at the feste slawee  
Who kepte hyre from the drenchynge in þe see
Who kepte Ionas in the fyschis mawee
Thil he was spoutid out at niniuee
Wel may men knowe it was no wiȝt but he
That kepte þe peple Ebrayk from here drenchynge
With dreye feet thorwout þe se passynge

That power han tanoyen lond and se
Bothe north and south and also west and est

As wel whan sche wok as whan sche slepte
Where myȝte this woman mete or drynk haue

Ho fedde þe egipcien marye in þe caue
Or in desert no wiȝt but crist sauns fayle

With louys fyue and fyschis too to feede

Vndyr an hold þat nemenyn I ne can

And in þe se hire schip stekede so faste

The wyl of here was þat sche schulde abyde
The constabele of þe Castel doun is fare
To sen þis wrak and al þe schip he souȝte
And fond þis wery woman ful of care
He fond also þe tresore þat sche brouȝte
In hyre langage mercy sche besouȝte

A maner latyn corupt was hire speche  
But algatis þerbi was sche vndirstonde

This woful woman brouȝte he to the londe
Sche knelyth doun and thankyth godis sonde
But what sche was sche durste no man seye

Sche seyde sche was so masede in the see
That sche forgat hire mynde by hyre trouthe
The cunstabele hath of hire gret pite
And ek his wif that þey wepe for routhe
Sche was so diligent withoutyn slouthe
To serue and plese eueryche in þat place
That alle hyre louyn þat lokyn in hyre face
This constabil and dame hermengylt his wyf
Were payenys in þat cuntrey euery where
But Ermengylt louede hire ryȝt as hire lyf
And Custaunce hath so longe soiurnede þere


In orisounys with manye a bittere tere
Til Ihesu hath conuertede þour hese grace
Dame Ermengilt Constabellesse of þat place
In al þat lond no cristene durste at route
Alle cristen folk ben fled from þat cuntre
Thour poynyms þat conqueredyn al aboute
The plagis of the north and se
To walis fledde þe cristianyte
Of olde brytunys dwellynge in þis yle
There was hire refeut for the mene while
But ȝit nere cristene britounys so exiled

Honourede crist and hethene folk begilede
And ngh þe castel swich þere dweltyn thre
That on of hem was blynd and myȝte not se
But it were with þe ilke eyen of hise mynde
Wit whiche men sen aftyr þat þey ben blynde
Bryȝt was þe sune as in þat someris day  
ffor which þe Constabel and hese wyf also
And custaunce hath Itake þe ryȝte way
Toward þe se a furlong wey or to
To pleyen and to romyn too and fro
And in hire walk þis blynde man þey mette
Crokid and old with eyen faste Ischette
In name of cryst cryede þis blynde Erytoun
Dame Hermengelt ȝif me myn syȝt ageyn
This lady wex afreyed of þe soun
Lest þat hire husbonde schortly for  seyn
Wolde hire for ihesu crist han slayn
Til Custaunce made hire bold and bad hire for to werche
The wil of crist as doughtyr of hise cherche


The Constabele wex abaschid of that syȝt
And seyde what amountyh al þis fare
Custaunce answere syre it is cristis myȝt
That helpith folk out of þe fendis snare
And so fer forth sche gan oure lay declare
That sche þe Constabele er þan it was eue
Conuertid and on cryst made hym bileue
This Constabele was no þyng lord of þis place
Of whiche I speke þere he constaunce fond
But kepte it strongely manye a wynteris space
Vndir alla kyng of al northhumbir londe
That was ful wys and worthi of hese honde
Ageyn þe skottis as men may wel here
But turne I wele agen to myn matyere
Satan þat euere wayth vs to begyle
Saugh of Custaunce al þe perfeccioun
And caste anon how he myȝte quite hire while
And made a ȝong knght þat dwellede in þat toun
Loue hire so hote of foul affeccioun
That verayly hym thouȝte he schulde spille
But he of hire myȝte onys haue hese wille
He wowyth hire but it auaylyth nouȝt  
Sche wolde don no synne be no weye
And for dispit he compassith in his thouȝt
To makyn hyre on schamful deth to deye
He waythith whan þe Constable is aweye
And priui vpon a nyȝt he crepte
Into Hermengildis chaumbere whil sche slepte
Wery forwakede in hire orysouns
Slepith custaunce and hemegild also
This knyȝt þour satanys temptacions
Al softeli is to þe bed Igo


And kitte þe throte of Hermegild a too
And leyde þe blodi knyf be dame Custaunce
And wente his wey þere god ȝyf hym myschaunce
Sone aftyr comyth this Constabele hom ageyn
And ek Alla þat kyng was of þat lond 
And saw his wif dispitously Islayn
ffor which ful ofte he wepte and wrong here hon
And in þe bed þe blody knyf he fond
By dame Constance Allas what myȝte sche seye
ffor werray woo hire wit was al aweye
To kyng alla was told þis tale Mischaunce
And ek þe tyme where and in what wyse
That in a schyp was founde þis custaunce
As here beforn þat ȝe han herd deuyse
The kyngis herte of pete gan to gryse
Whan he saw so benygne a creature
ffalle in desese and in mysauenture
ffor as þe lomb toward þe deth is brouȝt
So stant this innocent byfore þe kynge
This false knyȝt that hath this tresoun wrought
Beryth hire on honde þat sche hath don þis thynge
But natheles þere was gret mornyng
Among the puple and seyn þey can not gesse
That sche hadde don so gret a wekedenesse
ffor they han seyn hire so vertuous  
And louynge hermengild ryȝt as hire lyf
Of þis bar witnesse eueryche in that hous
Saue he þat hermengelt slow with his knyf
This gentil kyng hath cauȝt a gret motyf
Of this witnesse and thoght he wolde enquire
Deppere in this trouthe for to lere


Allas Custaunce þou hast no chaumpioun
Ne fyȝte canst þou so weyleawey
But he that starf for oure redempcioun
And bond satan and ȝit lyth þere he lay
So be þeyn stronge champioun þis day

Withoutyn gilt þou schat ben slayn aswythe
Sche sette hire doun on kneis and thus sche seyde

Han ȝe nat seyn sumtyme a pale face
Among a pres of hym þat hath be lad
Toward hese deth where as he gat no grace
And swich a colour in hese face hath had
Men myȝte knowe hise face þat was bestad
Amongis alle þe facis in þat route
So stant custaunce and lokyth hire a boute
O queenys lyuynge in prosperite
Duchesses and ȝe ladijs euerychone
Hauyth sum routhe of hire aduercite
An emperouris douȝtyr stant alone
Sche hath no wyȝt to whom to make hire mone
O blood royal þat standyst in þis drede
ffer ben thyne frendis at thi grete nede
This alla kyng hath swich compascioun  
As gentyl herte is ful fyld of pite
That from hyse eyen ran the watyr doun
Now hastyfliche do feche a bok quod he


And ȝif this knȝt wele swere þat sche

Sche gilty was and in the mene whilis
An hand hym smot vpon the nekke bon
That doun he fyl atonys as a ston
And bothe hise eyen broste vp on hise face
In syȝte of euery body in þat place
A woys was herd in general audience
And seyde þou hast disclaunderede gilteles
The douȝtyr of holy cherche in high presence
Thus hast þou don and ȝit I holde myn pees
Of this mervayle agast was al þe pres
As masede folk they stodyn euerychone
ffor drede of wreche saue Custaunce allone
Gret was þe dred and ek þe repentaunce
Of hem þat han wrong suspecioun
Vpon þis sely Innocent custaunce
And for this myrakele in conclusioun
And by Custauncis mediacioun
The kyng and manye a noþer in þat place
Conuertede were thankid be godis grace
This false knyȝt was slayn for hise ontrouthe
Be Iugement of alla hastifly
And ȝit Custaustaunce hadde of hise deth routhe
And aftyr this Ihesus of hise mercy
Made alla weddyn solempnely
This holy maydyn þat is so bryȝt and scheene
And þus hath Cryst mad Custaunce a queene


But who was woful ȝif I scal not lye  
Of this weddyng but donegild and no mo
The kyngis modir ful of tyrannye
Hire thouȝt hire curssede herte brast a to
Sche wolde not hire sone hadde don so
Hire thouȝte a dispit þat he schulde take
So straunge a creature vnto hise make
Me lyste not of þe chaf nor of þe stre
Makyn so long a tale as of þe corn
What sholde I telle of the royalte
At mariage or wich cours goth beforn
Who blowith in a trompe or in an horn
The freut of eueri tale is for to seye
They ete and drynke and daunce and synge and pleye
Thei gon to bedde as it was skele and ryȝt
ffor þow þat wiuys ben ful holye thyngis
They muste takyn in pacience at nyȝt
Swiche manere of necessarijs as ben plesyngis
To folk þat han wedit hem with ryngis
And leyn a lityl here holynesse asyde
As for þe tyme it may non oþer betyde
On hire he gat a knave child anon
And to a bischop and his constabele ek
He tok hise wyf to kepe whan he is gon
To skotlondeward hise fomen for to seke
Now fayre custaunce þat is so vmble and meke
So longe is gon with childe til þat stille
Sche halt hire chaumbere abydynge cristis wille
The tyme is come a knaue child sche beere
Mauricyus at þe funtston þey hym calle
This Constabele doth forth a massanger
And wrot onto his kyng þat clepid was alle


How þat this blisful tydyng is byfalle
And oþere tydyngis spedful for to seye
He taath þe lettere and forth he goth hise weye
This massanger to don his auauntage  
Vnto þe kyngis modyr ridyth swythe
And saluyth hire ful fare in hyre langage
Madame quod he ȝe may ben glad and blyþe
And thankede god a hunderede thousent sythe
Myn lady quen hath child withoutyn doute
To Ioye and blysse to al þe regne aboute
Lo here þe letteris selede of þis thyng
That I mot bere with þe haste I may
Ȝif ȝe wele ouȝt onto ȝoure sone þe kyng
I am ȝoure seruaunt bothe nyȝt and day
Donegild answerede as now at þis tyme nay
But here al nyght I wele þou take þyn reste
To morwe wele I seye þe what me leste
This massangere drank faste ale and wyn
And stole were hise letteris priuyly
Out of his box whil he slepte as a swyn
And countyrfetid was ful subtilly
Anoþer lettere wrouȝt ful synfully
Vnto þe kyng direckt of this matere
ffrom his Constabil as ȝe schal aftyr here
The lettere spak þe quen delyuerede was
Of so orible and fendlyche cryature
That in þe castel non so hardy was
That ony while durste þere endure
The modyr was an elf be nature
Icomyn by charmys or bi socerye
And euery wyȝt hath hire cumpanye


Wo was this kyng whan he þis lettere hath seyn
But to no wyȝt he tolde hise sorwis sore
But of hyse owene hand he wrot ageyn
Wolcome þe sonde of cryst for euere more
To me that am now lernede in þis lore
Lord wolcome be thyn lust and þyn plesaunce
Myn lust I putte al in thyn ordenaunce
Kepith this child al be it foul or fayr  
And ek myn wyf onto myn hom comynge

More agriable þan this to myn lykynge
This lettere he selyth pryuyly wepynge
Whiche to þe massangere was take sone
And forth he goth þere is no more to done
O Massanger fulfild of dronkenesse
Strong is thi breth thi lemys falteryn ay
And þou bewreyest alle sekerenesse
Thyn mynde is lorn þou iangelist as a Iay
Thyn face is turnede in a newe aray
There dronkenesse regnyth in ony route
There is no conseyl hid withoutyn doute
O donegilt I haue non engelissh dygne

And þerfore to þe fend I þe resigne
Let hym endyte of thyn tratorye

Thow þow here walke thyn spyrit is in helle
This Massanger comyth from þe kyng ageyn
And at þe kyngis moderis court he lyghte
And sche was of þe massenger ful fayn
And plesede hym in al þat euere sche myȝte

He slepith and he snortith in hise gyse
Al nyȝt tyl þe sunne gan aryse
Eft were hise letterys stolyn euerychon
And counterfetid letterys in þis wyse
The kyng comaundyth hise constablis anon
Vp peyne of hangynge and heigh Iuyse
That he ne schulde suffere in no wyse

Thre dayis and a quartyr of a tide
But in þe same schip as he hire fond  
Hire and hyr ȝenge sone and al hire geere
He schulde putte and croude from þe lond
And charge hire þat sche neuere eft come þere
O myn custaunce wel may þy gost haue fere
And slepynge in þyn drem han penaunce
Whan donegilt caste al þis ordenaunce
This messenger on morwe he wok
Onto þe castel holt þe neste wey
And to þe constabele he þe lettere tok
And whan þat he þis pitous lettere say
fful ofte he seyde allas and weyleaway
Lord crist how may þis world endure
So ful of synne is manye a cryature
O myȝti god ȝif þat it be þyn wille
Sith þou art ryȝtful Iuge how may þis be
That þou wit suffere innocentis to spille
And wekede folk regnyn in prosperite
O goode Custaunce allas so wo is me

On schamys deth þere is non oþer weye


Wepyn bothe ȝynge and olde in þat place
Whan þat þe kyng his cursede letere sente
And Custaunce with a dedly pale face
The forte day toward hire schip sche wente
But natheles sche takyth in good entente
The wil of crist and knelynge on þe stronde
Sche seyde lord ay wolcome be þyn sonde

Whil I was on þe lond amongis ȝow
He can me kepe from harm and ek from schame
In þe salte se al þow I se nat how

And knelynge pitously to hym sche seyde

With þat hire couerchif ouer hire hed sche bryde
And ouer hise lityl eyen sche it leyd
And in hyre arm sche lullede it ful faste
And into heuene hyre eyen vp sche caste

Man kynde was lorn and dampnede for to deye

Thanne is þere non comparisoun betwene

Thow saw þyn child slawyn before þyn eyen
And ȝit now lyuyth my lityl child parfey
Now lady bryȝt to whom alle folk now cryen
Thow glorye of womanhede fayre may


Thow hauene of refut bryȝte sterre of day
Rewe on myn child þat of þyn gentillesse
Rewist on euery reuful in destresse
O lityl child allas what is þyn gilt
That neuere wroughtist synne as ȝit parde
Whi wolde thyn harde fadyr han þe spilt
O mercy dere constabele quod sche
As lat myn lytil child dwelle here with þe
And ȝif þou darst not sauyn hym from blame
So kysse hym onys in hese faderys name
Therwith sche lokith bakward to þe londe
And seyde farewe housbonde routheles
And vp sche rist and walkyth doun þe stronde
Toward þe schip here folwyth al þe pres
And euere sche preyeth hire child to holde hise pes
And takyth hire leue and with an holy entente
Sche blysseth hire and into schip sche wente
Vitaylid was þe schip it is no drede  
Habundaunt for hyre ful longe space
And oþere necessaryis þat schuldyn nede

And brynge hire hom I can no betere seye
But in þe se sche dryuyth forth hire weye
Alla þe kyng comyth hom soone aftyr þis
Onto þe Castel whiche I tolde
And axsith where þat his wif and his child is
The Constabele gan aboute hise herte colde


And pleynly al þe manere hym tolde
As ȝe han herd I can telle it no bettre
As schewith þe kyng his sel and hise lettere
And seyde lord as ȝe comaundede me
Vp peyne of deth so haue I do serteyn
This massanger turmentid was tyl he
Moste beknowe and telle plat and pleyn
ffrom nyȝt to nyȝt what place he hadde leyn
And þus by wit and subtyl Inquyrynge
Ymagined was bi hom þis harm gan sprynge
The hand was knowe þat þe lettere wrot
And al þe venym of þis cursede dede
But in what wise serteynli I not
Theffect is þis þat Alla out of drede
His modyr slow þat may men pleynly rede
ffor þat sche traytour was to hire legiaunce
Thus endyth donegild with myschaunce
The sorwe þat þis alla nyȝt and day
Makith for his wif and hise child also
Ther is no tunge þat it telle may
But now wolde I onto Custaunce go
That fletyth in þe se in peyne and wo
ffyue ȝer and more as lykede cristis sonde
Er þat hir schip aprochede to þe londe
Vndyr an hethene castel at þe laste  
Of which þe name in myn tixt not I fynde
Custaunce and ek hire child þe se vp caste
Almyȝty god þat sawith al mankynde
Haue on custaunce and of hire child sum mynde
that is fallyn in hethene hand eft sone
In poynt to spylle as I schal telle ȝow sone


Doun from þe castel comyth þere manye a wyȝt
To gauryn on þis wyȝt and on custaunce
But schortly from þe castel on a nyȝt
The lordis styward god ȝeue hym myschaunce
A thef that hadde reneyed oure creaunce
Cam into þe schip alone and seyde he schulde
Hire leman be wheþer sche wolde or nolde
Wo was þe wrechede woman þo begon
Hire child cryed and sche cryede pitously
Blysful marye halp hyre ryȝt anon
ffor with hire strogelyng wel and myȝtyly
The thef fel ouyr bord al sodeynly
And in þe se he dreynte for veniaunce
And þus hath cryst onwemmede kept custaunce
O foule lust of luxurye lo thyn ende
Not only þat þou feyntist manys mynde
But verayly þou wilt hise body schende
Thende of þy werk or of þynne lustis blynde
Is compleynynge how manyon may men fynde
That not for werk but only þe entente
To don þis synne ben owthir slayn or schente
How may þis wayke woman han þis strenthe
Hire to defende aȝen þis Renegat
O golyas vnmesurabe of lenthe
How myȝte dauid make þe so maat
So ȝong and of armeure so desolat
How durste he loke vpon þyn dredful face
Wel may men sen it was but godis grace
Ho ȝaf Iudyth corage or hardynesse  
To slen hym Olofernus in hise tente
And to delyueryn out of wrechedenesse
The peple of god I sey for þis entente


But ryȝt as god spyrit of vigour sente
To hym and sauede hym from myschaunce
So sente vigour and myȝt to Custaunce
fforth goth the schip þourout þe narwe mouth
Of Iubaltare  and Cepte dryuynge ay
Sumtyme west and sumtyme north and south
And sumtyme est ful many a wery day
Til Cristis modyr blyssede be sche ay
Hath schapyn þour hire endeles goodnesse
To make an ende of al hire heuynesse
Now lat vs stynte of Custaunce but a trowe
And speke we of þe romayn Emperour
That out of surry hath bi letterys knowe
The slauthe of Cristene folk and dishonoure
Don to his douȝtyr by a fals traytoure
I mene þe wikkede cursede soudonesse
That at þe feste let sle boþe more and lesse
ffor which þis emperour hath sent anor
His senatour with royal ordenaunce
And oþere lordis god wot many on
On surryens to take veniaunce
They brenne and slen and brynge hem to myschaunce
fful manyaday but schortly þis is þe ende
Homward to rome þey schapyn hem to wende
This senatour repayreth wictorye
To romeward saylynge ful ryalye
And mette þe schyp dryuynge as seyth þe story
In which Custaunce sit pitously
No þyng knewe he what sche was ne why
Sche was in swich aray  ne sche wolde seye
Of hyre estat þow sche schulde deye


He bryngith hire to rome and to hise wyf  
He ȝaf hire and hire ȝonge sone also
And with þe senatour sche ledde hire lyf
Thus can oure lady bryngyn out of wo
Woful custaunce and manye a noþer mo
And long tyme dwellede sche in þat plase
In holye werkys euere as was hyre grace
This senatourys wyf hyre aunte was
But for al þat sche knew hyre neuere þe more
I wele no lengere taryen in þis cas
But to kyng alla which I spak of ȝore
That for hise wyf wepede and syghede sore
I wele retorne and lete I wele Custaunce
Vndyr þe senatourrys gouernaunce
Kyng Alla wich þat hadde hise modyr slayn
Vpon a day fil In swich repentaunce
That ȝif I schortely schulde telle and playn
To rome he comyth to receyue hese penaunce
And putte hym in þe popis ordenaunce
In high and logh and Ihesu crist besouȝte
fforȝeue hise wikke werkis þat he wrouȝte
The fame anon þour rome toun is born
How Alla kyng schal come in pilgrymage
By herberiourys þat wentyn here beforn
ffor which þe senatour as was þe vsage
Rod hym ageyn as was þe vsage
As wel to schewyn his magnificence
As to don any kyng a reuerence
Gret cher doth þis noble senatour  
To kyng alla and he to hym also
Euerych of hem doþ oþer gret honour
An that within a day or too


This senatour is to kyng Alla go
To feste and schortly ȝif I schal not lye
Custauncis sone wente in his cumpanye
Summen wolde seyn at þe request of Custaunce
This senatour hath lad þis child to feste
I ne may not tellyn euery circumstaunce
Be as be may þere was he at þe leste
But soth is þis þat at his moderys heste
Byforn Alla durynge þe metis space
This child stod lokynge in þe kyngis face
This Alla kyng hath of þe child gret wondyr
And to þe senatour he seyde anon
Whos is þat fayre child þat standis ȝondyr
I not quod he bi god and bi seynt Iohn
A modyr he hath but fadyr hath he non
That I of wot and schortly in a stounde
He tolde alla how þat þe child was founde
But god wot quod this senatour also
So verteuous a leuere in myn lyue
Ne saw I neuere as sche ne herde of mo
Of wordely wemen maydyn nor of wif
I dare wel seyn hire hadde leuere a knyf
Thurghout hyre brest þan ben a woman weke
þere is no man coude brynge hire to þe prikke
Now was þis child as lyk onto custaunce
As possible is a creatour to be
This alla hath þis face in remembraunce
Of dame custaunce and þeron musede he
Ȝif þat þe childis modyr were ouȝt sche
That is his wyf and pryuyly he sighte
And sped hym from þe table þat he myȝte


Parfay thouȝte he fantome is in myn hed  
I oghte deme of ryȝtful iugement
That in þe salte se myn wif is ded
And aftyr he made hise argument
What wot I if þat crist hath hire Isent
Myn wif be se as wel as he hire sente
To myn cuntre from þens þat sche wente
And aftyr non hom with þe senatour
Goth alla for to se þis wondyr chaunce
This senatour doth alla gret honour
And hastilyche he sente aftyr custaunce
But trustyth wel hire lyste not to daunce
Whan þat sche wiste wherfore was þat sonde
Oneþe vpon hire feet sche myȝte stonde
Whan Alla saw his wif fayre he hire grette
And wep þat it was routhe for to se
ffor at þe ferste lok he on hyre sette
He knewe wel verayly þat it was sche
And sche for sorwe as doumb stant as a tre
So was hire herte set in distresse
Whan sche remembrede hys vnkyndenesse
Twyes sche swounnyth in hise owene syghit
He wepte and hym excuseth pitously
Now god quod he and hise halwis bryȝte
So wisely on myn soule as haue mercy
That of ȝoure harm as gilteles am I
As is Mauryce myn sone so lyk ȝoure face
Ellis þe fend me feche out of þis place
Long was þe sobyng and þe bittere peyne
Er þat hire woful hertis myȝtyn cesse
Gret was þe pyte for to here hem pleyne
Thorgh whiche pleyntis gan hire wo encrese


I prey ȝow of myn labour to relese
I may nat telle here wo vntyl to morwe
I am so wery for to speke of sorwe
But finalli whan þat þe sorwe is wist  
That Alla giltles was of hire wo
I trowe an hunderede tymys ben þey kyst
And swich a blysse is þere betwen hem two
That saue þe ioye þat lastyth eueremo
There is non lyk þat any creature
Hath seyn or schal whil þe word wele dure
Tho preyede sche hire housbonde mekely
In relef of hire longe pitous peyne
That he wolde preye hire fadyr specially
That of his maieste he wolde enclyne
To vouchesaf sumday with hem to dyne
Sche preyede hym ek he schulde be no weye
Vnto hire fadyr no word of hire seye
Summen wolde seyn how þat þe child mauryce
Doth þis message vnto þis emperour
But as I gesse alla was not so nyce
To hym þat was of so souereyn honour
As he þat is of cristene folk þe flour
Sente any child but it is bet to deme
He wente him selue and so it may wel seme
This emperour hath grauntid gentyly
To come to dyner as he hym besouȝte
And wel rede I he lokede besily
Vpon þis child and on his douȝtyr thouȝte
Alla goth to hise in and as hym ouȝte
Arayede for þis feste in euery wyse
As fer forth as hise kunnynge may suffyse


The morwe cam and alla gan hym dresse
And ek his wif þis emperour to mete
And forth þey rede In ioye and in gladnesse
And whan sche saw hire fadyr in þe strete
Sche lyȝte adoun and fallyth hym to feete
ffadyr quod sche ȝoure ȝonge chyld Custaunce
Is now ful clene out of ȝoure remembraunce
I am ȝoure douȝty custaunce quod sche  
That whilhom han sent vnto surrye
It am I fadyr þat in þe salte se
Was put alone and dampned for to deye
Now goode fadyr mercy I ȝow preye
Sende me no more vnto to non hethenesse
But thanke myn lord here of his kyndenesse
Who can þe pytous ioye tellyn al
Bytwexe hem thre syn þey ben þus Imette
But of myn tale makyn an ende I schal
The day goth faste I wele no lengere lette
These glade folk to dyner þey ben sette
In ioye and blysse at dyner I lete hem dwelle
A thousent fold more þan I can telle
This child Maurice was sythe emperour
Mad bi þe pope and lyuede cristene lyf
To Cristis cherche he dede gret honour
But I lete alle hise storyis passyn by
Of Custaunce is myn tale specially
In þe olde romayn storyis may men fynde
Maurycis lyf I bere it not in mynde
This kyng Alla whan he hise tyme say
With his Custaunce his holy wif so swete
To ingelond ben þey come þe ryȝte way
Where as þey lyue In ioye and in quiete


But lytil while it lastyth I ȝow hete
Ioye of þis world for tyme wele not abyde
ffrom day to nyȝt it schaungith as þe tyde
Who lyuede euere in swich delyt a day
That sche ne menede outhir concyence
Or yre or talent or sumkenys afray
Enuye or pride or passioun or offence
I ne seye but for þis ende this sentence
That lytyl while in ioye and in plesaunce
Lastith þe ioye of alla with Custaunce
ffor deth þat takyth of high and low hise rente  
Whan passede was euene a ȝer as I gesse
Out of þe world þis kyng alla he hente
ffor whom Custaunce hath ful gret heuinesse
Now let vs preyen god his soule blysse
And dame Custaunce finally to seye
Toward þe toun goth hire weye
To rome is comyn þis holy creature
And fyndith hire frendis hole and sounde
Now is sche scapid al hire Auenture
And whan þat sche hire fadyr hath Ifounde
Doun on hire kneis fallyth sche to grounde
Wepynge for tendirnesse in herte blyþe
Sche heryeth god an hundered thousent sythe
In vertu and holy allemesse dede
They lyuyn alle and neuere asundyr wende
Thil deth departyth hem þis lyf þey leede
And faryth now wel myn tale is at an ende
Now Ihesu crist þat of his myȝt may sende
Ioye aftyr wo gouerne vs in hise grace
And kepe vs alle þat ben in þis place Amen
Experyment þough none auctoryte
Were in þis worlde is riȝt ynouȝe for me
To speke of woo þat ys in mariage
ffor lordynges siþen I twelfe yere was of age
Thanked by god þat ys eterne on lyue
Housbondes atte Chirche dore haue I hade fyue
Yf I so ofte myȝt haue wedded be
But alle were worþi men in her degre
But me was tolde certayne not longe agone ys
þat sithen cryste ne went nevere but onys
To weddynge in þe Cane of Galile
þat be þilke ensample tauȝt he me
þat I ne shulde wedded be but onys
Herke with a sharpe worde with þe nonys
By syde a welle Ihesu god and man
Spake in reprefe of þe Samarytan
Thou haste yhade v husbondes quod he
And þat ilke man þat nowe hathe the
Ys not þine husbonde þus sayde he certayne
What he mente þerby I can not sayne
Well but I axe why þe fyfte man
Was none housbonde to þe Samarytan
And herde telle in myne age
howe many myȝt she haue in mariage
  
Vpon þis nombre of diffinicion
Men may deuyne and glose vp and doun
But wele I wote expresse without lye
God bad vs wexe and multiplie
þat gentille text can I wele vndirstonde
Eke wele I wote he sayd myn husbonde
Schulde let ffadir and modir and take to me
But of none nombre mencion made he
Of Bygamye or of Octogamye
Whi shulde men of hit haue vilonye
Loke better þe wyse man kynge Salamon
I trowe he hade wyues mo þan on
Now wold god hit leffulle were to me  
To be refresshid half so ofte as he
Whiche yifte of god hade he for alle his wyues
No man þat hathe suche þat in þis world ys
God wote þis noble kynge as to my witte
The fyrst nyȝt hade many a mery fytte
With Iche of hem so wele was he a lyue
Blissed be god þat I haue weddid fyue
Welle come þe sixte whan þat euere he shalle
ffor siche I wille nouȝt kepe chaste in alle
What myne husbonde ys fro þe worlde gone
Some crysten man shalle wedde me anone
ffor þan þe Appostell seithe þat I am fre
To wedde a goddes half where hit likes me
he seyth þat to be weddid ys no synne
Bettere ys to be wedded þan to brenne
What recketh me þouȝe folke say vilonye
Of shrewed lameche and his Bygamye
I wote wele Abraham was an holy man
And Iacob eke as fer as I euere can
And eche of  hade wyues mo þan two
And many an othere man also
Where can ye say in eny manere age
þat vs god deffendid mariage
  
By expresse worde I prey you telle me
Or where comaundid he virgynyte
I wote as wele as ȝe hit ys no drede
The Apostill whan þat he speketh of Maydenhede
he sayd precept þerof hade he none
Men May consayle a woman to ben one
But consaylynge ys none comaundement
He putte hit in oure owen Iugement
ffor hade god commaunded Maydenhede
þan hade he dampned weddynge with þe dede
And certes yf þere were no sede ysowe
Virgynyte þan whereof shuld hit growe
Poule durste not comaunden atte leste  
A thynge of whiche his Mayster yaf hym none heste
þe dart ys set vpe for Virgynite
Chase who so may who so renneth best let see
But þis word is not take of euery wyght  
But þere as god lust ȝeue it of hise myȝt
I wot wel þat thapostele was a mayde
But natheles thogh þat he wrot and sayde
He wolde þat euery were swych as he
Al nys but cunseyl to virginite
And for to been a wyf he ȝaf me leue
Of indulgence so is it no repreue
To wedde me ȝif myn make deye
Withoute excepcioun of bygamye
Al were it good no woman for to touche
He mente as in his bed as in hyse couche
ffor peril is fer and tow thasemble
ȝe knowe what þis exsaumple may recemble
This is al and sum þat virginyte
More profitith þan weddyng in frelete
ffrelete clepe I ȝif̣ þat he and sche
Wolde leede al here lyf in chastite
I graunte it wel I haue non enuye
Thow maydynhed profere bigamye
  
Hem lykith to be clene body and gost
Of myn estat I nyl not make no bost
ffor wel ȝe wete a lord in hyse houshold
He hath nat euery vessel al of gold
Some ben of tre and don here lord seruyse
God clepith folk to hym in sundery wyse
And eueryche hath of god a propere ȝifte
Summe þis some þat as hym lestyth schyfte
Virginite 1is gret perfeccyoun1
And contynens ek with reson
But crist þat of perfeccioun is welle
Bad nat euery wyȝt schulde selle
Al þat he hadde and ȝeue it to þe pore
And in swich wise folwe hym and hese foore
He spak to hem þat wolde leue perfytly
And lordyngys by ȝoure leue þat am nat I
I wele bestowe þe flour of al myn age
In the artys and in þe freut of maryage
Telle me also to what conclusyoun  
Were membris made of generacioun
And for what profyt was a wyf Iwrouȝt
Trostyth ryȝt wel þey were nat mad for nouȝt
Glose ho so wele I seye vp and doun
That þey were makyd for purgacyoun
Of vryne boþe and thyngis smale
And ek to knowe a femel from a male
And for non oþer cause sey ȝe no
The experience wit wel it is nat so
So þat ȝe clerkis ben nat with me wrothe
I seye þis þat þey ben makede for boþe
That is to seye for offyse and for ese
Of engendereure þere we not god displese
Whi schuldyn men ellys in here bokis sette
That a man schal ȝilde to his wif hire dette
Now wherewith schulde he make hyse payement
If he ne vsede his instrument
  
Thanne were þey made vpon a creature
To purge vryne and for engendereure
But I sey not þat euery wyȝt is holde
That hath swich harneys as I of tolde
To gon and vse hem in engenderure
They schul nat take of chastite no cure
Cryst was a maydyn and schapyn as a man
And manye a seynt sithe þe world began
ȝit leuede þey euere in parfyt chastite
I nyl not enuye swych virginite
Let hem be bred of pure whete seed
And lat vs wyuys hote barli breed
And ȝit with barli bred mark telle can
That oure lord refroschid manye a man
In swich estat as god clepith vs
I wele perseuere I am nat precious
In wyfhod I wele vse myn instrument
As frely as myn makere hath it sent
ȝif I be dangerous god gif me sorwe
Myn housbonde schal it haue on eue and morwe
Whan þat hym lyste come forth and paye hise dette  
An housbonde wele I haue I nyl nat lette
Whiche schal be boþe myn detour and myn thral
And haue hise trybulacioun withal
Vpon hise flesch whil I am his wyf
I haue þe power durynge al myn lyf
Vpon hyse proper body and noght he
Ryght þus thapostele tolde it me
And bad oure housbondys forto loue vs wel
Al þis sentence me likyth euerydel
Vp sterte þe pardoūner and þat anon
Now dame quod he bi god and by seyn Iohn

I was abute to wedde a wyf allas
What schulde I it beye on myn flesch so dere
ȝit hadde I leuere wedde no wif to ȝere
  
Abyde quod sche myn tale is nat begunne
Nay þou schat drynkyn of anoþer tunne
Or þan I go schal sauoure werse þan ale
And whan þat I haue told forth myn tale
Of trybulacioun þat is in maryage
Of which I am expert in al myn age
This is to seyn myn self hath ben þe wippe
Thanne mayȝt þou chese wheþer þou wolt skyppe
Of þat tunne þat I schal abroche
Be war of it er þou to nygh aproche

Who so þat wele nat be war by oþere men

Dame I wolde preye ȝif ȝoue wil it were

Tellyth forth ȝoure tale sparyth nan
And tellith vs ȝynge men of ȝoure praptik
Gladly sire sithe it may ȝow lyk
But ȝit I preye to al þis cumpaynye
If þat I speke aftyr myn fantasye
As takyth nat a gres þat I seye  
ffor myn entent is but for to pleye
Now sere now wele I telle forth myn tale
As euere mote I drynkyn wyn or ale
I schal sey soth of housbondis þat I hadde
As thre of hem were goode and thre were badde
The thre men were goode and rych and olde
Oneþe myȝt þey þe statut holde
In which þat þey were boundyn on to me
ȝe wete wel what I mene of þis parde
As helpe me god I laughe whan I thynke
How pytously on nyȝt I made hem to swynke
But be myn fey I tolde of it no stor
They haddyn me ȝeuyn hire lond and hire tresor
  
Me nedede not do lengere diligence
To wynne hire loue and don hire reuerence
They louede me so wel by god aboue
That I ne told no deynte of here loue
As wys woman wele sette hire euere in on
To gete hire loue þere as sche hath non
But sythe I haue hem holy in myn hond
And sithe þey han me ȝeuyn al here lond
What schulde I take hed hem for to plese
But ȝif it were for myn profyt and myn ese
I sette hem so awerke be myn fey
That manye a nyȝt þey sunge weyleawey
The bakon was nat fet for hem I trowe
That some men han in exces at dunmowe
I gouernede hem so wel aftyr my lawe
That eche of hem was blysful and ful fawe
To brynge me gay þyng from þe feyre
They were ful glad whan I spak tyl hem fayre
ffor god it wot I schid hem spitously
Now herkenyth how I bar me properly
ȝe wise wyuys þat kunne vndyrstonde
Thus schul ȝe speke and bere hem wrong on honde
ffor half so boldely can þere no man
Swere and lye as can a woman

But ȝif it be whan þey hym mysavise
A wis wif ȝif þat sche can hire good
Schal bere hym on hande þe cou is wod
And take witnesse of hire owene mayde
Of hire asent but herkenyth how I seyde

What rounne ȝe with oure maydenys benedicite

And ȝif I haue a gossib or a frend
Withoutyn gilt þou chidist as a fend
ȝif þat I walke or pleye vntyl hise hous

And prechist on þyn bench with euele pref

To wedde a poore woman for costage
And ȝif sche be ryche and of hey parage

To suffere hire pryde and malencolye
And ȝif þat sche be fayr þou veray knaue

And some for sche can synge and daunce
And some for gentilesse and some for dalyaunce
Some for hire handis and for hire armys smale
Thus goth al to þe deuyl be þyn tale
Thow seyst men may nat kepe a castel wal

And ȝif þat sche be foul þou seyst þat sche
Coueytith euery man þat sche may se

Til þat sche fynde sum man hire to schepe
Ne non so grey gos þat goth in þe lake

And seyst it is an hard þyng for to welde
A thyng þat no man wele hise thankis helde
Thow seyst horel whan þou gost to bedde
How þat no wys man nedyth for to wedde
Ne no man þat tendyth onto heuene
With wylde thundyr dynt in fery leuene
  
Mote þyn wekede neke be tobroke

But ȝif þat þou wilt preyse myn beute

To barayne lond þere no watyr may dwelle

Ryȝt so a wif distroyeþ hire husbonde
That knowyn þey þat ben to wyuys bonde

And al was fals but þat I tok witnes

They were ful glad to excuse hem blyue
Of thyng þey neuere agilt in al here lyue
And of wenchis wolde I bere hem on honde
Whan þat for sek oneþe myȝte stonde

Wende þat I hadde had of hym gret chirte

And þus of on thyng I awaunte me
At þe ende I hadde þe betere in eche degre
Be sleyghe or forse or sum manere thynge
As by continuel murmure and grochynge
Nameli on bedde hadde þey myschaunce
There wolde I chide and don hem non plesaunce
I wolde no lengere in þe bed abyde
ȝif þat I felte his arm ouyr myn syde
Til he hadde mad his raunsum on to me
Thanne wolde I suffere hym to don hise nysete
And þerfore euery man hise tale telle
Wyn ho so may for al is for to selle
With emty hond men may none haukys lure
ffor wynnyng wolde I al hise lust endure
And make me a feynede apetit
And ȝit in bacoun hadde I neuere delit
þat made me euere þat I wolde hym chyde  
ffor þow þe pope hadde sete by hyse syde
  
I nolde hym spare at hise owene boord
ffor by myn trouthe I quitte hym word for word
As help me veray god omnypotent
Thow I schulde make now myn testement
I ne owe hem nat a word þat it nys quit
I brouȝte it so aboute by myn wit
That þey muste ȝeue it vp as for þe beste
Or ellis hade we neuere ben in reste
ffor þow he lokede as a wood lyoun
ȝit he schulde fayle of hise conclusioun
Thanne wolde I seye goode loue take kep
How mekely lokyth wilkyn oure schep
Come neer myn spouse lat me ba þyn scheke
ȝe schul be al pacient and meke
And haue a swete spicede concience
Sithin ȝe preche so of Iobes pacience
Sufferith alwey sithe ȝe so wel can preche
And but ȝe don certeyn we schul ȝow teche
That it is fayr to haue a wyf in pes
On of vs to muste bouwe douteles
And seyth a man is more resonable
þan woman is ȝe muste be sufferable
What eylyth ȝow thus to groche and grone
Is it for ȝe wolde han myn queynte alone
Whi take it al lo haue it euerydel
Petyr Ischrewe ȝow but ȝe loue it wel
ffor ȝif I wolde selle myn belechose
I coude walke as frosch as ony rose
But I wele kepe it for ȝoure owene toth
ȝe ben to blame by god I seye ȝow soth
Sweche manere of wordis hadde we on honde
Now wele I speke of myn fourte housbonde
Myn fourte housbonde was a reuelour
This is to seyne he hadde a paramour
And I was ȝong and ful of ragerye
Styborne and strong and Ioly as a pye
  
Wel coude I daunce to an harpe smale  
And synge Iwis as ony nyghtyngale
Whan I hadde dronke a drauȝt of swete wyn
Metullius þe foule clerk þe swyn
That with a staf berafte his wif hire lyf
ffor sche drank wyn and I hadde been his wif
He schulde nat a dauntid me from drynk
And aftyr wyn on venus muste I thynk
ffor al so sykyr as cold engenderyth hayl
A lycorous mouth muste han a licorous tayl
In woman vinolent is no defence
This knowyn lechourys bi experyence
But lord cryst whan it remembryth me
Vpon myn thout and on myn iolyte
It tykelith me aboute myn herte rote
Vnto þis day it doth myn herte bote
That I haue had myn world as In myn tyme
But age allas þat al wole vndyrmyne
Hath me bereft myn beute and myn pith
Let go farewel þe deuyl go þerwith
The flour is gon þere is no more to telle
The bren as I best can now muste I selle
But ȝit to ben merye wele I euere fonde
Now wele I telle of myn fourte husbonde
I seye I hadde in herte gret dispit
That he of ony oþer hadde delyt
But he was quit by god and be seynt Ioce
I made hym of þe same wode a croce
Nat of myn body in no foul maner
But serteynly I made folk swich cher
That in hise owene grese I made hym frye
ffor pure angir and for Ielouye
Bi god in erþe he was in purgatorie
ffor whiche I hope his soule be in glorie
ffor god it wot he sat ful ofte and song
Whan þat his schon ful bittyrly him wrong
  
There was no wyȝt but god and he þat wiste
In manye wise how sore I hym twyste
He deyede whan I cam from Ierusalem  
And lith Igraue vndir þe rode bem
Al Is his toumbe not so coryous
As was þe sepulcre of hym daryus
Whiche þat Arpelles wrouȝte so subtily
It is but wast to burye hem so precyously
Lat hym fare wel god ȝeue his soule reste
He is now in hise graue and in his cheste
Now of myn fifte husbonde wele I telle
God lete his soule neuere come in helle
And ȝit was he to me þe moste schrewe
That fele I on mynne rebis alle bewrewe
And euere schal vnto myn endyng day
But in oure bed he was so frosch and gay
And þerwithal wel coude he me glose
Whan þat he wolde haue myn belechose
That þow he hadde me betyn on euery bon
He coude wynne myn loue aȝen anon
I trowe I louede hym beste for þat he
Was of his loue dangerous to me
We wemen haue ȝif I schal nat lye
In þis matyre a queynte fantasye
That what þyng we may nat lyȝtely haue
þeraftyr wele most crye and craue
fforbede vs thyng þat desyre we
Presse on vs faste and þanne wele we fle
With daunger oute we oure chaffare
Gret pres in market makyth dere ware
And to good chep is holde of lytyl prys
This knowyth euery woman þat is wys
Myn fyfte husbonde god his soule blysse
Whiche þat I tok for loue and no rychesse
He sumtyme was a clerk of oxsene forde
And hadde left skole and wente at hom to borde
  
With myn gossib dwellynge in oure toun
God haue hire soule hire name was alysoun
Sche knew myn herte and ek myn pryuite
Bet þan oure paryche prest so mote I the
To hire bewreyede I myn conseyl al  
ffor hadde myn husebonde pissede on a wal
Or don ony thyng þat schulde a cost his lyf
To hire and to anoþer worthi wyf
And to myn nece þat I louede wel
I wolde haue tolde hise conseyl euerydel
And so I dede ful ofte god it wot
That made hise face ofte red and hot
ffor verray schame and blamede hym self þat he
Hadde told me so gret a pryuyte
And so befel þat onys in a lente
So ofte tyme I to myn gossib wente
ffor euere þat I louede to be gay
And for to walke in marsch auerylle and may
ffrom hous to hous to heryn sundery talis
That Iankyn clerk and myn gossib dame Alis
And I myn self vp to þe feldis wente
Myn housbonde was at lundene al þat lente
And I hadde þe betere leyser for to pleye
And for to se and ek for to be seye
Of lusty folk what wyste I where myn grace
Whas schape for to be or in what place
Therfore I made mynne visitaciounnys
To vigilis and to procesciounnys
To prechyngis ek and to pylgrymagis
To pleyes of myrakelis and of mariagis
And werede vpon myne scarlet gites
These wormes these mothis and these mytis
Vpon myn peryl frete hem neuere a del
And wost þou why for they were vsede wel
Nowe wele I telle forth what happede me
I seye þat in the feldys walkede we
  
Tyl trewely we haddyn swich a dalyaunce
This clerk and I þat of myn puruyaunce
I spak to hym and seyde how þat he
ȝif I were wedewe he schulde wedde me
ffor serteynly I seye for no bobaunce
ȝit was I neuere withoute puruyaunce
Of mariage and more thyngis eek  
I holde a mousys herte not worth a leek
That hath but on hole to sterte to
And that fayle thanne is al Ido
I bere hym on honde he enchauntede me
Myn dame taughte me þat sotylete
And ek I seyde I mette of hym al nyȝt
He wolde a slayn me as I lay vp ryȝt
And al myn bed was ful of veray blood
But ȝit I hope þat he schal do me good
ffor blood betokenyth gold as me was tauȝt
And al was fals I dremede of it ryght nauȝt
But I folwede ay myn damys lore
As wel of this as of oþere thyngis more
But now syre lat se what schal I seyn
Aha by god I haue myn tale ageyn
What that myn husbonde was on bere
I weep and made a sory chere
As wyuys motyn for it is vsage
And with myn couerechef couerede myn visage
But for þat I was purueyed of a make
I wepte but smal and þat I vndyrtake
To cherche was myn husbond o born on morwe
With negheboris þat for hym madyn sorwe
And Iankyn oure klerk was on of thoo
As help me god whan that I saw hym goo
Aftyr þe beere me thoughte he hadde a payre
Of leggis and feet so clene and fayre
That al myn herte I ȝaf vnto his hold
He was I trowe twenty wyntyr old
  
And I was fourty ȝif I schal sey sooth
And ȝit I hadde alway a coltys toth
Gattothid I was and that becam me wel
I hadde the prente of seynt peterys sel
As help me god I was a lusty on
ffayr and ryche and frosch and wel begon
And trewely as myn husbondys toldyn me
I hadde the beste quoniam that myȝte be
ffor sertis I am al venerient  
In felynge and myn herte is marcient
Venus me ȝaf myn lust myn licorousnesse
And mars ȝaf me myn hardynesse
Myn ascendent was taur and mars ther Inne
Allas allas that euere loue was synne
I folwede ay myn Inclynacyoun
By vertu of myn constolacioun
That made me that I coude nat withdrawe
Myn chambere of venus from a good felawe
ȝit haue I Martes mark vpon myn face
And also in anothyr preue place
ffor god so wis be myn sauacyoun
I ne lewede neuere by non discrecyoun
But euere folwede myn apetit
Al were he schort or long or blak or whȝt
I tok no kep so þat he lykede mee
How pore ne ek o what degree
What schal I sey but at þe monethis ende
This Ioly clerk Iankyn that was so hynde
Hath wedede me with gret solempnetee
And to hym ȝaf I al that lond and fee
That euere was me ȝeuyn þere byfoore
But aftyrward me repentede sone therfore
He nolde suffere no thyng of myn lyst
But onys he smot me with hyse fyst
ffor I rente onys out of hyse bok a lef
That for the strok myn ere wex al def
  
Styborne I was as a leonesse
And of myn tunge a veray Iangeleresse
And walke I wolde as  hadde don byforn
ffrom hous to hous althow he hadde it sworn
ffor whiche ofte tymys he wolde preche
And me olde romayn geestys teche
How he symplycious Gallus lafte his wyf
And hire for sok for terme of al his lyf
Not but for o poynt he hyre say
Lokynge out of hyse dore vpon a day
Anothir Romayn tolde he by name  
That for hise wif was at a somer game
Withoutyn hyse wetynge he forsok hire eke
And thanne wolde he vpon hise bible seeke
That ilke prouerbe of ecclesiaste
Where he comaundyth and forbedyth faste
Men schal not suffere here wyvis to roule aboute
Thanne wolde he seye thus withoutyn doute
Whoso byldyth hise hous al of salwys
And prikyth hyse blynde hors ouere þe falewis
And sufferith his wyf go sekyn halwys
Is worthi to been hangyn on the galwis
But al for nouȝt I sette nat an hawe
Of hise prouerbis ne of hise olde sawe
Ne I nulde of hym corectede be
I hate hym that mynne vicis tellyn me
And so don mo god wot than I
This made hym holde me wood al outerely
I nolde forbere hym in no manere cas
Now wele I sey ȝow soth by seynt Thomays
Whi that I rente out of hise bok a lef
ffor whyche he smot me that I was def
He hadde a bok that gladly nyȝt and day
ffor his disport he wolde rede alway
He clepede it valerye and theofraste
At which bok he low ful faste
  
And ek he seyde that sumtyme there was a clerk at rome
A cardenale that hyȝt Ierome
That made a bok aȝen Iouynian
In whiche bok þere was ek Tertulan
Crisippus Tortula and Helowys
That was abbesse not fer from Parys
And ek the parabele of Salamon
Ouydis art and bokys many on
And alle these were boundyn In on volome
And euery day and nyȝt was hyse custome
Whan he hadde leyse and vacacyoun
ffrom oþere wordely ocupacyoun
To redyn on hise bok of wekede wyuys  
He knew of hem mo legendys and lyuys
Than ben of goode wyuys in the byble
ffor trostyth wel it is an Impossible
That any clerk schulde speke good of wyuys
But ȝif it be of holye seyntis lyuys
Ne of non othere woman neuere þe mo
Who peyntede þe lyoun tel me who
Bi god ȝif women haddyn wretyn storyis
As clerkis han with inne here oratoryis
They wolde a wrete of men more wekedenesse
Than al þe Mark of adam may redresse
The chylderyn of mercurye and of venus
Ben in hyre werkys wol contraryous
Mercurye louyth wysdom and science
And venus louyth riot and dispence
And for hire dyuerse dispocicioun
Eche fallyth in oþeris exsaltacyoun
And þus wot god Mercurye is desolat
In Pisses where Mercurye is exaltat
And venus fallyth where Mercurye is reysed
Therfore no woman of no klerk is preysed
The clerk whan he is old and may not do
Of venus werkys worth hyse olde scho
  
Thanne sit he doun and wryt in hise dotage
That wemen kunne not kepe here maryage
But now to purpos why I tolde the
That I was betyn for a bok pardee
Vpon a nyȝt Iankyn that was oure syre
Radde on his bok as he sat by the fyre
Of Eua fyrst that for hyre wikkedenes
Was al mankynde brouȝt to wrechedenes

That boughte vs with his herte blode agayne
Lo here expresse of women Maye ye ffynde
That women was the losse of All Mankynde  
Tho radde he me how sampson loste hyse heris
Slepynge his leman kitte hem with hyre scherys
Thorgh whych tresoun loste he bothe hyse eyen
Tho radde he me ȝif I schal nat lyen
Of ercules and of hyse dyanyre
That causede hym to sette hym selue a fyre
No thyng forgat he the care and the wo  
That socrates hadde with hyse wyuys two
How Exantippa caste pis vpon his hed
This sely man sat stylle as he were deed
He wypede his hed no more durste he seyn
But er thundyr stynte þere comyth a reyn
Of phasippa that was the queen of Crete
ffor schrewedenesse hym thouȝte the tale swete
ffy spek na more it is a gresely thyng
Of hire horrible lust and hire lykyng
Of clitemysta for hire lecherye
That falsely maade hire husbonde for to deye
He radde it with ful good deuocioun
He tolde me ek for what occasyoun
Amphiorax at thebes loste his lyf
Myn husbonde hadde a legende of his wyf
Eryphilem þat for an Ouche of gold
Hath priuyly on to þe grekys told
  
Where þat hyre husbonde hidde hym in a place
ffor whiche he hadde at thebes sory grace
Of lyma tolde he me and of lucye
Thy bothe made here housbondis for to dye
That on for loue that oþer for hate
Lyma hire housbonde on an euyn late
Enpoysounede hath for þat sche was his fo
Lucya lykerous louede hyre housbonde so
That he schulde alwey on hire thynke
Sche ȝaf hym swich a manere loue drynke
That he was ded er it was by þe morwe
And þus algatys housbondis haddyn sorwe
Thanne tolde he me how on latymyus
Compleynede to his felawe Arryus
That in hyse gardyn growede swych a tre
On whiche he seyde þat his wyuys thre
Hangede hem self for herte despitous
O leue brothir quod this Arryus
ȝif me a plante of that blyssede tre
And in myn gardyn schal it plauntede be
Of lattere date of wyuys þanne he radde  
That some han slayn here housbondis in here bedde
And leet hire lectour dyȝte hire al þe nyȝt
Whils þat þe cors lay in þe flor vpryȝt
And some han dryue a nayl in here brayn
Whils þat þey slepte and þus þey han hem slayn
Some han ȝeue hem poysoun in here drynk
He spak more harm than herte may bethynk
And þerwithal he knew mo prouerbis
Than in this world þere growe gres or erbis
Bet is quod he þat thyn habitacioun
Be with a lyoun or a foul dragoun
Than with a waman vsynge for to chyde
Betere is quod he hye in þe rof abyde
Than with a wekede woman doun in an hous
They ben so wekke and so contraryous
  
They hatyn that here housbondys louyn ay
He seyde a woman caste hire schame away
Whan sche caste of hire smok and ferþere mo
A fayr woman but sche be chast also
Is lik a golde ryng in a sowis nose
Ho wolde wene or ho wolde suppose
The wo that in myn herte was and pyne
And I saw þat he wolde neuere fyne
But redyn on hise cursede bok al nyȝt
Al sodeynly thre leuys haue I plyȝt
Out of his bok as he sat ful meke
And with myn fist so tok I hym on þe cheke
That in oure fyre he fyl bakward adoun
And he vp stirte as doth a wood lyoun
And with his fyst he smot me on the hed
That In the flor I lay as I were ded
And whan he saw how stylle I lay
He was agast and fledde away
Til at þe laste out of myn swow I breyde
O hast þou sleyn me thef I seyde
And þus for myn lond wilt þou mordere me
Er I be ded ȝit wele I kysse the
And ner he cam and knelede fayre adoun  
And seyde myn dere sistyr alysoun
Als helpe me god I schal þe neuere smyte
That I haue don It is thyn self to wyte
ffor ȝeue it me and þat I þe beseke
And ȝit eftsonys I hitte hym on the cleke
And seyde thef þus meche I may me wreke
Now wele I deye I may no lengere speke
But at þe laste with meche care and wo
We fille acordit by oure seluyn two
He ȝaf me al þe brydyl in myn hond
To haue gouernauns of hous and lond
And of his tunge and of his hond also
And made hym to brenne his bok ryȝt þo
  
And whanne I hadde Igetyn on to me
By maysterye al þe souereyntee
Thanne he seyde myn owene trewe wyf
Do as ȝe leste for terme of al ȝoure lyf
Keep thyn honour and thyn estat
Aftyr þat day we ne haddyn neuere debat
God help me so I was to hym as kynde
As ony wif from denmark vnto Inde
And as trewe and so was he to me
I preye to god þat sit in mageste
So blysse his soule for his mercy dere
Now wele I seye myn tale ȝif ȝe wele here
The frere low whan he hadde herd al this
Now dame quod he also haue I Ioye or blis
This is a long preamble of a tale
And whan þe somnour herde þe frere gale
Lo quod the sumnour bi goddys armys too
A frere wele entirmete hym euere mo
Lo goode men a flye and ek a frere
Wele falle in euery disch and matere
What spekyst þou of perambulacioun
What amble or trotte or pes or go sit doun
þou lettyst oure desport in þis matiere
ȝa wilt þou so syre somnour quod þe frere
Now by myn fey I schal er þat I go  
Telle of a sumnour a tale or too
That alle þe folk schul law he in þis place
Now ellis frere I beschrewe thyn face
Quod this sumnour and I beschrewe me
But ȝif I telle talis too or thre
Of freris er I come to Sidyngborne
That I schal make þyn herte for to moorne
  
ffor wel I wot þyn pacience is goon
Oure ost cryede pees and þat anon
And seyde lat þe woman telle hire tale
ȝe fare as folk dronke were of ale
Doth dame tellyth forth ȝoure tale and þat is best
Al redy sire quod sche ryght at ȝoure lest
ȝif I haue lycens of þis worþi frere
ȝis dame telle forth and I schal here
IN olde dayis of kyng Arthour
Of whiche þat brytons spekyn gret honour
Al was this lond ful fyld of fayrye
The elf quene wyth hire cumpanye
Dauncede ful ofte in manye a grene mede
This was the olde opynyoun as I rede
I speke of manye hunderede ȝeris ago
But now can no man se eluys mo
ffor now the charite and þe prayeris
Of lymytouris and of oþere holy frerys
That serchyn euery lond and euery strem
As thikke as motys in þe sone bem
Blessen halles chaumbery kichenys bourys
Ceteis borwys castelis hyghe tourys
Thropes bernys  Schipnes dayryis
That makyth that þere ben no fayryis
ffor þere as wont was for to walke an elf
There walkyth now þe lymytour hym self
In vndirmelys and in morwenyngis
And seyth hyse matynys and hyse holye thyngis
As he goth in hyse lymytacioun
Wemen mowe go sauely vp and doun
In euery bussch and vndyr euery tree
There is nower non Incubus but he
And he wele don hym non dishonour
And so befel þat this kyng Arthour
Hadde in his hous a ryche bacheler
That on a day cam rydynge from reuer
  
And happede alone as sche was born
He saw a mayde cam rydynge hym byforn
Of whiche maydyn anon maugry hire hed
By veray forse byrafte he hire maydynhed
ffor which apprecioun was swych clamour
And swych pursut to kyng arthour
That dampnede was the knyȝt for to be ded
By cours of lawe and schulde a lost hyse heed
Perauenture swich was the statute þo
But that þe queen and oþere ladyis moo
So longe preyedyn the kyng of grace  
Tyl he his lyf grauntede at þat place
And ȝaf hym to the queen at hire wille
To chese wheþer sche wolde hym saue or spille
The queen thankede þe kyng with al hyre myȝt
And aftyr this þus spak sche to þe knyȝt
Whan sche saw hyre tyme vpon a day
Thow stondist ȝit quod sche in swich aray
That of thyn lyf  hast no surete
I graunte þe lyf ȝif þou canst telle me
What thyng ist that wemen most desyryn
Bewar and kep thyn neke bon from yryn
And ȝif þou canst not telle me anon
ȝit wele I ȝeue þe leue for to goon
A twelvemonyth and a day to lere
An answere sufficiaunt in this matire
And surete wele I haue er þat þou pace
Thyn body for to ȝildyn in þis place
Wo was this knyȝt and sorwefully he sikede
But ȝit may he nat don as hym lykede
And at þe laste he ches hym for to weende
And come aȝen ryȝt at þe ȝerys ende
With swich answere as god wolde hym purueye
And takyth his leue and wendyth forth hyse weye
And sekyth euery hous and euery place
Where as he hopith to fynde grace
  
To lernyn what thyng wemen louyn most
But he ne coude aryuyn In no cost
Where as he myȝte fynde in this matyre
Two wightis acordyn in fyre
Some men seydyn women louyn best rychesse
Some men seyde honour some iolynesse
Some men seyde ryche aray some lust in bedde
And ofte tyme be wedewe and ofte Iwedde
Some men seyde oure herte is most Iesed
Whan þat we been Iflatered and Iplesed
He goth ful nygh þe sothe I nyl not lye
A man schal wynne vs best with flaterye
And with attendaunce and besynesse  
Be we Ilymyd boþe more and lesse
And some men seyn þat we louyn best
ffor to be fre and do ryȝt as vs lest
And þat no man repreue vs of oure vice
But seye þat we be wys and no thyng nyse
ffor trewely þere is non of vs alle
ȝif ony wyȝt wele clawe vs on the galle
That we nolde kyke for he seyth vs soth
Asay he schal fynde it þat so doth
ffor be we neuere so vicious withinne
We wele be holde wis and clene of synne
And some seyn that gret loue haue we
ffor to ben holde wyse and secre
And in on purpos stedefastly to dwelle
And not be wreye thyng þat men vs telle
But þat tale nys not worth a rake stele
Parde we wemen can nothyng hele
Witnesse of Mida wil ȝe here þe tale
Ouyde amongis oþere thyngis smale
Seyde Mida hadde vndyr hyse longe herys
Growynge on his hed two assis erys
The whiche vice he hyde as he best myghte
fful subtyly from euery manys syȝte
  
That saue his wyf þere wiste of it no mo
He louede hyre most and trostid to hyre also
He preyede hyre þat to no cryature
Sche schulde telle of his disfygure
Sche swor hym nay for al this world to wynne
Sche nolde not do þat vilany or synne
Go make hyre husbonde to haue so foul a name
Sche nele it telle for hyre owene schame
But neuereþeles hire thouȝte þat sche dyde
That sche so longe a conseylde hyde
Hire thouȝte it swal so sore aboute hyre herte
That nedely sum word muste asterte
And sythe sche durste telle it to no man
Doun to a mareys faste by sche ran
Tyl sche cam þere hire herte was a fyre  
And as a bitore bumbith in þe myre
Sche leyde hyre mouth to þe watyr adoun
Bewrey me not þou watyr with thyn soun
Quod sche to þe I telle it and no mo
Myn husbonde hath longe erys too
Now is al myn herte hol now is it oute
I myȝte no lengere kepe it out of doute
Here may ȝe se þow we no tyme abyde
ȝit out mote it we can no conseyl hyde
The remenaunt of þe tale ȝif ȝe wele here
Rede ouyde and þere mowe ȝe it leere
This knyȝt of which myn tale is specyally
Whan he saw he myȝte not come þerby
This is to seye what wemen louyn most
Withinne his brest full sorwefully was þe gost
But hom he goth he myȝte not soiorne
The day was come that homward muste he turne
And In hyse wey as happede hym to ryde
In al hise care vndyr a forest syde
Where as he saw vpon a daunce go
Of ladyis foure and twenty and ȝit mo
  
Toward þis dauns he drow ful ȝerne
In hope þat sum wisdam schulde he lerne
But serteyn fully er he cam ther
Vanysschid was the daunce he nyste wher
No cryateure saw he þat bar lyf
Saue on þe grene he saw syttynge a wyf
A foulere wyȝt þere may no man devyse
Aȝens þis knyȝt this olde whiȝt gan ryse
And seyde syre knyȝt here forth lyth no weye

Koude ȝe me wische I wolde quyte ȝoure hyre
Plyghte me þyn treuth in myn hond quod sche

Thow shalt it do ȝif it be in þy myght
And I wele telle it ȝow er it be nyght
Haue her myn trouthe quod þe knyght I graunte
Thanne quod sche I dar me wel avaunte
Thyn lyf is saf I wele stonde þerby
Vpon myn lyf þe quen wele seye as I
Lat se which is þe proudest of hem alle
That weryth on a couerechief or a calle
Tha dar sey nay of þat I schal the teche
Lat vs go forth with oute lengere speche
Tho rounnede sche a pistyl in hyse ere
And bad hym to be glad and haue no fere
Whan þey been comyn to þe court þis knyȝt
Seyde þat he hadde holde his day þat he hyȝt
And redy was his answere as he sayde
fful manye a nobele wyf and manye a mayde
And manye a wedewe for þat þey ben wyse
The queen hire self syttynge as a iustyse
  
Assembelede been his answerys for to here
And aftyrward þis knyȝt was bode to pere
To euery wyȝt was comaundede silence
And þat þe knyȝt schulde telle in audyence
What thyng þat wordely women louyn best
The knyȝt stod not stille as a beest
But to his questioun anon answerde
With manly voys þat al þe court it herde
Myn lige lady generally quod he
Wemen desyryn to han souereynte
As wel ouyr hire husbondis as ouer hire hove
And for to been in maystrye hem aboue
This is þe moste desyr thow ȝe me kylle
Doth as ȝow leste I am al at ȝoure wille
In al þe court ne was þere wif ne mayde
Ne wedewe contraryede þat he sayde
But seydyn þat he was worthi to han his lyf
And with that word vp sterte þe olde wyf
Whiche þat þe knyȝt saw syttynge on þe grene  
Mercy quod sche myn souereyn lady quene
Er þat ȝoure court departe doth me ryght
I taughte this answere to þe knyth
ffor which he plyȝte me his trouthe þere
The fyrste thyng þat I wolde hym requere
He wolde it do ȝif it lay in his myȝt
Byfore þe court þanne preye I þe syre knyȝt
Quod sche þat þou me take on to þyn wyf
ffor weel þou wist þat I haue kept þyn lyf
ȝif I seye fals say nay vpon þy fey
This knyȝt answerde allas and weyleawey
I wot ryȝt wel þat swich was myn beheste
ffor goddys loue as ches a newe requeste
Tak al myn good and lat myn body goo
Nay þanne quod sche I be schrewe vs boþe too
ffor þow I be foul old and pore
I nolde for al þe metal ne for ore
  
That vndyr þe erþe is graue or lyth aboue
But ȝif þyn wyf I were and ek þyn loue
Myn loue quod he nay myn dampnacyoun
Allas þat ony of myn nacyoun 
Schulde euere so foule disparagit be
But al for nouȝt þanne is þis quod sche
Constreynede was he nedys he muste hyre wedde
And takyth his olde wif and goth to bedde
Now wil some men seye parauenture
That for myn neclygens I do no cure
To telle ȝow þe ioye and also tharray
That at þat ilke feste was þat day
To whiche thyng sothely I answere schal
And seye þere was no Ioye ne feste at al
There was but heuynesse and meche sorwe
ffor priuyly he wedde hire in þe morwe
And al day aftyr hydde hym as an houle
So 1wo was1 hym his wyf lokede so foule
Gret was þe wo þe knyȝt hadde in his thouȝt
Whan he was wyth his wyf in bedde Ibrouȝt
He walwith and he turnyth too and fro  
This olde wif lay smylynge euere mo
And seyde o dere husbende benedicite
ffaryth euery knyȝt with his wyf as ȝe
Is þis þe lawe of kyng arthures hous
Is euery knyȝt of his þus daungerous
I am ȝoure owene loue and ȝoure wyf
I am sche þat sauede hath ȝoure lyf
And sertis I dede ȝow neuere vnryȝt
Whi fare ȝe þus with me þe ferste nyȝt
ȝe fare lyk a man þat hadde lost his wit
What is myn gilt for godis loue telle me it
And it schal been amendit ȝif þat I may
Amendit quod this knyȝt allas nay nay
It wele not been amendit neuere mo
Thow art so loothly old and so pore also
  
And þerto comyn of so low a kynde
That lytyl wondir ist þow I walwe and wynde
So wolde god myn herte wolde breste
Is þis quod sche þe cause of ȝoure onreste
ȝa serteynly quod he no wondir is
Now sere quod sche I coude amende al þis
ȝif þat me lyste er it were dayis thre
So wel myȝte ȝe bere ȝow to me
But for ȝe speke of swich gentillesse
As is dessendit out of olde richesse
That þerfore schul ȝe ben holdyn gentil men
Swich arrogaunce is not worth an hen
Loke ho þat is most verteuous alwey
Pryue and apert and most entendyth ay
To do þe gentyl dedys þat he can
Take hym for þe gretteste gentil man
Cryst wele we cleyme of hym oure gentylesse
Noght of oure elderys for oure olde rychesse
ffor þow þey ȝeue vs al here erytage
ffor which we cleymyn to been of high parage
ȝit may þey not byquethe for no thyng
To noon of vs here verteuous lyuyng
That made hem gentylmen Icallede be  
And bad vs foldyn hem in swich degre
Weel can þe wise poete of florence
That hyȝt dant declare þis centence
Lo in swych a manere rym is dantes tale
fful selde vp rysith by hyse braunchis smale
Prowesse of man for god of his prowesse
Wele þat we cleyme of hym oure gentillesse
ffor of oure eldere we may no thyng cleyme
But temperel thyng þat man may hurte and mayme
Ek euery wyȝt wot þis as wel as I
ȝif gentillesse were plantid naturelly
Vp to a certeyn lennage doun be lyne
Preue nor apert þanne wolde þey neuere fyne
  
To don of gentillesse þe offys
They myȝte don no vilenye nor vice
Tak fyr and bere in þe derkeste hous
Betwyxe this and þe mount of Cankerous
And let men schette þe dore and go þenne
ȝit wil þe fyr lye as fyr and brenne
As twenty thousent men myȝte it byholde
His offise naturel ay wel it holde
Vp peril of myn lyf tyl þat it deye
Here may ȝe wel sen how þat genterye
Is not annexed to possescioun
Sithe folk ne don here operacioun
Alwey as doth the fyr in hise kynde
ffor I wot men may ful ofte fynde
A lordis sone do schame and vilanye
And he þat wele haue prys of his genterye
ffor he was bore of a gentyl hous
And hadde hise olderis nobele and vertuous
And nyle hym self don non gentyle dedis
Ne folwe his gentyle auncetere þat deed is
He nys not gentyl be he duk or el
ffor violens synful dedys make eke a cherl
ffor gentillesse nys but renomee
Of thynne auncestris for here hygh bounte
Whiche is a strong thyng to thyn persone  
The gentillesse comyth from god alone
Thanne comyth oure verray gentillesse of grace
It was no thyng bequethe vs with oure place
Thynkith how nobele as seyth valerius
Was that ilke tullius hostilius
That out of pouert ros to gret noblesse
Redyth senec and redith eek boece
Ther schul ȝe se expres þat no dred is
That he is gentyl that doth gentyl dedis
And þerfore leue husbonde I thus conclude
Al were it þat myne auncestris were reude
  
ȝit may þe hye god and so hope I
Graunte me grace to leue verteuosly
Thanne am I gentyl whan þat I begynne
To leuyn verteuously and leuyn synne
And þere as ȝe of pouert me repreue
The hye god of whom ȝe me repreue
In wilful pouert ches to lede his lyf
And certys euery man mayde or wyf
May vndyrstondyn Ihesus heuene kyng
Ne wolde not chese an vicious leuyng
Glad pouert is an oneste thyng certeyn
This wele Senek and oþere clerkys seyn
Ho so hym halt payed of his pouerte
I holde hym ryche hadde he but a sherte
He þat coueytyth is a pore wight
ffor he wolde han þat is not in his myȝt
But he þat nought haht ne coueythit to haue
Is riche althow men holde hym but a knaue
Veray pouert it syngith properly
Iuenal seyth of pouerte meryly
The poure man whan he goth by the weye
Byfore þe thewis he may synge and pleye
Pouerte is hateful good as I gesse
A ful gret bryngere out of besinesse
A gret amendere ek of sapience
To hem þat takyth it in pacience
Pouerte is this althow it seme alenge  
Possessioun þat no man wele calenge
Pouerte ful ofte whan a man is lowe
Makyth his god and hym self to knowe
Pouerte a spectakele is as thynkyth me
Thorw whech he may his veray frend Ise
And þerfore syre syn þat I ȝow not greue
Of myn pouerte no more ȝe me repreue
Now syre of olde ȝe repreue me
And sertis syde thogh non autoryte
  
Were in no bok the gentylys of honour
Seyn þat men schuld an old wyȝt don fauour
And clepyn hym fadyr of ȝoure gentilesse
And auctouris schal I fyndyn as I gesse
Now þere ȝe seyn I am foul and old
Thanne drede ȝow not to ben a coukewold
ffylthe and elde alsomote I the
Ben gret wardaynys vpon chastite
But natheles sythe I knowe ȝoure delyt
I schal fulfylle ȝoure wordely apetyt
Chese now quod sche on of þese thyngis tweye
To haue me foul and old tyl þat I deye
And be to ȝow a trewe vmble wyf
And neuere ȝow displese in al myn lyf
Or ellis ȝe wele haue me ȝyng and fayr
And take þe auenture of the repayr
That schal be to ȝoure hous be cause of me
Or in sum oþer place may wel be
Now cheseth ȝoure selue wheþer þat ȝow likyth
This knyȝt auyseth hym and sore sykyth
But at þe laste he seyde in þis manere
Myn lady and myn loue and myn wyf so dere
I putte me in ȝoure wise gouernaunce
Cheseth ȝoure self whiche may be most plesaunce
And most honour to ȝow and me also
I do no fors wheþer of the too
ffor as ȝow lykyth it suffyseth me
Thanne haue I gete þe maysterye quod sche
Syn I may chese and gouerne as me leste  
ȝa sertys wif quod he I helde it for þe beste
Kis me quod sche we be no lengere wrothe
ffor be myn trouthe I wele be to ȝow bothe
That is to seyne bothe fayr and good
I preye to god I mote sterwe wod
But I to ȝow be al so good and trewe
As euere was wyf syn þat þe world was newe
  
And but I be to morwe as fayr to sene
As eny lady Emperesse or quene
That euere was betwixse þe Est and þe west
Doth with myn lyf and doth ryȝt as ȝow lest
Cast vp þe curtyn and loke how þat it is
And whan þat þe knyght saw verrayly al þis
That sche so fayr was and so ȝyng þerto
ffor ioye he hente hyre in hise armys too
His herte bathit in a bath of blys
A thousent sythe a rowe he gan hire kys
And sche obeyede hym in euery thyng
That myȝte do hym plesaunce or lykyng
And þus þey lyue vnto here lyuys ende
In parfyt Ioye and Ihesu crist vs synde
Husbondis meke ȝinge and frosche in bedde
And grace to ouer byde hem þat we wedde
And ek I preye Ihesu schorte here lyuys
That wele not been gouernyd by here wyuys
And olde and angery nygardys of dispence
God sende hem sone verray pestelence

he made alweie a maner louryng chere 
vpon the Sompnour but yet for honeste 
No vilenous worde as yet spak he 
But at the laste he seide vnto the wif 
Dame gode god yeue you right good lif 
Ye han touched here also mote I the 
In scole mater gret difficulte 
Ye han seide mochell thyng right well I seie   
But dame here as we riden bi the weie 
Vs nedith not to speken but of game 
And late auctorites go a goddis name 
To prechyng and to scole eke of clergie 
But if it like vnto this companye 
I will you of a somnour telle a game 
Parde ye may well knowe be the name 
That of no somnour may no gode be saide 
I praye that non of you be euyll apaide 
A Somnour is a romere vp and doun 
With maundementis of ffornycacioun 
And is bete at euery townes ende 
Our oost tho spak a sir ye schulde ben hende 
And curteis as man of your estate 
In companye we woll no debate 
Telleth your tale and lateth the Somnour be 
Nay quod the Somnour late hym saie to me
What so hym list whan it cometh to my lot 
Bi god I schall hym quyte euery grot 
I schall hym telle whiche a gret honour 
It is to be a flateryng lymytour 
And eek of full manye another cryme 
Whiche nedith not rehersen at this tyme 
And his office I schall hym telle ywis 
Our hoste answerid pees no more of this 
And aftirwarde he seide vnto the ffrere 
Tell forth your tale my leue maister dere 
WHilom ther was dwellyng in my contre 
An Erchedekene a man of hye degre 
That boldely dide execucioun 
In ponyschyng of ffornycacioun 
Of wicchecrafte and eek of baudrie 
Of diffamacioun and avoutrie 
Of chirche reeues and of testamentis 
Of contractis and of lak of sacramentis 
Of vsure and Symonye also 
But certis lecchours dide he most wo 
Thei schulden syngen if thei were hent 
And smale tithers weren foule schent 
Yf ony persone wolde vpon hem pleyne 
Ther myght asterte hym no pecunyall peyne 
ffor smale tithes and eek smale offerynge 
he made the peple spitously to synge 
ffor or the Bischop caughte hem with his hooke 
Thei weren in the Erchedekenes booke 
And then had he thorow his Iurdiccion   
Power to doon on hem correccion 
he had a Sompnour redy to his honde 
A slier boie was non in Engelonde 
ffor subtily he hadde hise expyayle  
That tauȝte hym where hym myȝte avayle
He coude spare of lechourys on or two
To techyn hym to foure and twenty mo
ffor þow þis somenour wood were as an hare
To telle his harloterye I wele not spare
  
ffor we ben out of his coreccioun
They han of vs no Iurediccioun
Ne neuere ne schuln of alle here lyuys
Petyr so been wemen at þe styuys
Quod þe somenour Iput out of oure cure
Pees with myschaunce and with mysauenture
Thus seyde oure ost and lat hym telle his tale
Now tellith forth þow þat þe somenour gale
Ne sparyth not myn owene maystyr dere
This false thef þis somenour quod þe frere
Hadde alwey baudys redy to his hond
As ony hauk to lure in ingelond
That tolde hym al þe secre þat þey knewe
ffor hire aqueyntauns was not comyn of newe
They were hise apprououris pryuyly
He tok hym self a profyt þerby
His maystyr knew not alwey what he wan
Withoutyn maundement a lewede man
He coude somounne vp peyne of crystis curs
And þey were ful glad to fille his purs
And made hym noble festis at þe nale
And ryȝt as Iudas hadde purse smale
And was a thef ryȝt swich a thef was he
Hise mayster hadde but half his duete
He was ȝif I schal ȝeuyn hym hise lawede
A thef and ek a somenour and a baude
He hadde ek wenchis at his retenew
That wheþer syre Robert oþer syre Hewe
Or Iakke or Raf or who so þat it were
That lay by hem þey tolde it in hise ere
Thus was þe wenche and he at on assent
And he wolde feche a feynede maundement
And somoune hem to chapitere boþe two  
And pile þe man and lete þe wenche go
Thanne wolde he sey frend I schal for thyn sake
Don stryke þe out of oure letteris blake
  
The thar no more as in þis cas trauayle
I am thyn frend þere I þe may avayle
Certeyn he knew of bryberyis mo
Than possible is to telle in ȝeris two
ffor in þis world nys doge for þe bowe
Than kan an hurt der from an hol knowe
Bet þan þe somenour knew a sly lechour
Or auoutir or a paramour
And for þat was þe freut of al his rente
Therfore he sette on it al hyse entente
And so befel þat onys on a day
This somenour euere waytynge on hyse pray
Wente for to somounne a wedewe an old rybibe
ffeynynge a cause for he wolde brybe
And happede he saw byfore hym ryde
A gay ȝeman vndir a forest syde
A bowe he bar and arwis bryȝte and kene
He hadde upon a courtepy of grene
An hat vpon his hed with frengis blake
Syre quod þe somenour wel atake
Wolcome quod he and euery good felawe
Wheþer rydistow vndyr þis grene wode schawe
Seyde þis ȝeman wilt þou fer to day

Depardeus quod þis ȝeman leue broþer

And sparyth not for concience ne for synne
But as myn broþer telle me how do ȝe
Now by myn trouthe broþer dere seyde he

And myn offys is ful laberous
And þerfore by extorciounnys I leue

Algate by sleyȝte or by violence

Now sertis quod þis somenour so fare I

And sumtyme be we sufferede for to sek

And answere þere by myn procatour
To swich thyng as men wele oposyn me

Twelue penys lat se and I wele þe aquyte

Come of and let me rydyn hastely
ȝeue me twelve penys I may no lengere lette
Twelue penys quod sche now lady seynte marye
So wysely helpe me out of care and synne
This wyde world þow þat I schulde wynne
Ne haue I not twelue penys withinne myn holld
ȝe knowe wel þat I am pore and old
Kythe ȝoure almesse on me pore wreche
Nay þanne quod he þe fend me feche

Allas quod sche god wot I haue no gilt
Pay me quod he or be swete seynt anne

Thow lyxt quod sche be myn sauacyoun
Ne was I neuere er no wedewe ne wyf
Somounede on to ȝoure court in al myn lyf
Ne neuere I nas but of myn body trewe
Vnto þe deuyl blak and row of hewe

And whan þe deuyl herde hire curse so
Vpon hire kneis sche seyde on þis manere
Now mabelyn myn owene modir dere
Is þis ȝoure wille in ernest þat ȝe seye
The deuyl quod sche so feche hym er he deye
And panne and al but he wele hym repente
Nay olde stot þat is not myn entente

ffor eny þenge þat I haue hade of þe

Nowe Broþer quod þe Deuyll be not wrothe
Thy body and þis panne ys myne by riȝt

More þan a Maystre of Diuinite
And with þat worde þe foule fende hym hent
Body and soule with þe fende went
Where þat Somonours haue hir herytage
And god þat made aftyr hys Image
Mankynde saue and gyde vs alle and somme
And leue þis Somonour gode man bycome
Lordynges I coude a tolde you quod þe frere  
Hade I hade leyser of thys Somnour here
After þe Tyxt Cryst poule and Iohn 
And of other doctours many on 
Suche peynes þat youre hertes may agryse 
Also by hyt þat no þenge may deuyse 
Thou þat I myȝt a þousand wynter telle 
The peyne of þilke Cursed house of helle 
  
But for to kepe vs fro þat cursed place
Wakethe and preithe Ihesu for his grace
To kepe vs  fro þe Temptour Sathanas
herken þis worde be ware in þis caas
The lyonn sit in his wayt alway
To sle þe Innocent yf þat he may
Disposethe ay youre hertes to withstonde

And Cryst woll be youre Champioun and your knyȝt
And preythe þat þis Sompnour hym repent
Of hys mysdede or þe fende hym hent
THis Somnour in his stirop hye stood 
Vpon this ffrere his herte was so wood 
That like an Aspen leef he quoke for yre 
Lordyngis quod he but oo thyng I desire 
I you beseke that of your curtesie 
Sethyns ye han herd this fals ffrere lye 
As suffreth me I maye a tale telle   
This ffrere bosteth that he knoweth helle 
And god woot that it is litell wondir
ffreres and fendes ben but litell a sondir
ffor parde ye han ofte tyme herd telle 
how that a ffrere rauysched was in to helle 
In spirit onys by a visioun 
And as an angell lad hym vp and doun 
To schewyn hym the peynes that ther were 
In all the place sawe he not a ffrere 
Of other folke he sawe ynow in woo 
Vnto this angell spake the ffrere tho 
Now sir quod he han ffreres suche grace 
That non of hem schall come to this place 
Yes quod this angell manye a mylioun 
And vnto Sathanas he lad hym adoun 
And now hath Sathanas saith he a taile 
Bradder then of the Carik is the saile 
Holde vp thyn taile Sathanas quod he 
Schewe forth thyne ers and lete the ffrere se 
Where is the neste of ffreres in this place 
And er that half a forlong wey of space 
  
Right so as Bees swermen out of an hyue 
Out of the deuylles ers thei gon dryue 
xxti thousande ffreris on a route 
And thorowout helle swarmed all aboute 
And camen ayen as fast as thei may gone 
And in his ers thei crepedyn euerichone 
He clapt his tale ayen and laye still 
This ffrere when he lokid had his fill 
Vpon this tormentis of this sory place 
his spirit god restorid of his grace 
Vnto his bodye ayen and he awoke 
But natheles for fere yet he quoke 
So was the deuelis ars ay in his mynde 
That is his heritage of verrey kynde 
God saue you alle saue this cursid ffrere 
Mi Prolog woll I ende in this manere 
LOrdyngis ther is in york schire as I gesse
A merschy contre called holdernesse
In whiche ther wente a lymytour aboute
To preche and eek to begge it is no doute
And so bifell that on a daye this ffrere
had preched at chirche in this manere
And specially abouyn euery thyng
Excited he the peple in his prechyng
To trentalis and to yeue for goddis sake  
Wherwith men myghte holi housis make
Ther as deuyne seruyse is honoured
Nought ther as it is wasted and deuoured
Ne there it nedith not for to be yeue
As to possessioners that may ellis lyue
Thanked be god in wele and habundaunce
Trentales seide he delyuerith fro penaunce
Here frendes soules as well olde as yong
Yef that thei ben hastely song
Nought for to holde a preest ioly and gay
he syngeth not but oo messe in a day
Delyuerith out a man quod he the soulis
ffull hard it is with fleschehoke or with oulis
Now spede you hastely for cristes sake
To kepe you fro peynes of fendis blake
And whan the ffrere had seide alle his entente
With Qui cum patre forth he wente
When folke in chirche had yeue hym what hem lest
he wente his way no lenger wolde he rest
  
With scrippe and tipped staf tucked full hye
In euery hous he gan to pore and prye
And beggeth mele or chese or ellis corn
his felalawe had a staf tipped with horn
A peire of tablis of yuory
And a poyntell polched fetisly
And wrot alweye the names there he stood
Of alle folke that yaf hym any good
Ascaunce as he wolde for hem preie
Yeue vs a buschell whete malt or reie
A godis kechil or a trip of chese  
Or ellis what ȝow lyste we may not chese
A godis halpeny or a masse pany
Or ȝeue vs of ȝoure braun ȝif ȝe han any
A dagoun of ȝoure blanket leue dame
Oure sistyr dere lo here I wryte ȝoure name
Bacoun or bef or swich þyng as ȝe fynde
A sturdy harlot wente hem ay byhynde
That was here ostys man and bar a sak
And what men ȝoue hem leyde it on his bak
And whan he was out at þe dore anon
He planede awey þe namys euerychon
That he before hadde wrytyn in hyse tablis
He servede hem with nyflys and wyth fablys
Nay þere þou lext þou somenour quod þe frere
Pes quod oure ost for cristis modyr dere
Telle forth ȝoure tale and spare it not at al
So thryue I quod the somenour so I schal
So longe he wente hous be hous tyl he
Cam to an hous þere he was wone to be
Refresched more þan in an hunderede placis
Sek lay þe goode man whos þe place is
Bedrede vpon a couche lowe he lay
Deus hic quod he O tomays frend good day

Haue I vpon þis benche fare ful wel

And fro þe bench he drof awoy þe cat
And leyde adoun his potente and his hat
And ek his scryppe and sette hym softe adoun

Where as he schop hym þe ilke nyȝt to lye
O dere maystir quod þis syke man

And spcially for thyn saluacioun  
Haue I seyd manye a precious orisoun
And for oure oþere frendis god hem blysse

And seyd a sarmoun aftyr myn symple wit

And þerfore wele I telle ȝow al þe glose

And spende here good þere it is resonable
And þere I saw oure dame a where is sche

And hire enbraseth in hise armys narwe
And kysseth hire swete  and chirketh as a sparwe
With his lippis dame quod he ryȝt wel
As he þat is ȝoure seruaunt euerydel
Thankede be god þat ȝow ȝaf soule and lyf

In schrifte in prechynge is myn diligence
And stodie in peteris wordis and in Poulis

To ȝilde Ihesu crist  hise propere rente
To sprede his word is set al myn entente
Now by ȝoure leue o deere maystyr quod sche  
Schidith hym wel for seynte trynyte

Thow I hym wrye a nyȝt and make hym warm
And ouer hym leye myn leg oþer myn arm
He gronyth lik oure bor lyth in oure sty
Oþer disport ryȝt non of hym haue I
I may not plese hym in no manere cas
O Thomas Ie vous dy Thomas Thomas

And of ȝoure softe bred but a scheuere
And aftyr þat a rostede pigis hed
But þat I nolde no beste for me were ded
Thanne hadde I with ȝow homely suffysaunce

Myn spirit hath his fosterynge in þe bible

To wake þat myn stomak is distroyed

Aftyr his deth I saw hym bore to blysse
In myn auysioun god so me wisse
So dede oure sexteyn and oure fermorer
That han ben trewe frerys fifty ȝer
They may now god be thanked of his lone  
Makyn here Iubyle and walkyn alone
And vp I ros and al oure couent ek

And more we sen of secre thyngis
Than burel folk al þow þey were kyngis

And burel folk in rychesse and dispence
In mete and drynk and in here foule delyt
We han þis wordelis lust al in dispit

And dyuers gerdoun haddyn þey þerby
Ho so wele preye  hym muste faste and be clene
And fattyn his soule and make his body leene

Resseyuede he þe lawe þat was wretyn
With godis fyngir and elye wolde wetyn
In Mount oreb er he hadde any speche
With hye god þat is oure lyuys leche
He fastede longe and was in contemplaunce

And ek þe oþere postellis euerychon
Into þe temple whan þey schulde gon

No drynk whiche þat myȝte hem dronke make  
But þere in abstinence preye and wake
Lest þat þey dey dyn tak hede what I seye
But þey ben sobere þat for þe puple preye
War þat I seye no more for it suffyseth
Oure lord Ihesu as holy wryt deuyseth

Therefore we mendynauntis we frerys

To charite humblenesse and pacience
To persecucion for rightwisnesse
To wepyng mysericord and clennesse
And therfore maye ye se that our praieres

And chaast was man in paradys serteyn
But herke now thomas what I schal seyn

What nedyth ȝow dyuers frerys seche
What nedyth hym þat hath a parfit leche
To sechyn oþere lechis in þe toun
Ȝoure inconstaunce is ȝoure confusioun
Holde ȝe þanne me or ellis oure couent
To preye for ȝow ben ensufficient
Thomas þat Iape nys nat worth a myte
Ȝoure malady is for ȝe han to lyte
A ȝif þat couent half a quarter otys
And ȝif þat couent foure and twenty grotis
And ȝif þat frere a peny and lat hym go
Nay nay Thomas It may no thyng be so
What is a ferthyg worth partid on twelve
Lo eche thyng þat is onyd in hym selue

As for myn self but þat al oure couent
To preye for ȝow is ay so diligent
And for to bildyn cristis owene chyrche

Of bildyng vp of cherchis may ȝe fynde
Ȝif it be good in Thomas lyf of ynde
Ȝe lye here ful of anguyssch and of yre  
With wych þe deuyl set ȝoure hette afyre
And chidyn here þis sely innosent

And þerfore Thomas trowe me if þe lest
Ne stryue nat with þyn wif as for þe best
And bere þis word awoy now be þyn feyth
Touchynge swich thyng lo as þe wyse seyth
  
Withinne þyn hous ne be þou no lyoun
To þynne subiectis do non oppressioun

Now sithe ȝe han so holy meke a wyf
What nedyth ȝow Thomas to makyn stryf
There is I wis no serpent so crewel
Whan man trat on his tayl ne half so fel
As woman is whan sche hath cauȝt an yre
Veniaunce is þanne al þat þey desyre
Ire is a synne on of þe gretteste of synnys
Abomynable vnto þe god of heuene
And to hym self it is distruxcioun
This euery lewede veker or parsoun
Kan seen how yre engenderyth homysyde
Ire is in soth executour of pryde
I coude of Ire sey so meche sorwe
Myn tale schulde laste tyl to morwe
And þerfore preye I god boþe day and nyȝt
An yrous man god sende hym lityl myȝt
It is gret harm and ek greet pete
To sette an yrous man in heigh degre
 Whylom þere was an yrous potestat
As seyth Senek þat durynge his estat
Vpon a day out rydyn knyȝtis too  
And as fortune wolde þat it were so
That on of hem cam hom þat oþer nouȝt

That seyde þus þou hast þyn felawe slayn
ffor which I deme þe to þe deth sertayn
  
And to anoþer knyȝt comaundede he
Go lede hym to þe deth I charge þe
And happid as þey wente by þe weye
Toward þe place þere he schulde deye
The knyȝt cam which men wende he hadde be ded
Thanne thouȝte þey it was þe beste red
To leede hem boþe to þe Iuge ageyn
They seyde lord þe knyght ne hath not slayn
His felawe here he stondyth hol aloone
Ȝe schul ben ded anoon so mote I gone
That is to seyne boþe on and too and thre
And to þe ferste knyȝt þus spak he

And þou also muste nedys lese þyn hed
ffor þou art cause whi thyn felawe deyeth
And to þe thredde knyȝt ryȝt þus he seyeth
Thow hast not don þat I comaundede þe
And þus he dede hem slen alle thre
Irous Cambises was ek dronkelewe
And ay delitede hym to ben a schrewe
And so befel a lord of his meyne
That louede verteuos moralite
Seyde on a day betwixe hem ryȝt þus
A lord is lost ȝif he be vicious
And dronkenes is ek a foul record
In any man and namely in a lord
There is ful manye an ye and manye an ere
Awaytynge on a lord and he not where
ffor godys loue drynk more atemperelly
Wyn makyth man to lesyn wrechedely
His mynde and hyse lymys euerychon
The reuers schal þou sen and þat anon
And preve it by thyn owene experyence  
That wyn ne doth to folk non swich offence
There is no wyn bereuyth me myn myȝt
Of hond ne foot ne of myn eye syȝt
  
And for despit he drank mekyl þe more
An hunderede part than he hadde don byfore
And ryȝt anon þis yrous cursede wreche
Leet þis knyȝt sone byfore hym feche
Comaundynge hym he schulde byfore hym stonde
And sodeynly he tok his bowe on honde
And vp þe stryng he pullede to hyse ere
And with an arwe he slow þe child ryȝt þere
Now wheþer haue I sekyr hand or non
Quod he is al myn myȝt and mynde agon
Hath wyn bereuyd me myn eyen syth
What schulde I telle þe answere of þe knyȝt
His sone was slaye þere is no more to seye
Beth war þerfore with lordys how ȝe pleye
Syng placebo and I schal ȝif i can
But ȝif it be vnto a pore man
To a pore man men schulde his vicis telle
But not to a lord þow he schulde go to helle
Lo yrous Cyrus thilke percyen
How he distroyed þe Ryuer of Gyseen
ffor þat an hors of his was drenkt þerinne
Whan þat he wente babylonye to wynne
He made þat þe ryuer was so smal
That wemen myghte wade it oueral
Lo what seyde he þat so wel teche can
Ne be no felawe to an yrous man
Ne wyth no wood man walke by þe weye
Lest þe repente I wele no ferþere seye
Now thomas leue broþer lef thyn yre
Thu schalt me fynde as Iust as is a squre
Hold not þe deuyll knyf ay at þyn herte
Thyn angyr doth þe al to sore smerte
But schewe to me al thyn confescioun
Nay quod þe syke man by seynt symoun
I haue be schryue this day at myn curat  
I haue hym told al holy myn estat
  
Nedith it no more to speke of it seyth he
But ȝif me lyste of myn humylite
Ȝif me of ȝore gold to make oure cloystere
Quod he for manye a muskele and manye an oystere
Whan oþere men han ben ful weel at eyse
Hath ben oure fode oure Cloystere for to reyse
And ȝit god wot oneþe þe fondement
Parformed is ne of oure pauuement
Nis not a tyl ȝit withinne oure wonys
By god we owyn fourty pound for stonys
Now help tomays for hym þat harwede helle
Or ellis muste we oure bokys selle
And ȝif ȝow lakke oure predicacioun
Thanne goth þe world al to distruccioun
ffor ho so from þis world wolde vs bereue
So god me saue thomas be ȝoure leue
He wolde bereue out of þis world þe sunne
ffor who can teche and werke as we cunne
And þat is not of lytyme quod he
But sithe þat elye was or elyse
Han frerys ben þat fynde I of record
In charyte thankede be oure lord
Now Thomas help for seynte charyte
And doun anon he sette hym on his kne
This syke man wex ny wood for yre
He wolde þat þe frere hadde bee afyre
With his false dissymylacioun
Swych thyng as is in myn possessioun
Quod he may I ȝeuyn and non oþer
Ȝe sey me þis how þat I am ȝoure broþer
Ȝa certis quod þe frere trostyth wel
I tok oure dame oure lettere with oure sel
Now wel quod he and sumwhat schal I ȝeue
On to ȝoure holy couent whil I leue
And in þyn hand þou schalt it hald anon
On þis condicioun and oþere non
  
That þou departe it so my derere broþer  
That euery frere haue as meche as oþer
This schalt þou swere on þyn professioun
Withoute fraude or cauelacyoun
I swere it quod þe frere vpon myn feith
And þerwithal his hand in his he leith
Lo here myn feyth in me schal ben no lak
Now put þanne þyn hand doun by myn bak
Seyde þis man and grope wel byhynde
Benethe myn buttok þere schat þu fynde
A thyng þat I haue hid in pryuyte
A thoute þis frere þat schal gon with me
And doun his hand he lauchith to þe clyfte
In hope for to fynde þere a ȝifte
And whan þis syke man felte þis frere
Aboute his tewel grope þere and here
Amyd his hand he let þe frere a fart
There nys no capil drawynge in a cart
That myȝt a lete a fart of swych a soun
The frere vpstirte as doth a wood lyoun
A false cherl he seyde for godys bonys
This hast þou for dispit don for þe nonys
þow shalt abeye þis fart ȝif þat I may
His meyne þat herdyn þis afray
Come lepynge in and cachede out þe frere
And forth he goth with a ful angery chere
And fette hese felawe þere as hadde his stor
Ho lokede as it were a wylde boor
He grynt with his teth so was he wroth
A sturdy pas doun to þe court he goth
Where as þere wonede a man of greet honour
To whom þat he was alwey confessour
This worthi man was lord of þat village
This frere cam as he were in a rage
Where as þis lord sit etynge at his bord
Oneþe myȝte þe frere speke a word
  
Tyl at þe laste he seyde god ȝow se
This lord gan to loke and seyde benedicite
What frere Ihn what maner world is þis  
I se wel þat sumthyng þere is amys

Sit doun anon and telle vs what ȝoure gref is
And it schal ben amendyt If I may
I haue quod he had a dispit to day
God ȝilde ȝow adoun in ȝoure village
That in þis world nys non so poure a page
That he nulde haue abomynacioun
Of þat I hare resseyuyd in ȝoure toun
And ȝit me greuyth me no þyng so sore

And so par concequens to eche degre
Of holy cherche god amende it sone

Distemperyth ȝow not ȝe ben myn confessour

Madame by god I schal not lye
But I on oþer whise may ben wreke

This false blasfemour þat chargede me
To departe þat wele not departede be
What euery man Ilyche meche with myschaunce
The lord sat stylle as he were in a trance
And in his herte he rollede vp and doun
How hadde þis cherl þis ymaginacioun
To schewe þis probleme to a frere
Neuere erst er now herde I of swych matere

In arsmatryk coude þere no man fynde

Now ete ȝoure mete and lete þe cherl go pleye
Let hym gon hangyn him selue a deuele wey
Now stod þe lordys squyer at þe bord
That karf his mete and herde word be word
Of alle thynge whiche I haue ȝow sayd

To ȝow sere frere be so ȝe ben not wroth
How þat þis fart schulde euene delid be

Schal holde his nose vpryght vndyr þe naue
Thanne schal þis cherl with bely sterne and stout

And sette hym on þe whil ryȝt off þis carte
Vpon þe naue and make hym lete a farte
And ȝe schuln seen vp peryl of myn lyf
By pref which þat is demostratyf

And as þe nobele vsage ȝit of frerys is

With prechynge in þe pulpit þere he stod

As well as Ouyde or Ptholome

And hye witte made hym speke as he spak

And Iankyn hath wonne a newe gowne

As prouyd by hys wordes and his werk

I pray to god to sende his saul gode reste
Fraunceys petrak þe laureol poet

But for to tellen of þis worthi man

A prochem in þe whiche desernethe he

And spekethe of appenen þe hilles hie

And of Mounte resulus in special

Takith his first spryngynge and his sours
Where as he holte þe euen streight way his cours
To enel ward to Ferrar and to venyse
The whiche a longe þenge were to devise
And truly as to my Iugement

Saue he wolle conueye his matere  
But this is þe tale whiche þat ȝe shulle here
There ys at þe weste syde of Itayle
Doun at þe root of vesulus þe cold
A lusty playne habundaunt of vitayle
Where many a Toun þou mayste beholde
þat founded were in tyme of eldres old
And many an oþer delectable siȝt
And Saluce þis noble cuntre hiȝt
 A marquis whilom was in þat londe
As were his worþi eldres hym before
And obeisaunt and redy to his honde
Were alle his legees bothe lesse and more
Thus in delyte he lyued and hath done ȝore
Byloued and drad þurgh fauoure and fortune
Bothe of his lordes and of his comune
 þere with he was as to speke of lynage
þe gentelest yborne of alle lumbardy
A fayre person and stronge and yonge of age
And fulle of honour and curtesye
discrete ynouȝe his contrey for to guye
Saue in some thenges he was to blame
And Walter was þis yonge lordes name
 I blame hym þus þat he considerith nouȝt
In tyme comynge what myȝt betyde
But on his luste present was alle his þouȝt
And forto hauke and hunte on euery syde

And eke he ne wolde þat was worste of alle

But schortly þis  matyer for to chase
These are þe wordis  þat þe Markis sayde
To þis benynge  veray feyhful mayde

To al myn lust  and þat I frely may

And neuere ȝe  to groche it nyght ne day
And ek whan I seye ȝa  ne seye not nay
Neyther be word  ne frounnynge cuntenaunce
Swere þis  and here I swere oure allyaunce
Wonderynge vpon þis word quakynge for drede  
Sche seyde lord  vndyng and vnworthy

But as ȝe wele ȝoure self ryȝt so wele I
And here I swere  þat neuere wyllyngly
In werk ne thouȝt I nyl ȝow disobeye

Tis is Inogh Grysilde myn quod he
And forth he goth with a ful noble cheere
Out at þe dore and aftyr þat cam sche
And to þe puple he seyde in þis manere
  
This is myn wif  quod he þat standyth heere
Honoureth hire  and louyth hire I preye
Who so me louyth þere is no more to seye
And for þat nothyng  of hire olde gere
Sche schulde brynge into his hous he bad
That wemen schulde dispoylyn hire ryȝt þere
Of whiche þese  ladyis were not ryȝt glad
To handele hire clothis  wherIn sche was clad
But natheles þis mayde bryȝt of hewe
ffrom foot to heed they cloþede han al newe
Hyre heris han þey kembit that lay vntrussede
fful rudely and with here fyngerys smale
A coroun on hire heed þey han dressyd
And set hire ful of nouchis grete and smale
Of hire aray what schulde I make a tale
Oneþe þe puple hire knew for hire fayrnesse
Whan sche translatede was in swich rychesse
This Markis hath hire spousede with a ryng
Brouȝt for þe same cause and þanne hire sette
Vpon an hors snow whit and wel amblenge
And to his paleys he wolde no lengere lette
With Ioyful puple þat hire ledde and mette
Conueyede hire and þus þe day þey spende
In reuel tyl þe sonne gan descende
And shortely forth þis tale for to chace  
I seye þat to þis  newe Markysesse
God hath swych fauour sent hire of his grace
That it semede not bi liklynesse
That sche was born and fed in rewedenesse
As in a Cote  or in an oxsis stalle
But norchede in  an emperourys halle
  
To euery wight sche wexen is so dere
And worchepeful  þat folk þere sche was bore
And from hyre burthe knew hire ȝer be ȝere
Oneþe trowede þey but durste a swore
That to Ianykele of which I spak before
Sche doghtir were  for as be coniecture
Hem thouȝte sche was anoþer cryature
ffor thow þat euere  verteuous was sche
Sche was encresede in swych excellence
Of thewys goode  Iset in high bounte
And so discret and fayr of eloquense
So benyngne and so dygne of reuerence
And coude so þe puples herte embrace
That eche hire louede þat lokede in hire face
Not only of Saluces in þe toun
Publischid was þe bounte of hyre name
But ek besydyn in manye a regioun
ȝif ony seyde wel anoþer seyde þe same
So spradde of hire  high bounte þe fame
That men and wemen as wel ȝynge as olde
Com to saluce  vpon hire to beholde
This Water lowely nay but roially
Weddede with fortunat oneste
In godis pes leuyth  ful honestely
At hom  and outwar  grace Inogh haþ he
And for he saw þat vndyr low degre
Was ofte vertu hid  þe peple hym hilde
A prudent man  and þat is seyn ful seelde
Not only this Grisyldis thourgh hire wit  
Koude al þe fet of wyfly humbilnesse
But ek whan þe cas  requyrede it
The comune profyt coude sche redresse
  
There nas discord rancure ne heuynesse
In al þat lond þat sche ne coude apese
And wysely brynge hem in reste and ese
Thow þat hire husbonde  absent were anon
ȝif gentyl men or oþere of hire cuntre
Were wroth sche wolde  brynge hem at oon
So wyse and rype wordis hadde she
And Iugementis of so gret equite
þat sche from heuene sent as men wende
Puple to saue and oþere men tamende
Not longe tyme aftyr þat þis gresylde
Was Iweddit sche a doughtyr hath Ibore
Al hadde sche leuere a born a knaue chyld
Glad was þe markis and þe folk þerfore
ffor thow a mayde chyld cam al byfore
Sche may vnto a knauechild ateyne
By liklyhed syn sche nys nat bareyne
Ther fel as it bifel tymys mo
Whan þat þis child hath soukede but a throwe
This markis in his herte longith soo
To tempte his wyf hire sadnesse for to knowe
That he ne myȝte out of his herte throwe
This meruelious desyr his wyf tasayee
Nedles god wot he thouȝte hyre for taffraye
He hadde asayed hire ryȝt Inow before
And fond hire eeuere good  what neded it
Hire for to tempte alwey more and more
Thow sum men preyse it for a subtil wit
But as for me I seye þat yuele it sit
Tassaye a wyf  whan þat it is noon nede
And put hire in anguys and in drede
  
ffor which þis Markys  wrowt in þis manere  
He cam alone  a nyȝt þere as sche lay
With sterne face  and with ful sturdy chere
And seyd thus  Grisilde quod he þat day
That I ȝow tok  out of ȝoure pore aray
And put ȝow in estat of hegh noblesse
ȝe han not þat  forgetyn as I gesse
I sey Grisilde  this present dignete
In which þat I haue  put ȝow  as I trowe
Makyth ȝow nat  forȝetful for to be
þat I ȝow tok  in pore estaat ful lowe
ffor ony wele  ȝe motyn ȝoure seluyn knowe
Take heed of  euery word þat I ȝow seye
Ther is no wight  þat hereth it but we tweye
Ye woot youre self wel  how that ye cam heere
Into this hous  it is nat longe ago
And thow to me  þat ye been lef and deere
Vnto myn sentens ye been nothyng so
They seyn to hem  it is greet schame and wo
ffor to been subiect  and been in seruage
To the þat born art  of a smal village
And nameliche  sithe thyn doughtyr was bore
These wordis han  they spoke douteles
But I desire  as I haue doon byfore
To lyue myn lyf  with hem in reste and pees
I may nat in  this cas been rechelees
I mot doon with thyn  doghtyr for the beste
Nat as I wolde  but as myn peple leste
And ȝit god wot  it is ful looght to me
But natheles  withoutyn ȝoure wytynge
I wol not don  but this wol I quod he
That ȝe to me  assente as in this thyng
  
Schewe now ȝoure  pacience in ȝoure werkyng
That ȝe me hyȝte  and swore in ȝoure wyllage
That day that maked  was oure mariage
Whan sche hadde herd al this she noght ameued  
Neythir in word  ne chire nor cuntenaunce
ffor as it semede sche was nat agreuyd
Sche seyde lord al lyth in ȝore plesaunce
Myn chyld and I  with hertely obeysaunce
Been ȝourys al and ȝe mowe saue or spille
Youre owene thyng werkyth aftyr ȝoure wylle
There may no thyng god so myn soule saue
Lykyn ȝow þat may displesyn me
Ne I desyre nothyng for to haue
Ne drede for to lese saue only thee
Tis wil is in myn herte and ay schal bee
No lenthe of tyme or deth schal this defase
Ne change myn corage tyl anoþer place
Glad was this markis of this answeryng
But ȝit he feynede as it were nat so
Al drery was hise chir and hise lokynge
Whan þat he schulde out of the chambir goo
Sone aftyr this a furlong woy or too
He pryuyly hath told al his entente
Vnto a man and to his wif hym sente
A maner seriaunt was this priue man
The whiche that feihful ofte he foundyn hadde
In thyngis grete and ek swiche folk wel kan
Doon execucioun  in thyngis badde
The lord knew wel that he hym louede and dradde
And whan this sergeaunt  wiste this lordis wille
Into þe chaumbre  he stalke hym ful stylle
  
Madame he seyde ȝe mote forȝeue it me
Thow I do thyng to whiche I am constreynyd
Ye ben so wis that ful weel knewe ȝe
That lordis hestys mowe not been Ifeynyd
They moun been weel bewailyd and compleynyd
But men mot nede vntyl his lust obeye
And so wele I  þere is no more to seye
This child I am comaundit for to take  
And spek no more but out the child he hente
Dispitously and gan a chire make
As they he wolde a slayn it er he wente
Grysyldis muste  al suffere and al consente
And as a lomb sche sittyth meke and stylle
And leet this crewel seriaunt don his wille
Suspecious was  þe diffame of this man
Suspect his face  suspect his word also
Suspect the tyme  in which that this began
Allas hire doghtyr that sche louede so
Sche wende he wolde a slayn it ryght tho
But natheles sche neyther wept ne sikyd
Conformyng hire to that þe markis lykyd
But at the laste spekyn sche began
And mekely sche to the seriaunt preyde
So as he was a worthi gentil man
That sche muste kysse hire child er þat it deyede
And on hire barm this lytyl child sche leyde
With ful sad face and gan the child to blysse
And lullede it and aftyr gan it to kysse
And thus sche seyde in ful benyngne voys
ffare wel myn child I schal þe neuere se
But sythe I the haue markede with the croys
Of thilke fadyr blyssede mote he bee
  
That for vs deyede vpon a coroys of tree
Thyn soule lytyl chyld I the betake
ffor this nyȝt schat þou deye for myn sake
I trowe that to a norys in this cas
It hadde been hard  this routhe for to see
Weel myghte a modyr  þanne han cryede allas
But nathelas  sad  and stedefast was sche
That sche endurede  al aduercite
And to þe sergeaunt  mekelyche sayde
Haue here agayn  ȝoure ȝynge lite mayde
Seth now quod sche and doth myn lordis heste  
But on thyng wele I preye ȝow of ȝoure grace
That but myn lord forbad ȝow at the leste
Berieth this lite bodi in sum place
That bestis ne non oþere briddis it torace
But he no word wolde to þat purpos seye
But tok the child and wente vpon hise weye
This sergeant cam vnto his lord ageyn
And of grysildis wordis and hire chere
He told hym word in schort pleyn
And hym presentyth with his doughtyr dere
Sumwhat this lord hadde routhe in this manere
But natheles his purpos held he stylle
As lordys doon whan they welen han here wille
And bad this segeaunt þat he priuyly
Schulde this chyld softe wynde and wrappe
With alle cyrcumstauncis tenderely
And carye it in a cofere or in a lappe
But vp peyne of his hed of for to swappe
That no man schulde knowe of his entente
Ne whens he cam ne wheþer þat he wente
  
But at boloyne he to his sustyr deere
That thilke tyme of pavyk was cuntesse
He schulde it take and schewe hire this matyere
Bysekynge hire to don hyre bysynesse
This child to fostere in al gentillesse
And whos chyld þat it was he bad hire hyde
ffrom euery wyght for ought þat may betyde
This sergeaunt goth and hath fulfyld this thyng
But to the markis now rotorne we
ffor now goth he ful faste ymaginyng
ȝif by his wywis cheer he myghte se
Or by hire word aperceyue that sche
Were chaungede but he neuere hire coude fynde
But euere in on Ilyke sadde and kynde
As glad as humble as besy in seruyse  
And ek in loue as sche was wone to be
Was sche to hym in euery manere wyse
Nor of hire doughtyr nouȝt a word spak she
Non accident for noon aduersite
Was seyn in hire  ne neuere hire doughtiris name
Ne nemenede sche in ernest nor in game
In this estaat there passede been foure ȝeer
Er sche with childe was but as god wolde
A knaue child be this Waltyr
fful gracious and fayr for to beholde
And whan that folk it to his fadyr tolde
Not only he but al his court merye
Was for this child and god þey thankede and herye
Whan it was two ȝeer old and fro þe brest
Departede of his norysce on a day
This Markis caughte ȝet anothir best
  
To tempte his wyf ȝit oftere ȝif he may
O needeles was sche temptid in assay
But weddede men ne knowe no mesure
Whan that þey fynde a pacient creature
Wyf quod this Markys ȝe han herd er this
Myn peple beryth hevye oure maryage
And namely sithe myn sone Iborn is
Now is it werse than euere in al oure age
The murmur sleth myn herte and myn corage
ffor to mynne eris comyth the vois so smerte
That it wel nygh distroyed hath myn herte
Now sey they thus now Waltyr is agoon
Than schal the blood of Ianicle succede
And been oure lord  for oþere haue we non
Swich wordis seigh myn peple out of drede
Weel oughte I of swich murmour takyn heede
ffor certeynly I drede swich sentence
Thogh they not pleynly speke in myn audience
I wolde leue in pees ȝif that I myȝte  
Wherfore I am disposed vttyrly
As I his sistyr seruede be nyghte
Ryȝt so thynke I to serue hym priuyly
This warne I ȝow that ȝe nat sodeynly
Out of ȝoure self  for no woo schulde outraye
Beth pacient and þerof I ȝow praye
I haue quod sche seyd thus and euere schal
I wol nothyng  ne nyl nothyng certeyn
But as þou lyst not  greuyth me at al
Thow that myn doughtir and myn sone be slayn
At ȝoure comaundement it is to seyn
I haue not had no part of chyldere tweyne
But fyrst seknesse  and aftyr wo and peyne
  
Ye been oure lord doth with ȝoure owene thyng
Ryȝt as ȝow leste axseth no reed at me
ffor as I leffte at hom al myn clothynge
Whan I ferst cam to ȝow ryȝt so quod sche
Lefte I myn wil  and myn liberte 
And tok ȝoure clothyng wherfore I ȝow preye
Doth ȝoure plesaunce I wele ȝoure lust obeye
And sertis ȝif I hadde prescience
ȝoure wil to knowe er ȝe ȝoure lust me tolde
I wolde it don withoutyn necligence
But now I wot ȝoure lust and what ȝe wolde
Al ȝoure plesaunce ferme and stable I holde
ffor wiste I þat myn deth wolde don ȝoure ese
Ryȝt gladly wolde I deye ȝow to plese
Deth may not make non comparisoun
Vnto ȝoure loue and whan this Markys say
The constaunce  of his wyf he cast a doun
Hise eyen too  and wonderyth that sche may
In pacience  suffere al this aray
And forth he goth  with drery cuntenaunce
But to his herte it was  a ful gret plesaunce
This vgely sergeaunt in þe same wyse  
That he hire douȝtyr cauȝte ryȝte so he
Or werse ȝif men werse can deuyse
Hath hent hire sone that ful was of beute
And euery in on so pacient was sche
That sche no chere made of heuynesse
But kisse hire sone  and aftyr gan it blysse
Saue this sche preyede hym that ȝif he myȝte
Hire litille sone he wolde in erthe graue
Hise tendere lemys delitat to syȝte
ffrom foulys and from bestis hym to saue
  
But sche non answere myȝte haue
He wente his wey as hym nothyng rouȝte
But to bolonye he tenderly it brouȝte
This Markys wonderyth euere lengere the more
Vp on hire pacience and ȝif that he
Ne hadde sothli knowe ther byfore
That parfytly hire childeryn louede sche
He wolde a went  þat of subtilite
And of maleys or of crewel corage
That sche hath suffered  this with sad visage
But weel he knew þat next hym self certeyn
Sche louede hire childeryn best in euery wyse
But now of women wilde I axsyn fayn
If these assayis myghte not suffyse
What coude a sturdy husbonde more deuyse
To preue hire 1wyffehode1 and hire stedefastnesse
And he contynuynge euere in sturdynesse
But þere been folk of swich condycioun
That whan þey han a certeyn purpos take
They can not stynte of here entencioun
But ryȝt as they were boundyn to þat stake
They wil not of that  ferste purpos slake
Right so this ilke markis fullyche hath supposed
To tempte his wyf  as he was fyrst purposed
Here waytith  ȝif be word or cuntenaunce  
That sche to hym was chaungit of corage
But neuere coude he fynde varyaunce
Sche was ay on in herte and in visage
And ay þe ferthere þat sche was in age
The moore trewe ȝif þat it were possyble
Sche was to hym in loue and more penyble
  
ffor which it semede thus that of hem two
Nas but on wil for as Waltyr leste
The same lust was hyre plesaunce also
And god be thankede al fyl for the beste
Sche schewede wel for no wordely onreste
A wyf as of hire self nothyng ne schulde
Wille in effect  but as hire husbonde wolde
The sclaundere ofte and wyde spradde
That of a crewel herte  he wekkedely
ffor he a poore woman wedded hadde
Hath morderyd bothe hise childere priuyly
Swich mordere was among hem comounly
No wondyr is for to þe peplis ere
There cam no word  but þat þey morderede were
ffor wych ther as his puple ther by  fore
Hadde loued hym wel the slaundere of his diffame
Maade hem þat they hym hatid þerfore
To been a morderere is an hateful name
But natheles for ernest ne for game
He of his crewel purpos nolde stente
To tempte his wyf was set al his entente
Whan þat this doghtyr twelf ȝeer was of age
He to the court of rome in subtyl wyse
Enformede of his wil sente his massage
Comaundynge hem sweche bullys to deuyse
As to his crewel purpos may suffyse
How þat the pope as for the peplis reste
Bad hym to wedde anothir ȝif hym leste
I seye he bad thy schulde countrefete  
The popis bullis makynge mencioun
That he hath leue his fyrste wif to lete
And by the popis dispensacioun
  
And stynte rancure and dissencioun
Bytwixe þe puple and hym thus seyth þe bulle
The whiche they han pupliced at þe fulle
The rude peple as it no wondyr is
Wendyn ful wel that it hadde been ryȝt so
But whan these tydyngis cam to Grysildis
I deeme that hire herte was ful wo
But sche Ilike sad for euere mo
Disposede was this vmble cryature
Thaduersite  of fortune al tendure
Abydynge euere his lust and his plesaunce
To wom that sche was ȝeuyn herte and al
As to hire verray wordely suffysaunce
But schortely ȝif this story I tellyn schal
This Markys wrytyn hath in special
A lettere in wheche he schewith hys entente
And secrely he to boloyne it sente
To the erl of pauyk which þat hadde tho
Wedded his sistyr preyede he specially
To brynge hym hom ageyn his chyldere two
In honurable estat al opynly
But on thyng he hym preyede vtterely
That he to no wyght for no manere
Sholde not telle whos childre thy were
But seye the maydyn schulde Iweddid be
Vnto the markis of saluce anon
And as this erl was preyed so dede he
ffor at the day set he on his weye is goon
Toward saluce and lordis manyon
In ryche aray this made for to gyde
Hire ȝynge brothir rydynge by hire syde
  
Arayed was sche toward hire maryage  
This fresche mayde ful of gemmys cleere
Hire brothir which seuene ȝeer was of age
Arayede ek ful frosch in his manere
And thus in gret noblesse and with glad chere
Towar Saluces schapynge hire Iourneye
ffrom day to day they rydynge in here woye
Mong al this aftyr his wikkede vsage
This Markys ȝit his wif to tempte more
To the vttyreste priue of hire corage
ffully to han experience and lore
ȝif that sche were as stedefast as byfoore
He on a day in opyn audience
fful boystously hath seyd hire this sentence
Certis Grisilde I hadde Inow plesaunce
To han ȝow to myn wif for ȝoure goodnesse
As for ȝoure trouthe and for ȝoure obeisaunce
Not for ȝorere lynage  ne for ȝoure rychesse
But now knowe I in verray sothfastnesse
That in gret lordschepe If I wele auyse
Ther is gret seruytut in sundery wyse
I may nat do as euery plowman may
Myn puple me constreynyth for to take
Anoþer wyf and cryen day be day
And ek þe popis rancure for to slake
Consenteth it þat dar I vndyrtake
And trewely þus meche I ȝow seye
Myn newe wif is comynge by the weye
Be strong of herte and woyde anon hire place
And thilke dowere þat ȝe broughte me
Take it ageyn I graunte it of myn grace
  
Returnyth to ȝoure faderis hous quod he
No man may han alwey prosperite
With euene herte I rede ȝow to endure
The strok of fortune or of auenture
And sche answerde anoon in pacience  
Myn lord quod sche I wot and wyste alwey
How that bytwixe ȝoure magnificence
And myn pouerte no wyght can ne may
Makyn comparysoun it is no nay
I ne hylde me neuere dygne in no manere
To be ȝoure wyf no  ne ȝoure chaumberere
And in this hous there ȝe me lady made
The hyghe god take I for myn witnesse
And also wysely he myn soule so glade
I hyld me neuere lady ne maystresse
But vmble seruaunt to ȝoure worthynesse
And euere schal whil myn lyf may dure
Abovyn euery wordely creature
That ȝe so longe of ȝoure benyngnetee
Han holde me in honour and nobleye
Wher as I was not worthy for to bee
That thanke I god  and ȝow to whom I preye
ffor ȝilde it ȝow ther is no more to seye
And to myn fadyr gladly wele I wende
And with hym dwelle vnto myn lyuys ende
There I was fostered of a chyld ful smal
Tyl I be deed myn lyf there wele I leede
A wydewe clene in body herte and al
ffor sythe I ȝaf to ȝow myn maydynhede
And am ȝoure trewe wyf it is no drede
God schilde swich a lordis wyf to take
Anothir man to husbonde or to make
  
And of ȝoure newe wif god of his grace
So graunte ȝow wele and prosperitee
ffor I wele gladly ȝildyn hire myn place
In which þat I was blysful wone to be
ffor syth it lykyth ȝow myn lord quod sche
That whilhom were al myn hertis reste
That I schal gon I wele goon whan ȝow leste
But there as ȝe me profere swych dewarye  
As I fyrst brouȝte it is weel in myn mynde
It were mynne wrechede clothis no thyng fayre
The wheche to me were hard now for to fynde
O goode god how gentyl and how kynde
ȝe semedyn be ȝoure speche and ȝoure visage
The day that makyd was oure maryage
But soth is seyd  algate I fynde it trewe
ffor in effect it preuede is in me
Loue is not old  as whan þat it is newe
But sertis lord for noon aduercite
To deyen in þe cas it schal nat be
That euere in word  or werk I schal repente
That I ȝow ȝaf myn herte  with hol entente
Myn lord ȝe wot that In myn faderys place
ȝe dede me strype out of myn poore weede
And rychely me claddyn of ȝoure grace
To ȝow brouȝte I not ellis out of dreede
But feyth and meknesse and maydynhede
And heere ageyn myn clothynge I restore
And ek myn weddynge ryng for euere more
The remenaunt of ȝoure Iewellys redy bee
In with ȝoure chaumbere that dar I sayn
Nakyd out of myn faderys hous quod sche

Al ȝoure plesaunce I wele folwe fayn
But ȝit I hope it be not ȝoure entente
That I smokles out of ȝoure paleys wente
ȝe coude not don so disonest a thyng
That ilke wombe in whiche ȝoure chyldere leye
Schulde byfore the peple in myn walkynge
Be seyn al bare  therfore I ȝow preye
Lat me not lyk a werm  goon by the weye
Remembrith ȝow myn owene lord so deere
I was ȝoure wyf thow I onworthy weere
Wherfore in guerdoun of myn maydynhede  
Whiche that I brouȝte and not ageyn I bere
As vouche ȝe saf  to ȝeue me to myn meede
But swich a smok as I was wone to were
That I therwith may wrye þe wombe of hire
That was ȝoure wyf  and here I take myn leue
Of ȝow myn owene  lest that I ȝow greue
The smok quod he that thow hast on thyn bak
Lete it be stylle and bere it forth with the
But wel onethe thilke word he spak
But wente his wey for reuthe and for pite
Byforn hyre folk  hyre seluyn strepyth sche
And in hire smok with hed and feet al bare
Toward hire faderys hous  forth is sche fare
The folk hyre folwyn  wepynge 1in hire weye1
And fortune ay they curssyn as they goon
But sche from wepynge kepte hire eyen dreye
Ne in this tyme word ne spak sche noon
Hyre fadyr þat of this tydyng herde anon
Curseth the day  and tyme that nature
Schop hym to been a lyuys creature
  
ffor out of doute this olde poure man
Was euere in suspect of hire maryage
ffor euere he demede sythe that it began
That whan the lord fulfyld hadde his corage
Hym wolde thynke it were a disparage
To his estat so lowe for to alyghte
And woydyn hire  as sone as euere he myghte
Ageyn his doughtyr  hastyliche goth he
ffor he by noyse of folk  knew hire comyng
And with hire olde coote  as it myghte be
He cowerith hire  ful sorwefully wepynge
But on hire body  myghte it not brynge
ffor rude was the cloth  and sche more of age
By dayis fele  than at hire maryage
Tus with hire fadyr  for a certeyn space  
Dwellyth this flour of wyfly pacience
That neythir by hire wordys ne hire face
Byfore the folk ne ek in hire absence
Ne schewede sche þat hire was don offence
Ne of hire highe estat no remembraunce
Ne hadde sche as by hyre cuntenaunce
No wondyr is  for in hire greete estate
Hyre gost was ay in pleyn humylitee
No tendere mouth non herte delicate
No pompe no semblaunt of royaltee
But ful of pacient benygnetee
Dyscreet and prideles  ay honurable
And to hire husbonde euere mek and stable
Men speke of Iob  and most for his humblesse
As clerkis whan hem leste can wel endite
Namely of men  but as in sothfastnesse
Thow Clerkys preysyn wemen but a lyte
  
There Can no man in humblesse hem aquyte
As wemen 1can ne ben half so trewe1
As wemen ben but it be falle of newe
 ffrom Boloygne as this erl of pauyk come
Of which þe fame vp sprong bothe more and lesse
And to the peplis eris alle and some
Was kouth eek that a newe Markisesse
He with hym broghte in swich pompe and richesse
That neuere was there seyn with manys eye
So noble aray in al west Lumbardye
This Markis which that shoop and knew al this
Er þat this erl was come  sente his massage
ffor thilke sely pore 2Gresyldis2
And sche with 2houmble2 herte and glad visage
Noght in a swollyn thoght in hire corage
Cam at his heste  and on hire kneis hire sette
And reuerently and wisely  sche hym grette
Grisilde quod he  myn wil is outirly  
This mayde þat schal weddit been to me
Resseyuede ben to morwe as roially
As it possible is in myn hous to be
And ek that euery wiȝt in his degere
Haue his estat  in sittynge and seruyse
And hegh plesaunce  as I can best deuyse
I haue no wemen suffisaunt certeyn
The chambris for taraye in ordenaunce
Aftyr myn lust and þerfore wolde I fayn
That thyn were  al swich manere gouernaunce
Thow knowyst ek of old  al myn plesaunce
Thow thyn aray be badde and euele be seye
Do þou thyn deuer  at the leste weye
  
Nat only lord þat I am glad quod sche
To do ȝoure lust  but I desyre also
ȝow for to serue and plese in myn degre
Withoutyn feyntynge and schal euere mo
Ne neuere for no wele ne no wo
Ne schal myn gost withinne myn herte stente
To loue ȝow best  with al myn hol entente
And with that word sche gan the hous to dighte
And tabellis for to sette and al redy make
And peynede hire to don al þat sche myȝte
Preyinge þe chambereris for godis sake
To haste hem and faste swepe and shake
And sche þe moste  seruyable of alle
Hath euery chambre arayed and his halle
Aboutyn vndryn gan this erl alyȝte
That with hym broghte these noble childere tweye
ffor which the peple ran to seen the syght
Of hire aray so rychely be seye
And thanne at erst amongis hem they seye
That waltyr was no fol thow þat hym leste
To chonge his wyf  for it was for the beste
ffor sche is fayrere as they demyn alle  
As is Gresilde and more tendere of age
And fayrere freut betwen hem schulde falle
And more plesaunt for hire heye lenage
Hire brothir ek so fayr was of visage
That hem to sen þe peple hath caught plesaunce
Comendynge now þe Markys gouernaunce
O stormy puple  on sad and euere vntrewe
Ay vndiscret and chaungynge as a fane
Delytynge euere in rumbul þat is newe
ffor lyk the mone  ay waxe ȝe and wane
  
Ay ful of clappyng deere ynogh a Iane
ȝoure dom is fals  ȝoure constaunce euel preuyth
A ful greet fol is he þat on ȝow leuyth
Thus seydyn sadde folk in þat Cetee
Whan þat the peple gaȝede vp and doun
ffor they were glad rygh for þe noueltee
To haue a newe lady of hire toun
No more of this now make I mencioun
But to grysilde ageyn wil I me dresse
And telle hire constance and hire besynesse
fful bisy was Grisilde  in euery thyng
That to þe feste  was apertynent
Rygh nought was sche  abast of hire clothynge
Thow it were rude and sumdel ek torent
But with glad chier to þe ȝate is went
With oþere folk to greete the Markisesse
And aftyr doth  forth hire besinesse
With so glad chiere  hire gestis sche resseyuydh
And so benyngnely euerych in his degre
That no defaute no man aperseyuyth
But ay they wondere  what sche myghte be
That in so pore aray  was for to se
And coude swich honour  and reuerence
And worthily they preyse hire prudence
In al this meene while  sche ne stente  
That mayde and ek hire brothr to comende
With al hire herte in ful benyngne entente
So wel þat no man coude hire pris amende
But at þe laste  whan that þe lordys wende
To syttyn doun to mete he gan to calle
Grysilde as sche was bysy in the halle
  
Grysilde quod he as it were in his pley
How lykyth þe myn wif and hire beaute
Ryȝt wel quod sche myn lord  for in good fey
A fayrere saugh I neuere non þan sche
I preye to god  ȝeue ȝow prosperite
And so hope I þat he wele to ȝow sende
Plesaunce Inow vnto ȝoure lyuys ende
O thyng biseke I ȝow and warne also
That ȝe ne pryke  with no turmentynge
This newe mayde as ȝe han don mo
ffor sche is fosteryd in hire norychynge
More tenderely and to myn supposynge
Sche coude not aduercytee endure
As coude a pore fosterede creature
And whan this waltyr saugh hire pacience
Hire glad chere and non maleyce at al
And he so ofte hadde don hire offence
And sche ay sad and constaunt as a wal
Conteynynge euere  hire innocent ouyr al
This sturdy Markys gan his herte dresse
To rewe vpon hire  wifly stedefastnesse
That is Inogh Grisilde myn quod he

I haue thyn feyth and thyn benygnetee
As wel as euere weman was asayed
In gret estat and porely arayed
Now knowe I deere wif  thyn stedefastnesse
And hire in armys took  and gan hyre kesse
And sche for wondyr tok of it no kep

Sche ferde as sche hadde styrt out of hyre slep
Tyl sche out of hire masedenesse abreyde

Thow art myn wif  ne non oþer ne haue

This is thyn douȝtyr  which þow hast supposyd
To been myn wyf  þat oþer feithfully

Thow bar hym in thyn body trewely
At Boloyne haue I kept hem pryuyly
Take hem ageyn for now þow mayst nat seye
That þou hast lost non of thynne childeryn tweye
And folk that oþere weyis han seyd of mee

ffor no maleys  nor for no creueltee
But for tassaye in the thyn womanhede
And not for to sle mynne childeryn god forbeede
But for to kepe hem priuyly and stille

Whan this sche herde  aswounne doun sche fallyth

Graunt mercy lord  god thanke ȝow quod sche

And ȝoure benyngne fadyr tendyrly

Al sodeynly sche swapte adoun to grounde
And in hire swough so sadly holdyth sche
Hyre chylderyn two  whan sche gan hem tenbrace
That with gret sleyȝt  and gret difficultee

And euery wiȝt hire Ioye and feste makyth

That it was deynte for to sen the cheere
Bytwixe hem two now the ben met in feere
These ladyis whan that they here tyme sey
Han takyn hire and into chambere goon
And strippe hire out of hire rude aray
And in a cloth of gold that bryȝte schoon
With a coroun of manye a ryche stoon
Vpon hire heed they into halle hire brouȝte
And þere sche was honourede as hyre ouȝte
Thus hath this pitous day a blysful ende

Than was the reuel of hyre maryage

And richely his doghtyr maryede he

Of al ytayle and þanne in pees and reste
Hise wyuys fadyr in his court he kepith

In reste and pees aftyr his faderys day
And fortenat was ek in mariage
Al put he nat his wif in greet assay
This world is nat so strong It is no nay
As it hath been in olde tymys ȝoore
And herkenyth what this auctor seyth therfore
This stori is seyd noght for that wyuys schulde

But for that euery wight in his degree

Vnto a mortal man wel more vs oghte
Receyuyn al in gre þat god we see

But he ne temptyth no man that he boughte
As seith seynt Iame  If ye his pistyl reede

And sufferyth vs as for excercice
With scharpe schourgis  of aduercitee

Not for to knowe oure wil for certis he
Er we were born knew al oure freletee
And for oure beste is al his gouernaunce
Lat vs thanne lyue in verteuous sufferaunce
But on word lordynyis herkenyth er I go  
It were ful hard to fynde now on dayis
In al a toun Grysildis thre or two

The gold of hem han now so badde alayis
With bras that thogh the coyn be fayr at Iye
It wele rathere breste atwo than plye
ffor which heere for the wyuys loue of bathe
Whos lyf and al hyre secte god meynteene
In high maystrye and ellis were it skathe

Sey ȝow a song to glade ȝow I wene
And let vs stynte of ernestful matiere
Herkenyth myn song  þat seyth in this manere

And bothe at onoys buryed in Ytayle

O noble wyuys ful of prudence
Let noon humilite ȝoure tunge nayille
Ne lat no klerk haue cause nor dilygence
To wryte of ȝow a story of swych meruaile
As of Grisildis pacient and kynde

Ne sufferyth nat  þat men ȝow doon offence
And sklendere wyues feble as in batayle

In Ialusye I reede ek thow hym bynde
And thow schat make hym couche as doth a quayle
If thow be fayr  ther folk been in presence

To gete the frendys ay do thyn trauayle
Be ay of chir as lyght as lef on lynde
And lat hym care and wepe and wrynge and wayle
This worthi clerk whan endede was his tale
Oure ost seyde and swor by godys bonys

Myn wif at hom hadde herd this legende onys
This was a gentil tale for the nonys
As to myn purpos woste ȝe myn wille
But thyng that wil nat be lat it be stille

She wolde him ouer macche  I dar wel swere

There is a long  and a large difference
Betwix Grisildis  grete pacience
And of my wyf  the passyng cruelte

Assay who so wyl  and he shal fynde
That I seye soth  be seynt Thomas of Inde
As for the more part  I seye nat alle

A goode sire hoost  I haue Iwedded be
Theise Monthes two  and more nat parde
And ȝet I trowe  that he that al his lyue

Vnto the hert  ne coude in no manere

Coude tellen  of my wyues cursidnes
Now quod oure Host  Marchaunt so god ȝow blis

Gladly quod he  but of myn owen sore

A worþi knyȝt þat borne was at pavye
In whiche he lyued in grete prosperite
And sixty ȝere a wyfles man was he
And folowyd ay hys bodyly delyte
On womman þere as was hys appetyte
As don þese foules þat ben seculers
And whan þat he was paste sixty ȝeres
Were hit for holynesse or for doteage
I can not sey but suche a grete corage
hade þis knyȝt to be a weddid man
þat day and nyȝt he dothe all þat he can
To aspye where þat he wedded myȝt be
Praynge oure lorde to graunten hym þat he
Myȝt onys knowe þat blessefulle lyf
That ys bytwext an husbonde and his wyf
And for to leuen vnder þat holy bonde
With first god man to womman bande
Non other lyf seyde he ys worthe a bene
For wedlok ys so esy and so clene
That in this world it is a paradys  
Thus seyde this olde knyght þat was so wys
And serteynly as soth as god Is kyng
To take a wyf it is a glorious thyng
And nemely whan a man is old and hore
Thanne is a wyf the freut of his tresore
Thanne schulde he take a ȝong wyf and a fayr
On whiche he myȝte engendere and been eyr
  
And leede his lyf in ioye and in solace
Where as these bachelerys synge allas
Whan that they fynde ony aduercitee
In loue which is but childis vanytee
And trewely it is weel to been so
That bachelerys han ofte peyne and wo
On brothil ground they bylde  and brothelnesse
They fynde  whan they wene sekyrnesse
They lyue but as a bryd or as a beste
In lyberte and vndyr non areste
There as a weddede man in his estat
Leuyth a lyf blysful and ordenat
Vndyr the ȝok of maryage Ibounde
Wel may his herte in ioye and blisse aboūnde
ffor who can been so buxsum as a wif
Who is so trewe and ek so ententyf
To keepe hym syk and hol as is his make
ffor weel or wo sche wele hym not forsake
Sche is nat wery hym to loue and serue
Thogh þat he lye bedrede tyl he sterue
And ȝit some clerkys seyn it is nat so
Of which þe theofraste is on of tho
What fors thow Theofraste lyste to lye
Ne take no wyf quod he for husbonderye
As for to spare in houshold thyn dispence
A trewe seruaunt doth more diligence
Thyn good to kepe than tyn owene wyf
ffor sche wele cleyme half part al hire lyf
And ȝyf þou be sek so god me save
Thynne verray frendys or a trewe knave
Wele kepe þe bet  than sche that wayth ay  
Aftyr thyn good  and hath doon manye a day
And ȝif thow take a wyf on to thyn hold 
fful lyghtely mayst þou been a coukewold
This sentence  and manye an hunderede werse
Wryth this man  there god his bonys cursse
  
But takyth no kep of alle swich vanytee
Defye Theofraste and herke me
A wyf is godys ȝifte verrayly
Alle oþere manere ȝiftys hardyly
As londys rentys  pasture or comune
Or meoblys alle been ȝiftys of fortune
That passyn  as a schadewe vp on a wal
But dredles if pleynly speke I schal
A wyf wele laste and in thyn hous endure
Weel lengere than the lyste parauenture
Maryage is a ful gret sakrement
He which that hath no wyf I helde hym schent
He lyuyth helpeles and al desolat
I speke of folk in seculeer estat
And herke why I seye nat this for noght
That weman is for manys helpe Iwrought
The heye god whan he badde adam makyd
And say hym al alone bely nakyd 
God of his greete goodnesse seyde than
Lat vs now make an helpe vnto this man
Lyk to hym self and thanne he made hym Eue
Heere may ȝe se and here may ȝe preue
That wif is manys helpe and his confort
His paradys terestre  and his desport
So buxsum and so vertevous is sche
They muste nedis liue in vnite
On flesch they been and on blood as I gesse
Hath but oon herte  in wele and in destresse
A wif a seynte Marie benedicite
How myȝte a man han ony aduersite

The blysse that is betwixe hem tweye
Ther may non tunge telle nor herte thynke

Al that hire husbonde luste hire likyth weel

O blysful ordere of wedlok precious
Thow art so merye and ek so vertyuous
And so comendit and apreuyd ek

Vpon hise bare kneis oghte al his lyf
Thankyn his god that hym hath sent a wyf
Or ellys preye to god hym for to fynde
A wif to laste vnto his lyuys ende
ffor thanne his lyf is set in sekyrnesse
He may not ben disseyuyd as I gesse
So þat he werche aftyr his wyuys reed
Thanne may he baldely beryn vp his heed
They been so trewe and therwithal so wise
ffor which ȝif þou wilt werkyn as the wyse
Do alwey so as wemen wele þe reede
Lo how that Iacob as these clerkys rede
By good conseyl of his modyr Rebekke
Bond the kidis skyn aboutyn his nekke
ffor which his faderis benyson he wan
Lo Iudith as the story telle can
By good conseyl sche godys peple kepte
And slow hym Olefernus as he slepte
Lo Abigayl bi good conseyl how sche
Sauede hire husbonde  Naabal whan þat he
Schulde a be slayn and loke Ester also
By good conseyl deliuerede out of woo
The peple of god  and made hym Mardoche
To assure enhaunsede for to bee

Suffere thyn wyuys tunge as catoun bit
Sche schal comaunde and sche schal suffere it
And ȝit sche wele obeye of curteysye  
A wyf is kepere of thyn husbondrye
  
Weel may the syke man bewayle and wepe
There as þer is no wif the hous to kepe
I warne the ȝif wisely thow wilt werche
Loue wel thyn wif  as Cryst louede his cherche
If thow louyst thyn self thow louyst thyn wyf
No man hatyth his flesch but in his lyf
He fosteryth it and therfore bidde I the
Cheryche thyn wyf or thow schat neuere the
Husbonde or wyf  what so men Iape or pleye
Of wordely folk  holdyn þe sikere weye
They been so knyt there may non harm betyde
And namely vpon the wyuys syde
ffor which this Ianuarye of whiche I tolde
Considerede hath with hise dayis olde
The lusty lyf  the vertyvous quiete
That is in maryage hony swete
And for hise frendis on a day he sente
To tellyn hem teffect of his entente
 With face sad  his tale he hath hem told
He seyde frendis I am hor and old
And alwey god wot on myn pittis brynke
Vpon the soule sumwhat muste I thynke
I haue myn body folyly dispendit
Blyssede be god that it schal ben amendit
ffor I wele been certayn a weddede man
And that anoon  in al the haste I can
Vnto sum mayde fayr and tendere of age
I preye ȝow schapith for myn maryage
Al sodeynly for  I nyl nat abyde
And I wele fonde tespie on myn syde
To whom I may been weddit hastyly
But for as meche as ȝe been mo than I
Ȝe schul rathere swich a thyng espyen
Than I and wheere me best were to allyen
But on thyng werne I ȝow mynne freendis deere
I wele non old wyf han in no manere —
  
Sche schal not passe twenty ȝeer certayn  
Old fysch and ȝong flesch wolde I haue ful fayn
Bet is quod he a pyk than a pykerel
And bet than old bef is the tendere veel
I wil no weman  thretty ȝeer of age
It is but benestraw  and gret forage
And ek these olde wyuys god it wot
They cunne so meche craft on wadis boot
So meche broke harm whan hem leste
That with hem schulde I neuere lyue in reste
ffor sundery scolys make subtyl clerkys
Woman of manye scole half a clerk is
But serteynly a ȝong thyng may men gye
Ryght as men may warm wex with handis plye
Wherfore I sey ȝow pleynly in a clause
I wele noon old wyf han for this cause
ffor ȝif so were I hadde swich myschaunce
That I in hire ne coude haue no plesaunce
Thanne schulde  lede myn lyf in avouterye
And streyt to the deuyl whan I deye
Ne chyldere schulde I none vpon hire gete
Ȝit were me leuere houndis haddyn me etyn
Than that myn erytage schulde falle
In straunge hand and this I telle ȝow alle
I dote not I wot the cause why
Men schulde wedde and ferthere more wot I
There spekyth manye a man of mariage
That wot no more of it than wot myn page
ffor whiche causis men schulde take a wyf
Sith he ne may nat liue chast his lyf
Tak hym a wyf with gret deuocioun
By cause of leful procreacioun
Of childere too thonour of god aboue
And nat only  for paramour or loue
And for they schulde  lecherye eschue
And ȝilde here dette  whan þat it is dewe
  
Or for eche of hem  schulde helpyn oþer
In myschif  as a systyr  schal the brothir
And lyuyn in chastite ful holyly  
But siris bi ȝoure leue þat am not I
ffor god be thankyd I dar make avaunt
I fele myn lemys starke and suffisaunt
To do al that a man bihouyth to
I wot myn self best what I may do
Thow I be hor I fare as doth a tree
That blosmeth er than freut Iwexe bee
A blosmy tre is neythir dreye ne ded

 Dyuers men dyuersly hym tolde
Of mariage manye ensaumplis olde
Some blamede it some preysede it certeyn
But at the laste schortely for to seyn
As alday fallyth altercacioun

Of scole termys wisere men than thow

And with that word they rysyn sodeynly
And been assentid fully that he schulde
Been wedded whan hym leste and where he wolde

Manye fayr schap and manye fayr visage
There passede thorw his herte nyght be nyght
As who so take a myrour pulschede bryght
And sette it in a comoun market place
Thanne schulde he seen manye a figeur pace
By his myrour and in the same wyse
Gan Ianuarie in with his thought avyse
Of maydenys which that dwellyn hym by syde
He wiste nat where that he myghte abyde
ffor ȝif that on haue beute in his face
A nothir stant so in the puplis grace
ffor hire sadnesse and hire benyngnetee
That of the peple gretteste voys hadde sche
And some were ryche and haddyn badde name
But natheles bytwixe ernest and game
He at the laste apoyntyd hym on on
And leet alle oþere from his herte goon
  
And chese hire of his owene autoritee
ffor loue is blynd alday and may not see
And whan that he was in his bedde brought
He portreyede in his herte and in his thought
Hire frossche beute and hyre age tendere

Hym thouȝte eche othere manys wit so badde
That impossible it were to replye
Ageyn his choys that was his fantassie
Hise frendis sente he tho at his instaunce
And preyede hem to do hym that plesaunce
That hastely they wolde don hym come
He wolde abrege hire lordschepe alle en some
Nedyth namore for hym to goon ne ryde
He was apoyntid there he wolde abide

And aldyrferst he had hem alle a boone
That noone of hem  noone argumentis make

Which purpos was plesaunt to god seyde he
And verray ground of his prosperitee
He seyde there was a maydyn in the toun
Which that of beute hadde greet renoun
Al weere it so sche weere of smal degre
Suffiseth hym hire ȝouthe and hire beutee
Whiche mayde he seyde he wolde han to his wyf
To leede in ese and holynesse his lyf
And thankede god that he myȝte han hire al
That no wyȝt of his blysse partyn schal
And preyede hem to laboure in this nede
And schapen that he fayle nat to speede
  
ffor thanne he seyde his spiryght was at ese
Thanne is quod he no thyng may me displese
Saue on thyng prikyth in myn concience
The whiche I wele reherce in ȝoure presence
 I haue he seyde herd seyd  ful ȝore ago
There may no man haue parfit blyssis two
This is to seyne in erthe and ek in heuene
ffor thow he kepe hym from the synnys seuene
And ek from euery braunce of tylke tree
Ȝit is there so parfit felicite
And so greet ese and lust in maryage
That euere I am agast  now in myn age
That I schal leede now so merie a lyf  
So delicat withoute woo and stryf
That I schal han myn heuene in erthe here
ffor sythe that veray heuene is bouȝt so dere
With tribulacyounnys and greet penaunce
How schulde I thanne lyue in swich plesaunce
As alle weddede men doon with here wyuys
Come to the blis there Crist eterne on liue is
This is myn drede and ȝe myne brethere tweye
Assoylyth me this questioun I preye
 Iustinus whiche that hatith his folye
Answerde anoon ryȝt in his Iaperye
And for he wolde his longe tale abregge
He wolde non autorite alegge
But seyde sere so there be noon obstakele
Othir than this god of his heye mirakele
And of his mercy may so for ȝow werche
That er ȝe han ȝoure ryȝt of holy cherche
ȝe may repente of weddede manys lyf
In whiche ȝe se ther is no woo ne stryf
And ellis god forbeede but he sente
A weddede man hym grace to repente
Wel ofte rathere than a sengle man
And therfore syre the beste reed þat I can
  
Dispeyre ȝow not but hauyth in memorye
Perauntir sche may been ȝoure purgatorye
Sche may been goddis meene and goddys whippe
Thanne schal ȝoure soule vp to heuene skyppe
Swiftere than an arwe out of a bowe
I hope to god here aftyr ȝe schul knowe
That ther is non so greet felycite
In maryage ne neuere mor schal be
That ȝow schal lette of ȝoure saluacioun
So that ȝe vse as skil is and resoun
The lustis of ȝoure wyf attemprely
And that ȝe plese hire nat to amourously
And that ȝe kepe ȝow ek from othere synne
Myn tale is doon for myn wit is thenne
Byth not agast heereof myn brothir dere  
But let vs wadyn out of this mateere
The wyf of bathe ȝif ȝe han vndyrstonde
Of maryage which ȝe han on honde
Declarid hath ful wel in lytyl space
ffaryth now weel god haue ȝow in his grace
And with that word this Iustyne and his brothir
They take here leue and eche of hem of othir
ffor whan they sagh that it muste needis be
They wroughte so sly and wys tretee
That sche this mayde which þat Mayus hyghte
As hastyly as euere sche myghte
Schal weddede been on to this Ianuarye
I trowe it weere to longe now to tarye
Ȝif I ȝow tolde of euery scrit and bond
By which that sche was feffyd in his lond
Or for to herkene of hire ryche aray
But fynally is comyn the day
That to the cherche bothe be they went
ffor to resceyue the holy sacrement
fforth comyth the prest with stole about his nekke
And bad hire be lyk sarra and rebekke
  
In wisdam and in trouthe of maryage
And seyde his orysounnys as is vsage
And crouchith hem and bit god schulde hem blysse
And made al sikyr Inough with holynesse
Thus been they weddit with solempnetee
And at the laste sittyth he and sche
With othere worthi folk vp on the deys
Al ful of Ioye and blisse is the paleys
And ful of instrumentis and of vitayle
The moste deynteuous of al Itaylle
Byforn hem stood swich instrument of soun
That Orpheus nor Thebes Amphioun
Ne made neuere swich a melodye
At euery cours þan cam loud menstralsye
That neuere trumped Ieob for to heere
Ne Theodomas ȝit half so cleere
At Thebes whan the Citee was in doute  
Bacus the wyn hem shynketh alle aboute
And venus laugheth vpon euery wyght
ffor Ianuarye bycomyn was hire knyght
And wolde bothe asaye hise corage
In liberte and ek in maryage
And with hire fyr brond in hire hand aboute
Daunceth byfore the bryde and al the route
And certeynly I dare ryȝt wel sey this
Ymeneus  that god of weddyng is
Saw neuere his lyf  so merye a weddede man
Hold thow thyn pees  thow poete Marcian
That wrytist vs that ilke weddyng murye
Of hire Philologie  and hym mercurie
And of the song that the Musys sunge
To smal is bothe thi penne and ek thyn tunge
ffor to discryue of thyn maryage
Whan tender ȝouthe haue weddit stoupynge age
There is swych myrthe It may not been Iwretyn
Assayeth it ȝoure self thanne may ȝe wetyn
  
Ȝif that I lye or noon  in this matyre
Mayus that sit with  so benynge a cheere
Hire to byholde it semede fayrye
Queen Ester lokede neuere with swich an eye
On Assure  so meke a lok hath sche
I may ȝow nat deuyse al hure beutee
But thus meche of hire beute telle I may
That sche was lyk the bryȝte morwe of may
fful fyld of alle beute and of plesaunce
This Ianewarye is rauyst in a traunce
At euery tyme he lokede on hire face
But in his herte he gan hire manace
That he that nyght in armys wolde hire streyne
Hardere than euere parys dede Eleyne
But natheles ȝit hadde he greet pitee
That ilke nyȝt offendyn hire muste hee
And thouȝte allas o tendere creature
Now wolde god ȝe myȝte wel endure
Al myn corage it is so scharp and keene  
I am agast ȝe schul it not susteene
But god forbeede þat I dede al myn myȝt
Now wolde god that it were waxe nyght
And that the nyȝt  wolde lastyn euere mo
I wolde that al this peple were ago
And fynally he doth al his labour
As he best myghte  sauynge his honour
To haste hem from the meete in subtyl wyse
The tyme cam that resoun was to ryse
And aftyr that men daunce  and drynkyn faste
And spicis al aboute the hous they caste
And ful of ioye and blysse is euery man
Alle but a squier· hyte Damyan
The whiche carf byfore þe knyght manye a day
He was rauysschd on his lady May
That for the verray peyne he was nygh wood
Almost he schulde a swounnede as he stod
  
So soore hath venus hurt him with hire brond
As that sche bar daunsynge in hire hand
And to here bed they wentyn hastyly
Na moore at this tyme speke I
But theere I leete hym weepe Inogh and pleyne
Tyl frosche may wele rewyn on his peyne
O perylous fyr þat in the bed straw bredyth
O famulier fo that his seruise beedith
O seruaunt traitour false homeli hewe
Lyk to the neddere in bosum sly ontrewe
God schilde vs alle from ȝoure aqueyntaunce
O Ianuarie dronkyn in plesaunce
In mariage se how thyn damyan
Thyn owene squyer and thyn bore man
Entendyth for do the velanye
God graunte the thyn homely fo tespye
ffor in this world is wersse pestelence
Than homely foo alwey in thyn presence
 Parformede hath the sunne his ark dyurne
No lengere may the body of hym soiurne
On thorisonte  as in that latitude  
Nigh with his mental that is derk and rude
Gan ouersprede Themysperie aboute
ffor which departid is this blisful route
ffrom Ianuarie with stant on euery syde
Hoom tyl here housis hastily they ryde
Where as they don here thyngis as hem leste
And whan they saw here tyme goon to reste
Soone aftyr that this lusty Ianuarye
Wol go to bedde he wil no lengere tarye
He drynkith Ipocras clarre and vernage
Of spicis hoote tencresyn his corage
And manye a letuarie hadde he ful fyn
Swych as the cursede Monk daun Constantyn
Hath wretyn in his cursede bok de Coitu
To ete hem alle he was no thyng eschu
  
And to hise priue frendis thus seyde he
ffor godis loue as soone as it may bee
Let voydyn al this hous in curteys wyse
And they han doon ryȝt as they wole deuyse
Men drynkyn and the trauys drawe anon
The bryde was brough a bedde as stylle as ston
And whan the bed was was with the prest Iblyssid
Out of the chambere hath euery wygh hym dressid
And Ianuarye hath faste in armys take
His frosche May his paradys his make
He lullyth hire he kissith hire ful ofte
With thilke brustelis of his berd onsofte
Lyk to the skyn of houndfysch scharp as brere
ffor he was schaue al newe in his manere
He rubbith hire aboute hire tendere face
And seide thus allas I mote trespace
To ȝow myn spouse and ȝow gretly offende
Er tyme come that I schal doun dessende
But natheles consideryth this quod he
There wot no werkeman what so euere he be
That may bothe werke weel and hastely
This wil been don at leyser parfitly
It is no fors how longe that we pleye  
In trewe wedlok coupplit been we tweye
And blyssede be the ȝok that we been inne
ffor in  actis we mowe don no synne
A man may doon no synne with his wif
Ne hurte hym selue with his owene knyf
ffor we han leue to pleye vs bi the lawe
Thus labourith he tyl the day gan dawe
And thanne he takyth a soppe in fyn clarree
And vp ryȝt in his bed thanne sittyth hee
And aftyr that he song ful loude and clere
And kyste his wif and made wantoun cheere
He was al coltissh  ful of ragerye
And ful of Iargoun  as a flekkede pye
  
The slakke skyn aboute his nekke shakyth
Whil that he song so chuntyth he and crakyth
But god wot wat that May thouȝte in hire herte
Whan sche hym say vp syttyn in his scherte
In his nyght cappe and in his nekke lene
Sche preyseth nat his pleying worth a beene
Thanne seyde he thus myn reste wele I take
Now day is come I may no lengere waake
And doun he leyde his heed and slep tyl pryme
And aftyrward whan that he saugh his tyme
Vp ryseth Ianuarie but frosche may
Held hire chaumbere tyl the fourte day
As vsage is of wyuys for the beste
ffor euery labour sumtyme mote han reste
Or ellis longe may he not endure
This is to seyne no lyuys creature
Be it of fysch or bryd or beste or man
 Now wele I speke of woful Damian
That languysseþ for loue as ȝe schal heere
Therfore I speke to hym in this maneere
I seye O sely Damyan  allas
Answere to myn demaunde as in this cas
How schalt thow to thyn lady frosche May
Telle thyn wo  sche wele alwey seye nay
Ek ȝif thu speke sche wele thyn wo biwreye  
God be thyn helpe I can no betere seye
This syke Damyan in Venus fyr
So brennyth that he deyeth for desyr
ffor which he put his lyf in auenture
No lengere myghte he in this lyf endure
But pryuyly a pennere gan he borwe
And in a lettere wrot he al his sorwe
In maner of a compleynt or a lay
Vnto his fayre frosche lady May
And in a purs of silk he hyng on his scherte
He hath it put and leyd it at his herte
  
The mone that at noon was thilke day
That Ianuarie hath weddyd frosche May
In two of Taur was into Cancre glydyn
So longe hath Mayus in hire chaumbre abedyn
As custome is vnto these nobles alle
A bryde schal nat etyn in the halle
Til foure or thre dayis at the leste
Ipassede been thanne lat hire goon to feste
The fourte day compleet from noon to noon
Wha that the hie masse was Idoon
In halle sit this Ianuarye and May
As frosche as is the bryghte somerys day
And so bifel how that this goode man
Remembrede hym vpon Damyan
And seyde seyntemarye how may this be
That damyan entendith nat to me
Is he ay sik or how may it betyde
Hise squyeris that stodyn there by syde
Excusede hym by cause of his siknesse
Whiche lettede hyn to don his busynesse
Noon othir cause myȝt make hym to tarye
That me forthynkyth quod this Ianuarye
He is a gentil squyer by myn treuthe
ȝif that he deye it were harm and reuthe
He is as wys descreet and as secre
As ony man I wot of hys degre
And therto manly and ek seruysable  
And for to been a thrifty man ryȝt able
But aftyr mete as sone as euere I may
I wele myn self visite hym and eek May
To don hym al the confort þat I kan
And for that ilke word hym blyssede euery man
That of his bounte and his gentillesse
he wolde so confortyn in seknesse
his squyer for it was a gentyl dede
Dame quod this Ianuarye tak good heede
  
At aftyr mete ȝe with ȝore women alle
Whan ȝe han been in chaumbere out of this halle
That alle ȝe go to se this damyan
Doth hym disport he is a gentil man
And tellyth hym that I wele hym visite
Haue I no thyng but restede me a lyte
And speede ȝow faste for I wele abyde
Til that ȝe slepe faste by myn syde
And with that word he gan to hym to calle
A squyer that was marchale of his halle
And told hym serteyn wordis that he wolde
This frosche May hath streyt hire woye Iholde
With alle hire wemen on to Damyan
Doun by his beddis syde sit sche than
Confortynge hym as goodly as sche may
This damyan whan that his tyme he say
In secre wyse his purs and ek his bille
In which that he Iwrytyn hadde his wille
Hath put Into hire hand withoutyn moore
Saue þat he sikyth wondyr deepe and soore
And softely to hire thus seyde he
Mercy and that ȝe nat discouere me
ffor I am deed ȝif that this thyng be kyd
This purs hath sche  in with hire bosum hid
And wente hyre woy ȝe gete no more of me
But vnto Ianuarye Icomyn is sche
That on his beddis syde sat ful softe
And thakyth hire and kysseth hire ful ofte
And leyde hym doun to slepe and that anon  
Sche feynede hire as that sche muste goon
There as ȝe wot that euery man mot neede
And whan sche of that bille hath takyn heede
Sche rente it al to cloutis at the laste
And in the pryue softely it caste
 Who stodyeth now but fayre frosche May
Adoun by olde Ianuarye sche lay
  
That slepte tyl that the covhe hath hym awakyd
Anon he preyede hire to stryppe hire al nakyd
He wolde of hire he seyde han sum plesaunce
And seyde hire clothis dide hym encumbraunce
And sche obeyeth be hire lef or loth
But lest the precious folk be with me wroth
How that he wrouȝte I dar not to ȝow telle
Or whethir hire thoughte it paradys or helle
But heere I lete hem werke in hire wyse
Til euynsong rong and thanne they muste ryse
Were it by desteny or by auenture
Were it by influence or by nature
Or constellacioun  that in swich estat
The heuene stood  that tyme fortunat
ffor to putte a bille  forth of venus werkis
ffor alle thynge hath tyme  as sey these clerkys
To ony woman for to geete hire loue
I can not seye but greete god aboue
That knowith that noon act is causeles
He deeme of alle  for I wil holde myn pees
But soth is this how that this frossche May
Hath take swich emprescioun that day
Of pite of this ilke damyan
That from hire herte sche ne dryue can
This remembraunce for to doon hym ese
Sertayn thouȝte sche  whom that this thyng displese
I rekke not  for here I hym assure
To loue hym best of ony criature
Thow he namore  hadde than his scherte
Lo pete rennyth sone  in gentyl herte
Heere may ȝe se how excellent fraunchise  
In wemen is whan they hem weel avise
Sum tyraunt is as theere been manyon
That hath an herte as hard as is a ston
Which wolde a lat hym steruyn in the place
Wel rathere than grauntyn hym hire grace
  
And hem reioysyn in hire crewel pryde
And rekkyn nat to been An homytyde
This gentil May fulfyld of pitee
Ryȝt of hire owene hand makede sche
In which sche grauntyth hym hire werray grace
There lakkyth not but only day and space
Where that sche myȝte vnto his lust suffyse
ffor it schal been ryȝt as ȝe wele deuyse
And whan sche saugh hire tyme vpon a day
To visite þis Damyan goth May
And subtyly this lettere doun sche threste
Vndyr his pilwe rede it ȝif him leste
Sche takyth hym by the hand and harde hym twyste
So secrely that no man of it wyste
And bad hym been al hol  and forth sche wente
To Ianuarye whan that he for hire sente
 Vp ryseth Damyan the nexte morwe
Al passede was his siknesse and his sorwe
And kymbith hym and proynyth hym and pikyth
He dooth al that hym luste and lykyth
And ek to Ianuarye he goth as lowe
As euere dede a dogge for the bowe
He is so plesaunt on to euery man
ffor craft is al  ho so do it can
That euery wyȝt is fayn to don hym good
And fully in his ladyis grace he stood
Thus leete I Damyan aboute his neede
And in myn tale forth I wele procede
 Some clerkis seyn that felicitee
Stant in delyt  and therfore serteyn he
This noble Ianuarie with al his myȝt
In honeste wys as longith to a knyȝt
Schop hym to lyue ful delyciously  
His housynge his aray as honestely
To his degre was makyd as a kyng is
Amongis his othere honeste thyngis
  
He made a gardyn wallede al wyth stoon
So fayr a gardyn woot I nowher noon
ffor out of doute I verrayly suppose
That he that wrot the romauns of the rose
Ne coude of it the beute weel deuyse
Ne priapus ne myȝte nat suffyse
Thow he be god of gardynys for to telle
The beaute of the gardyn and the welle
That stood vndyr a laurer al wey grene
fful ofte tyme he pluto and his queene
Proserpen and al hire fayrye
Disportyn hem and makyn melodye
Aboute that welle and dauncedyn as men tolde
This noble knyght this Ianuarye the olde
Swich deynte hath  in it to walke and pleye
That he wele no wyȝt suffere to bere þe keye
But he hym self  for of the smale wiket
He bar alwey of syluyr a Clyket
Of which whan that hym lykith he it onschette
And whan he wolde paye his wyf hire dette
In somyr sesoun thidyr wolde he go
And May his wyf and no wyȝt but they two
And thyng that were nat doon a bedde
He in the gardyn parfornede hem and spedde
And in this wyse manye a merye day
Lyuede this Ianuarye and frossche May
But wordely ioye may non alwey dure
To Ianuarie ne to non creature
 O sodeyn hap o fortune onstable
Lyk to the scorpioun so deceyuable
That flateris wythyn hed whan þou wolt stynge
Thyn tayl is deeth thourgh thyn enuenymynge
O bretil Ioye o sweete venym queynte
O Monstre that so subtyly canst peynte
Tynne ȝiftys vndyr colour of stedefastnesse  
That thow disseuyst bothe moore and lesse
  
Whhy hast thow Ianuaris thus disseyuyd
That haddyst hym for thyn fulle frend resceyuyd
And now thow hast byraft hym bothe his Iyen
ffor sorwe of which desyryth he to deyen
Allas this noble Ianuarye free
Amydde his lust and his prosperitee
Is waxen blynd  and that al sodeynly
He wepith and he waylyth pitously
And therwithal the fyr of Ielusye
Lest that his wif schulde falle in sum folye
So brente his herte that he wolde fayn
That sum man bothe hym and hire hadde slayn
ffor neythir aftyr his deth ne his lyf
Ne wolde he that sche weere loue ne wyf
But euere lyue as widewe in clothis blake
Soul as the turtle that hat lost hire make
But at the laste aftyr a monyth or tweye
His sorwe gan aswage soth to seye
ffor whan he wiste  he may noon oþer bee
He paciently takyth his aduersite
Saue out of doute he may not forgoon
That he was Ielous eueremor in oon
Whiche Ielusye it was so outrageous
That neythir in halle ne in noon othir hous
Ne in non othir place neuere the mo
He nolde suffere hire neythir to ryde or go
But ȝif that he hadde hand on hire alwey
ffor which ful ofte wepith fresche May
That louyth Damyan so benygnely
That sche mot othir deye sodeynly
Or ellys sche mote han hym as hire leste
Sche wayth whan hire herte wolde breste
 Vpon that othir syde ek damyan
Bycomyn is the sorwefuleste man
That euere was for neythyr nyȝt ne day
Ne myȝte he speke a worde with frosche May
  
As to his purpos of no swich mateere  
But If that Ianuarie muste it heere
That hadde an hand vpon hire euere mo
But natheles by wrytyng too and froo
And priue sygnys wiste he what sche mente
And sche knew ek the fyn of his entente
O Ianuarye what myȝte it the avayle
Thow myȝtist se as fer as schepis sayle
ffor also good is blynd disseyuyd bee
As to be disseyuyd whan a man may see
Lo Argus which that hadde an hunderede eyen
ffor al that he coude poure or pryen
Ȝit was he blynd as god wot so been mo
That wenyn wisely that it be nat so
Passe ouyr is an ese I seye namoore
This frosche May that I spak of so ȝore
In warm wex hath enpryntit the klyket
That Ianuarye bar of that smale wiket
By which in to his gardyn ofte he wente
And Damyan that knew al his entente
The klyket countirfetid priuyly
There nys no more to seye but hastily
Sum wondyr bi this cliket schal bytyde
Which ȝe schul here ȝif ȝe wele on byde
O noble ouyde ful soth is seyd god wot
What sleyȝte is it thow it be longe and hoot
That he nyle it fynde out in sum manere
By Piramus and Tisbee  may men leere
Thow they were kept ful longe streyt ouyral
They been acordit rounynge thorw a wal
Ther no with koude a founde swich a slyghte
But now to purpos er than dayis eyghte
Were passed er the monyth of Iuil befel
That Ianuarie hath cauȝt so greet a wyl
Thour eggyng of his wif hym for to pleye
In his gardyn and no wight but thy tweye
  
That in a morwe vnto this May sente hee
Rys vp myn wyf myn loue myn lady free
The turtell voys is herd myn douwe sweete  
The wyntir is goon with hise reynys weete
Come forth with thynne eyne columbyn
Hou fayrere been thynne brestis than is wyn

Come forth myn leue spouse out of doute
Thow hast me wounded in myn herte o wyf
No spot of the ne knowe I al myn lyf
Come forth and lat vs takyn oure disport

Sweche olde lowede wordys vsede he

And in he sterte and that in swich manere
That no wyght myghte it wetyn nothir Ihere
And stylle he sit vndyr a busch anoon
This Ianuarie as blynd as is a ston
With Mayus in his hand no wyȝt mo
In to his frosche gardyn is go
And clapte to the weket sodeynly
Now wyf he seyde heere nys but thow and I
That art the creatour that I best loue
ffor by that lord that sit in heuene aboue
Leuere I hadde to deyin on a knyf
Than ȝow offendyn trewe deere wyf
ffor godys sake thynk how I the chees

But only for the loue I hadde to the
And thow that I be old and may not se
Beth to me trewe and I telle ȝow whi
Thre thyngis certis schul ȝe wynne þerby

And al myn eritage toun and tour

This schal been don to morwe er sunne reste
So wysely myn soule good brynge to blysse
I prey ȝow fyrst in couenaut ȝe me kysse
And thow that I be Ialous wite me noght  
Ȝe been so deepe enpryntid in myn thought
That whan that I considere ȝoure beute
And therwithal the onlikely elde of me

fforbeere to been out of ȝoure cumpaynye
ffor verray loue this is withoutyn doute
Now kys me wif and lat vs rome aboute
This frosche may whan sche these wordys herde
Benyngnely to Ianuarye answerde
But fyrst and forward sche began to wepe
I haue quod sche a soule for to kepe
As wel as ȝe and also my honour
And of myn wyfhod theilke tendir flour
Whiche that I haue assurede in ȝoure hond
Whan that the prest to ȝow the body bond
Wherfore I wele answere in this manere
By the leue of ȝow myn lord so deere
I preye to god that neuere dauwe þe day
That I ne sterve as foule as woman may
Ȝif euere I do on to myn kyn that schame
Oþer ellys I enpeyre so myn name
That I be fals  and if I do that lak
Do strepe me and putte me in a sak
And in the nexte ryuer do me drenche
I am a gentil woman and no wenche
Whi speke ȝe thus but men been euere vntrewe
And women haue repref of ȝow ay newe
ȝe can noon othir cuntenauns I leue ·
But speke to vs of onthrift and repreue
And with that word sche saw where Damyan
Sat in the busch and coghe sche began
  
And with hire fyngir signis made sche
That Damyan schulde clymbe vp on a tre
That chargede was with freut and vp he wente
ffor verrayly he knew al hire entente
And euery signe that sche coude make
Wel bet than Ianuarye hire owene make
ffor in a lettere sche hadde tolde hym al  
Of this matire how he werchin schal
And thus I leete hym sitte vp on the pyrye
And Ianuarye and May romynge merie
 Bryȝt was the day and blev the fyrmament
Phebus hath of gold hise stremys doun sent
To gladyn euery flour with his gladnesse
He was that tyme in gemynys as I gesse
But lytyl from his declinacioun 
Of Cancer Iouis exaltacioun
And so byfel that bryȝte morwe tyde
That in that gardyn · in the ferthere syde
Pluto that is kyng of fayrye
And manye a lady in his cumpainygnye
ffolwynge his wyf the queen Proserpyne
Eche aftyr othir right as ony lyne
Whil that sche gaderede flourys in the mede
In Claudian ȝe may the storijs rede
How in his gresely carte he hire sette
This kyng of fayrye thanne adoun hym sette
Vpon a benche of turuys frosche and greene
And ryght anon thus seyde he to his queene
 Myn wyf quod he there may no man sey nay
Thexperience so preuyth euery day
The tresoun  which that wemen doon to man
Ten hunderede thousent tellyn I can
Notable of ȝoure ontrouthe and brotilnesse
O salamon wys and rycheste of rychesse
fful fyld of sapience and of wordely glorye
fful worthi been thynne wordis to memorie
  
To euery witht that wit and resoun can
Thus preyseþ he ȝit the bounte of man
Amongis a thousent men ȝit fond I oon
But of wemen alle fond I noon
Thus seyde þe kyng þat knowith ȝoure wikkedenesse
And Ihesus filyus Syrac as I gesse
Ne spekyth of ȝou but selde reuerence
A wylde fyr and corupt pestylence
So falle vpon ȝoure bodyis ȝit tonyght  
Ne se ȝe nat this honurable knyght
By cause allas that he is blynd and old
His owene man schal make him Cokewold
Lo heere he sit the lecchour in the tree
Now wele I grauntyn of myn mageste
Onto this olde blynde worthi knyght
That he schal han aȝyn hie eyen sight
Whan that his wyf wolde don hym vilenye
Thanne schal he knowe al hire harloterye
Bothe in repref of hire and of othere mo
Ȝe shal  quod Proserpyne wol ȝe so
Now by myn moderys syris soule I swere
That I schal ȝeue hire sufficiaun answere
And alle women aftyr for hire sake
That thow they ben in ony gilt Itake
With face bold they schuln hem self excuse
And bere hem doun that wolde hem accuse
ffor lak of answere non of hem schal deye
Al hadde men seyn a thyng with bothe hise eyen
Ȝit schul we wemen visage it hardely
And weepe and swere and chyde subtyly
So þat ȝe men schul been as lewede as gees
What rekkith me of ȝoure autoriteis
I wot wel that this Iew this Salamon
ffond of vs wemen folis many on
But thow he ne fond no good woman
Ȝit hath there foundyn manye a nothir man
  
wemen ful trewe ful goode and verteuous

with martyrdom thy preuyn here constauce
The romayn geestis ek makyn remembraunce
Of manye a verray trewe wyf also
But sire be nat wroth  al be it so
Thow that he seye he fond no good woman
I prey ȝow takyth the sentense of the man
He mente thus that in souereyn bountee
Nis noon but god that sit in trynitee
 Ey for verray god that is but on  
What make ȝe so meche of salamon
What thow he made a temple godys hous
What thow he weere ryche and gloryous
So maade he ek a temple of false goddis
How myȝte he don a thyng that moore forbodyn is
Parde as fayre as ȝe his name enplaystre
He was a lechour and an ydolastere
And in his elde he verray god forsok
And ȝif god ne hadde as seyth the bood
Isparede for his faderis sake he schulde
Haue lost his regne rathere than he wolde
I sette ryght noght al al the vilanye
That ȝe of wemen wryte a Botyrflye
I am a woman nedis muste I speke
Or ellis swelle tyl myn herte breke
ffor sithyn he seyde we been Iangleressis
As euerre mote I brouke mynne tressis

To speke hym harm that wolde hym vilanye
Dame quod this pluto be no lengere wroth
I ȝeue it vp but sithe I swor myn oth
That I wolde graunte hym his syghte ageyn
Myn word schal stonde I werne ȝow certeyn

 Now lat vs turne ageyn to Ianuarye
That in the gardyn with his fayre May
Syngith ful muriere than the popyniay
Ȝow loue I best and schal and othir noon
So longe aboute the aleyis is he goon
Til he was comyn ageyn thilke pirie
Where as this Damyan sittyth ful merye
And hye among the frossche leuys grene
This frosche may that is so bryȝt and schene
Gan for to sike and seyde allas myn syde  
Now sire quod sche for ough that may betyde

Help for hire loue that is  of heuene queene

May han to freut so greet an apetyt
That sche may deyen but sche of it haue
Allas quod he that I ne hadde here a knaue
That coude clymbe allas allas quod he

But wolde ȝe vouche saf for godis sake
The pirie inwith ȝoure armys for to take

Thanne schulde I klymbe wel Inough quod sche
So I myn foot myȝte sette vpon ȝoure bak
Certys quod he theron schal been no lak
Myghte I ȝow helpyn with myn herte blod
He stoupede doun and on his bak sche stod
And caughte hire by a twyste and vp sche goth
Ladyis I preye ȝow þat ȝe been nat wroth
I can nat glose I am a rude man
And sodeynly anoon this Damyan
  
Gan pullyn vp the smok and in he throng
And whan that pluto saw this greete wrong
To Ianuarye he ȝaf ageyn his syght
And maade hym se as wel as euere he myght
And whan that he hadde cauȝt his siȝt ageyn
Ne was there neuere man of thyng so fayn
But on his wyf his thouȝt was euere mo
Vp to the tre he caste his eyen two
And saw that Damyan his wyf hadde dressed
In swich maner it may not been expressed
But ȝif I wolde speke vncurteysly
And vp he ȝaf a roryng and a cry
As doth the modyr whan the schild schal deye
Out help allas  harrow he gan to crye
O stronge lady stoore what dost thow  
And sche answerde sire what eylyth ȝow
Hauyth pacience and resoun in ȝoure mynde
I haue ȝow holpyn on bothe ȝoure eyen blynde
Vp peril of myn soule I schal not lyen
As me was tauȝt to hele with ȝoure eyen
Was no thyng bet to makyn ȝow to see
Than strogele with a man vp on a tree
God wot I dede it with ful good entente
Strogele quod he  ȝa algate in it wente
God ȝeue ȝow bothe on schamys deth to deyen

Allas quod sche that euere I was so kynde
Now dame quod he lat al passe out of mynde
Come doun myn lyf and If I haue myssayd
God helpe me so as I am euele apayid
But by myn fadyr soule I wende haue seyn
How that this Damyen hadde by the leyn
And that thyn smok hadde leyn vpon his brest
Ȝa sere quod sche ȝe may wene as ȝow lyst
But sere a man that wakyth out of slep
He may not sodeynly takyn kep
Vpon a thyng ne seen it parfytly
Til that he be adawed verrayly
Rygh so a man that longe hath blynd ybe
Ne may not sodeynly so weel Isee
ffyrst whan his syȝte is come newe ageyn
As he that hath a day or too Iseyn

þere may fulle many a siȝt you begyle
By ware I prey you for by heuen kynge
Fulle many a man weneth to see a thynge
And hit ys all an oþere þan hit semyth

And on hir wombe he strokethe hir fulle softe
And to hys palys home he hathe hir ladde
Nowe gode men I prey you to be glad
Thus endethe here my tale of Ianuarye
God blesse vs and his modir Seynt Mary Amen

Now swich a wif y preye god kepe me fro

Bi this marchauntis tale hit preueth wel

And cause whi it shulde reported be
And told to here of sume of this compaignie

Mi wille is good and lo my tale is this

There dwelt  a kynge þat weryd Russye
Thouȝe whiche þere dyede many a duȝty man
Thys noble kynge was clepyd Kambynskan
whiche in his tyme was of so grete rennoun
That þer was nouthir in regioun
So excellent a lord  in alle þinge
Hym lakkith nouȝt þat longith to a kynge
As of þe Cite whiche he was borne
he kepte hys lawe to whiche þat he was sworne
And þerto he was hardy wyse and ryche
And pitouse and Iuste alle wey yliche
Sothe of hys worde benygne and honorable
Of his corage as eney centre stable

Ȝon
As on
A fayr per
And kepte a

This noble kyng 
Hadde two sonys on 
Of whiche the eldeste 
That oþer sone was clepid 
A doughtyr hadde this worth
That ȝyngeste was and hyghte Canace
But for to telle ȝow al hire beautee
It lyth not in myn tunge nyn myn kunnyng
I dar nat vndyrtake so high a thyng
  
Myn engelysch is ek insufficient
It muste be a Rethor excellent
That coude hise colouris  longynge for that art
ȝif he schulde discryuyn euery part
I am non schich I mot speke as I can
And so byfil that this Cambynskan
Hath twenty wyntyr boryn his diademe
As he was wone ffrom ȝer to ȝeer I deme
He leet the feste of his natyuitee
Doon cryen thour Sarray his Citee

Phebus þe Sonne fulle Iolyf was and clere

In aries þe Coloryk þe hoot signe

Ayeyne þe swerde of wynter kene and Colde
This Kambynskan of whiche I haue you tolde
In riall vestement syt on hys deys
with a Dyademe full hiȝe in his paleys
And holte his feste sollempne and so riche
þat in þis worlde ne was þere none hit lyche
Of whiche yf I · shalle telle alle þe array
That wolde hit occupie a somers day
And eke hit nedyth not to devise
At euery cours þe ordre of hCambr MSfolio 277b

Vnto myn fyrste I wele han myn recours
And so befel that aftyr the thredde cours
Whil that this kyng sat thus in his nobleye
Herkenynge his mynstrall here thyngis pleye
Byforn hym at the bord deliciously
In at the halle dore al sodeynly
There cam a knyght vp on a stede of bras
And in his hand a brood myrour of glas
Vp on his thumbe he bar of gold a ryng
And by his syde a nakede swerd hangyng
And vp he ridyth to the heye bord  
In al the halle ne was there spokyn a word
ffor merueyle of this knyght to beholde
fful besily they wayte ȝynge and olde
This straunge knyȝt that cam thus sodeynly
Al armede saue his hed richely
Saluyth kyng and queen and lordis alle
By ordere as the setyn in the halle
With so heigh reuerence and obeysaunces
As weel in his speche as in hise cuntenaunces
That Gaweyn with his olde curteysye
Thow he weere comyn aȝen out of fayrye
Ne coude hym not amendyn  with a word
And aftyr thys byfore the heye bord
He wyth a manly voys seyth his message
Aftyr the forme vsed in hise age
Withoutyn vice of sillable or of lettere
And for his tale schulde seme the bettre
Acordaut to hise wordis was hise chere
As techith the art of speche hem that it lere
Al be that I can not soune his style
Ne can not clymbyn ouyr so hegh a style
ȝit seye i this as to comune entent
Thus meche amountyth al that euere he ment
  
ȝif it so be þat I haue it in mynde
He seyde þe kyng of arabye and of ynde
Myn lige lord on this solempne day
Salueth ȝow as he best can or may
And sendyth ȝow in honour of ȝoure feste
By me þat am al redy to ȝouere heste
This steede of bras that esyly and wel
Can in the space of a day naturel
This is to seyne in foure and twenty ourys
Where so ȝow liste in drouȝte or ellis schouris
Beryn ȝoure body into euery place
To whiche ȝoure herte willyth for to pace
Withoutyn wem of ȝow thour foul or fayr
Or ȝif ȝow leste to flien as hyghe in þe ayr
As doth an egele whan hym lyste to soore  
This same steede schal bere ȝow euere moore
Withoutyn harm tyl ȝe been there ȝow lesten
Thow that ȝe slepyn on his bak or restyn
And turne aȝen with wrythyng of a pyn
He that it wrouȝte it coude ful manye a gyn
He waytede ful manye a constelacioun
Er he hadde doon this operacioun
And knew ful manye a sel and manye a boond
 This myrour ek that I haue in myn hond
Hath swich a myȝt that men may in it se
Whan there schal falle ony aduercite
Vnto ȝoure regne  and to ȝoure self also
And opynly ho is ȝoure frend or foo
And ouyral this ȝif ony lady bryȝt
Hath set hire herte on ony maner wyȝt
ȝif he be fals sche schal his tresoun see
His newe loue and al his subtiletee
So opynly that ther schal nothyng hyde
Wherfore ageyn this lusty somerys tyde
This myrour and this ryng that ȝe may see
He hath sent onto myn lady Canacee
  
ȝoure excellent doughtyr that is here
Te vertu of the ryng ȝif ȝe wile heere
Is this that ȝif hire luste it for to weere
Vpon hyre thumbe or in hire purs it beere
There is no foul that flyeth vndyr the heuene
That sche ne schal weel vndyrstondyn his steuene
And knowe his menyng opynly and pleyn
And answere hym in his langage ageyn
And euery gres that growyth vp on roote
Sche schal ek knowe and whom it schal don boote
Alle be hise woundys neeuere so deepe and wyde
This nakede swerd that hangyth by myn syde
Wich wertew hath that what man þe smyte
Thouru out his armeur it wele byte
Were it as thikke as is a brauncheede ook
And what man is wounded with that strok
Schal neuere be hol tyl þat þou lest of grace  
To stroke hym with the plat  in þat place
Theere he is hurt this is as meche to seyn
ȝe moote with the plat swerd ageyn
Stryke hym on the wounde and it wele close
This a verray soth withoute glose
It faylyth not whil it is in ȝoure hoolld
And whan this knyȝt hat thus his tale told
He rydyth out of halle and doun he lytyth
His steede whiche þat schon as sunne brighte
Stant in the court stylle as ony stoon
This knyght is to hise chambere lad anoon
And is on arayed and to mete Iset
These presentis been ful ryally Ifet
This is to seyne the swyrd and the myrour
And born anon into the hye tour
with serteyn offycerys ordeynyd there fore
And on to Canacee this ryng was bore
Solempnely ther sche sit at þe table
But sikyrly withoutyn ony fable
  
The hors of bras that may not been remeuyd
It stant as it were to the ground Iglewyd
Ther may no man out of the place it dryue
ffor noon engyn of wyndas or palyue
And cause whi for they can not the craft
And therfore in the place they han it laft
Til that þe knyght hath taughte hem the manere
To voydyn hym as ȝe schal aftyr heere
 Gret was the pres that swarmyth to and fro
To gauryn on this hors that standyth so
ffor it so high was and so brod and long
So wel proporciounnyd for to been strong
Ryȝt as it were a stede of lumbardy
Therto so horsely and so quyk of Iye
As it a gentil poleys Courser were
ffor certis from his tayl vnto his eere
Nature ne art ne coude hym nat amende
In no degre as al the peple wende
But euere more here moste wondir was  
How that it coude goon and was of bras
And was as fayr as al the peple seemede
Dyuers folk dyuersly they demyd
As manye hedis as many wittis þere been
They murmuredyn as don a swarm of been
And madyn skill aftyr here fantasyis
Rehersynge of these olde poetryis
And seydyn it was lik the pegasee
The hors that hadde wyngis for to flee
Or ellis it was þe Grekis hors Synoun
That brouȝte Troye to distruccioun
As men in these olde gestis reede
Myn herte quod on is eueremor in drede
I trowe some men of armys been þerinne
That schapin hem this cete for to wynne
It were right good that alle thynge were knowe
A nothir rounede to his felawe lowe
  
And seyde he lyede it is rathere lik
An apparence mad by sum Magyk
As Iogelouris pleye at these 1festis greete1
Of sundery doutis thus they Iangele and trete
As lewede peple demyth comounly
Of thyngis that been mad more subtily
Than they can in here louwedenesse comprehende
They demyn gladly to the baddere ende
And some of hem wonderedyn on the myrour
That born was vp in the hyghe tour
How men myȝtyn in it sweche thyngis see
A noþer answerde and seyde it may wel be
Naturelly by compociciounnys
Of angles and of slygh reflecciouns
And seydyn þat in rome was swich on
They spoken of Alocen and Vituloun
And Aristotle þat wrytyn in here lyuys
Of queynte Mirouris and of prospectyuys
As knowyn they that han here bokys herd
And oþere folk han wonderede on the swerd
That wolde partyn thour out euery thyng  
And fille in speche of Tholophus þe kyng
And of achilles with his queynte speere
ffor he coude with it bothe hele and dere
Rygh in swich wise as men myȝte with the swerd
Of which ryȝt now ȝe han ȝoure selue herd
They spekyn of sundery hardyng of metal
And spoke of medycynys therwithal
And how and whanne it schulde Ihardit be
Whiche is vnknowe algate onto me
Tho speke they of Canaceis ryng
And seydyn alle of that swych a wondyr thyng
Of craft of ryngis herde they neuere noon
Saue that he moyses and kyng salomon
Hadde a name of rounnynge in swich art
Thus seyth the peple and drawyn hem a part
  
But natheles some seydyn that it was
Wondyr to makyn oof fern aschyn glas
And ȝit ne is glas lich aschyn of fern
But for they han knowyn it so fern
Therefore chesen hire Iangelyng and hire wondyr
As soore wonderyn some of on cause of ȝoundyr
On ebbe on flod on gossomyr and on myst
And alle thynge tyl that the cause is wist
Thus Iangele they and deeme and deuyse
Til that þe kyng gan from his bord aryse
Phebus hath left the angle meridional
And ȝit ascendyng was the beste royal
The gentyl lyoun with his aldryan
Whan that this tartre Cambynscan
Ros from his bord þere that he sat ful hye
Tofore hym goth the loude menstralcye
Tyl he cam to hise chambere of parementis
There as they sounyn dyuerse Instrumentis
That is lyk an heuene for to here
Now dauncyn lusty venus chylderyn deere
ffor in the fych hire lady sat ful hyghe
And lokyn on hem with a frendely Iye
This noble kyng is set vp in his trone  
This stronge knyght  is fet to hym ful sone
And on the daunce he goth with Canacee
Here is the reuel and the Iolyte
That is nat able a dul man to deuyse
He muste haue knowe loue and his seruyse
And been a festelyche man as May
That schulde ȝow deuyse swich aray
Who coude tellen ȝow the forme of dauncis
So vncouth and so frosche cuntenauncis
Swich subtyl  lokyngis and dissimulyngis
ffor drede of Ialuse mennys aperceyvyngis
No man but lancelot and he is deed
Therefore I passe ouyr al this lustyhed
  
I seye namore but in this iolynesse
I leete hem tyl men to the soper dresse
The styward bit spicis for to hye
And ek the wyn in al this melodye
The vsscheris and the squyeris been Igoon
The spicis and the wyn be comyn anoon
They ete and dynke and whan this hadde an ende
Vnto the temple as reson was they wende
The seruyse doun they soupyn al be day
What nedyth me reherce al here aray
Eche man wiste wel þat a kyngis feste
Hath plente to meste and ek to leste
And deynteis moo than been to myn knowyng
At aftyr sopir goth this noble kyng
To seen this hors of bras with al the route
Of lordis and of ladyis hym aboute
Swich wonderyng was on this hors of bras
That syn the greete sege of Troye was
Ne was there swich a wonderyng as was tho
There as men wonderedyn on an hors also
But finally this kyng askyth this knyght
The vertu of this courser and the myȝt
And preyede hym to telle his gouernaunce
This hors anon began to tryppe and daunce
Whan that this knyght leyde hand vpon his regne  
And seyde sire there nys no moore to seyne
But whan thu lyste to ryde any where
ȝe mote trylle a pyn stant in his eere
Whiche I schal ȝow telle betwyxe vs two
ȝe mote nemenyn hym to what place also
Or to wat cuntre þat thow lyste to ryde
And whan ȝe come there as ȝow leste abyde
Bydde hym discende and trylle a nothir pyn
ffor theere lyth theffect of al the gyn
And he wele doun descende and don ȝoure wille
And in that place he wele stonde stylle
  
Thow al the world the contrarye haddyn swore
He schal not thens been drawe ne bore
Or ȝif þou wit bidde hym thenys goon
Trille this pyn and he wele vanyche anoon
Out of the syȝte of euery maneere wyȝt
And come ageyn be it day or nyght
Whan that þou lystist to clepyn hym ageyn
In swich a gyse as I schal to ȝow seyn
Bitwixe ȝow and hym and that ful sone
Ride whan þou lyste there is no moore to doone
Enformede whan that kyng was of that knyght
And hath conseyuid in his wit a ryȝt
The manere and the forme of al this thyng
Thus glad and blythe this nobele kyng
Repeyrith to his reuel as byforyn
The brydyl is in to the tour Iboryn
And kept among hyse Iewelys leue and deere
The hors vanyschit I not in what maneere
Out of hire syȝte ȝe gete no more of me
But thus I lete in lust and iolyte
This Cambiscan hese lordis festenynge
Tyl wol nygh þe day began to sprynge
THe noryce of digestyoun the sleep
Gan on hem wynke and bad hem take kep
That muche drynk and labour wolde han reste
And with a galpynge mouth hem alle keste  
And seyde it was tyme to lye adoun
ffor blood was in his domynacioun
Cherisshet blod naturys frend quod he
They thankyn hym galpynge bi too by thre
And euery wyght gan drawyn hym to his reste
As slep hem hadde they take it for the beste
  
Here dremys schul not been told for me
fful weere here heedys of fumositee
That causeth drem of whiche þere is no charge
They slepyn tyl it was pryme large
The moste part but it were Canacee
Sche was ful mesurable as wemen bee
ffor of hire fadyr hadde sche takyn leue
To gon to reste sone aftyr it was eue
Hire lyste not appallid for to bee
Nor on the morwe onfestelyche for to se
And slepte hire fyrste sleep and thanne awok
ffor swich a slep sche in hire herte tok
Bothe of hyre queynte ryng and hire Mirour
That twenty tyme sche changede hire colour
And in hire sleep ryȝt for imprescioun
Of hire Mirour sche hadde a visioun
Where fore the sunne gan vp glyde
Sche clepede on hire maysteresse hire be syde
And seyde þat hire luste for to ryse
These olde wemen that been gladly wyse
As is hire Maysteresse answerede hire anon
And seyde madame wheþer wele ȝe goon
Thus erly for the folk been alle at reste
I wele quod sche aryse for me leste
No lengere for to slepe and walke aboūte
Hire Maystresse clepid wemen a greet route
And vp they ryse weel a ten or twelue
Vp rysyth frossche Canace hire selve
As rody as brygh as doth the ȝonge sunne
That in the Ram is foure degreis vpronne
Noon heyere was he  whan sche redy was  
And forth sche walkyth esyly a pas
Arayed aftyr the lusty sesoun soote
Lyȝtely for to pleye and walke on foote
Not but with fyue or sexe of hyre meyne
And in a trench forth in the park goth sche
  
The vapour which that from the erthe glod
Made the sunne to seme rody and brood
But natheles it was so fayr a syȝt
That it made alle here hertis for to lyȝt
That for the sesoun and the morwenynge
And for the foulys that sche herde synge

Of ȝoure deseese ȝif it lay in myn mygh

And erbis schal I ryȝt Inowe fynde

Than euere sche dede and fyl to grounde anoon
And lith a swounne ded lych a stoon

Vnto the tyme sche gan of swow awake
And aftyr that sche of hire swow abreyde
Rygh in hire haukys ledene thus sche seyde
That pete rennyth sone in gentyl herte

As weel by werk as by autorite

Of verray womanly benygnetee

But for noon hope for to fare the bet
But for to obeye vnto ȝoure herte free
And for to makyn oþere  be war by me
And bi the whelp chastysed is the lyoun
Rygh for that cause and for that conclusioun
Whil that I haue a leyser and a space

And vndyr hewe of trouthe in swych maneere
Vndyr plesaunce and vndyr bisy pyne
That I not cude a wend he coude feyne
So deepe in greyn he dyede his colourys
Ryȝt as a serpent hid hym vndyr flourys

Rygh so this god of loue this ypocryte

And kepyth in semblaunt alle hise4 cuntenauncys4
That sounnyn in to gentilesse of loue
As in a toumbe is al the fayrenesse aboue
And vndir is þe cors swich as ȝe woot
Swich was this ypocryte bothe cold and hoot
And in this wise he seruede his entent
That saue the feend non wiste what he ment
Til he so longe hadde wepid and compleyned
And manye a ȝeer his seruyse to me feynyd
Tyl that myn herte to pitous and to nyce
Al innocent of his crounede malyce

Vpon hise othis and hise seuretee
Grauntede hym loue vpon this condicioun
That euere more myn honour and renoun
Were sauyd bothe priue and apert
This is to seyne that aftyr his desert
I ȝaf hym al myn herte and al myn thought
God wot and he  þat oþerwyse noght
And tok his hert in chong of myn for ay
But soth is seyd goon sithe manye a day
  
A trewe wigh and a thef thynkyn nat oon
And whan he saugh the thyng so fer agoon
That I hadde grauntede fully myn looue  
In swich a gise as it was seyd aboue
And ȝeuyn hym myn trewe herte as fre
As he swoor he ȝaf his herte to me
Anon this tigre ful of doubilnesse
ffil on hise kneis with so deuout humblesse
With so high reuerence as bi hire cheere
So lyk a gentil louere of manere
So rauyschid as it semede for the Ioye
That neuere Troylis Ne parys of Troye

To louyn too as wrytyn folk byforn
Ne neuere syn the fyrste man was born
Ne coude man by twenty thousent part

Ne were worthi onbokele his galoche
There doubilnesse or feynynge schulde aproche
Ne so coude thanke a whit as he dede me
His manere was an heuene for to se
To ony weman were che neuere so wys
So peyntede he and kembede at poynt deuys
As weel hise wordis as hise contenaunce
And I louede hym for his obeysaunce
And for the trouthe I demede in his herte
That ȝif so were that ony thyng hym smerte
Al were it neuere so lyte and I it wiste
Me thouȝte I felte deth myn herte twyste
And schortely so fer forth this thyng went
That myn wil was his willis instrument
This is to seye myn wil obeyede his wil
In alle thynge as fer as resoun fil
Kepynge the boundis of myn worchepe euere
Ne neuere hadde I thyng so leef ne leuere
  
As hym god wot ne neuere schal no mo
This lastede lengere than a ȝeer or twe
That I supposede of hire not but good
But finally thus at the laste it stood
That fortune wolde that he muste twynne  
Out of that place which that he is inne
Where me was woo that is no questyoun
I can not make of it discripcioun
ffor on thyng dar I telle baldely
I knowe what is the peyne of deth therby
Swich harm I felte for he ne myȝte beleue
So on a day of me he tok his leue
So sorwefully ek that I wende verrayly
That he hade felt as meche harm as I
Whan that I herde hym speke and saw his hewe
But natheles I thoute he was so trewe
And ek that he repeyre schulde ageyn
Withinne a lytil while sotth to seyn
And resoun wolde ek that he moste go
ffor his honour as ofte it happith so
That I maade vertu of necescitee
And tok it weel syn that it muste bee
As I best myghte I hidde from hym myn sorwe
And tok hym by the hond seynt Iohn to borw
And seyde hym thus lo I am ȝourys al
Beth swich as I to ȝow haue been and schal
What he answerde it nedyth not reherce
Who can seye bet than he  ho can seye werse
Whan he hath al Iseyd thanne hath he don
Therefore byhouyth hire a ful long spon
That schulde ete with a feend thus haue I herd seye
So at the laste he mote forth his weye
And forth he flyeth til he cam there hym leste
Whan it cam hym to purpos for to reste

That alle thynge repeyrynge to hise kynde
  
Gladyth hym self thus seye men as I gesse

And strawe hyre cage  as softe as ony silk
And ȝeue hym sugere hony breed and Mylk

IN Armoryk that callyd is Britayne  
There was a knyȝt that louede and dede his payne
To serue a lady in his beste wyse
And manye a labour  manye a gret empryse
  
He for his lady wrouȝte er sche weere woune
ffor sche was on the fayreste vndyr sunne
And ek therto come of so hegh kynrede
That weel onethe durste this knyȝt for drede
Telle hire his woo his peyne and his distresse
But at the laste  sche for his worthynesse
And namely for his meke obeysaunce
Hath swich a pete cauȝt for his penaunce
That pruyuyly sche fel of his acord
To take hym for hire husbonde and for hire lord
Of swich lordschepe as men han of here wyuys
And for to leede þe more in blysse hire lyuys
Of his frewil he swoor hire as a knyȝt
That he neuere his lyue day ne nyȝt
Ne schulde vp on hym take maystrye
Ageyn hire wil ne kythe hire Ialusye
But hire obeye and folwe hire wil in al
As ony louere to his lady schal
Saue that the name of souereynte
That wele he haue for schame of his degre
Sche thankede hym with ful greet humblesse
And seyde sire seyth of ȝoure gentillesse
ȝe profere me to haue so greet a reyne
Ne wolde neuere god betwyn vs tweyne
As in myn gylt were other werre or stryf
Syre I wele be ȝoure humble trewe wyf
Haue here myn trouthe tyl myn herte breste
Thus been they in quyete and in reste
ffor o thyng syrys sauely dare I seye
That frendys eueryche oþer moote obeye
ȝif they wele longe holde cumpannye
Loue wele not been constreynede by maystrye
Whan maystrye comyth the god of loue anon
Bethith his wyngis and farewel he is goon
Loue is a thyng as ony spyryt free  
Wemen of kynde desire libertee
  
And not to been constreynd as a thral
And so don men ȝif I soth seyn schal
Loke ho so most is pacient in loue
He is at his auauntag al aboue
Pacience is an high vertu certeyn
ffor it venquyschith as these clerkis seyn
Thyngis þat rygour schulde neuere atteyne
ffor euery word men may not chide or pleyne
Lernyth to suffere or ellis so mote I goon
ȝe schul it lerne wheþer ȝe wele or non
 ffor in this world serteyn there no wyȝt is
That he ne doth or seyth sumtyme amys
Ire seeknesse or constelacioun
Wyn wo or chaungyng of complexioun
Causeth oftyn to don amys or spekyn
On euery wrong a man may not been wrekyn
Aftyr the tyme muste be thatemperaunce
To euery wyȝt that can on gouernaunce
And therfore hath this wyse worthi knyȝt
To leue in ese sufferaunce to hire hyȝt
And sche to hym ful wisely gan to swere
That there schulde neuere been defaute in hire
 Heere may men se an humble wys acord
Thus hath sche take hire seruaunt and hire lord
Seruaunt in loue and lord in maryage
Thanne was he bothe in lordschepe and seruage
Seruage nay but in lodschepe aboue
Sythe he hath bothe his lady and his loue
His lady certis and his wyf also
To whiche the lawe of loue acordyth þerto
And whan he was in this prosperitee
Hom with his wyf he goth to his cuntre
Nough fer fro pedmark þere his dwellynge was
Where as he lyuyth in blysse and in solas
Who coude telle but he hadde weddede bee
The Ioye  the ese  and the prosperite
  
That is betwyn an husbonde and his wyf  
A ȝeer and more lastyth this blysful lyf
Tyl that the knyȝt of whom I spak of thus
That of kayrrud was clepid Arueragus
Schoop hym to goon and dwelle a ȝeer or tweyne
In Ingelond that clepid was er Breteyne
To seeke in armys worschepe and honour
ffor al his lust he sette in swich labour
And dwelte there too ȝeer the bok seyth thus
Now wele I stynte of this Arueragus
And speke I wele of dorigious his wyf
That louyth hire husbonde as hire lyf
ffor hyse absence wepith sche and sykyth
As doon these noble wyuys whan hem lykyth
Sche  mornyth  wakyth  waylyth  fastith pleynyth
Desyr of hise presens so hire streynyth
That al this wyde world sche sette at nouȝt
Hire frendys whiche that knewe hyre heuy thouȝt
Confortyn 3here in al3 that euere they may
They preche hire they telle hire nyght and day
That causeles sche sleth hyre selue allas
And euery confort possible in this cas
They don to hire with al here besynesse
Al for to make hire leue hire heuynesse
By proces as ȝe knowyn euerichoon
Man may so longe grauyn in a stoon
Tyl sum fygure therin enpryntid be
So longe han they confortid tyl that sche
Resceyuede hath by hope and by resoun
Thenprentyng of hire consolacyoun
Thorw whiche  al hire sorwe gan swage
Sche may not al wey duryn in swych rage
And ek Arueragus in al this care
Hath sent hire lettere hom of his weelfare
And that he hastely wele come ageyn
Or ellis hadde this sorwe hire herte slayn
  
Here freendis saw hyre sorwe gan aslake
And preyede hire  on kneis for godis sake
To comyn and romyn heere in cumpanye  
Awey to dryue hire derke fantasye
And finally sche grauntede that requeste
ffor wel sche thouȝte it was for the beste
Now stood hire castel faste by the see
And oftyn with hire frendis walkede sche
Hire to disporte on this banke an high
Where that sche manye a schip and barge seigh
Seylynge here cours  where as hem leste goo
But thanne was that a parcel of hire woo
ffor to hire self ful ofte seyde sche
Is there no schip  of so manye as I se
Wil bryngyn hom myn lord thanne were myn herte
Al warychid of hire bittere peynys smerte
A nothir tyme there wolde sche sitte and thynke
And caste hire eyen  doun fro the brynke
But whan sche say  the gresely rokis blake
ffor verray feer  so wolde hyre herte quake
That on hire feet  sche myȝt hire not sustene
Thanne wolde sche sitte  adoun vp on the grene
And pitously  into the se byholde
And seye ryȝt thus  with sorweful sikys colde
Eterne god  that thour thyn puruyaunce
Ledist the world  be Iuste gouernaunce
In ydil as men seyn  ȝe nothyng make
But lord these grysely  feendly rokkis blake
That semyn rathere  a foul confusioun
Of werk than ony fayr creacioun
Of which  a parfyt  wys god and stable
Why han ȝe wrouȝt this werk onresonable
ffor bi this werk South North  West and Est
There is Ifostered no man  ne brid ne best
It doth no good  to myn wit but anoyith
Se ȝe nat lord how mankynde it distroyeth
  
An hunderede thousent  bodyis of mankynde
Han rolkis slayn  al ben they nat in mynde
Whiche mankynd is  so fayr a part of thyn werk
That þou it madist  lyk to thyn owene merk
Thanne semythit ȝe hadde a gret chiertee  
Toward mankynde but how thanne may it be
That ȝe sweche meenys make it to distroyen
Whiche menys doon no good but euere anoyen
I wot wel clerkys wele seye as hem leste
By argumentis that al is for the beste
Thow I ne can the causis not Iknowe
But that god  that made wynd to blowe
As keepe myn lord  this is myn conclusioun
To clerkis leete I al discripcioun
But wolde god that alle these rokkis blake
Were sunkyn into helle for his sake
These rokkis sleen myn herte for the fere
Thus seyde sche with manye a pitous teere
Hire fryndys saw that it was no disport
To romyn by the se but disconfort
And schopyn for to pleyen sum wher ellis
They leddyn hire by reueris and by wellis
And ek in othere places delectables
Thy dauncedyn the pleyedyn at ches and tablys
So on a day ryȝt in the morwetide
Vntyl a gardyn that was ther byside
In whiche they haddyn mad here ordenaunce
Of vitaylis and of othere puruyaunce
They goon and pleye hem al the longe day
And this was on the sexte morwe of may
Whiche may hadde peyntid with hise softe schourys
This gardyn ful of leuys and of flouris
And craft of manys hand so curiously
Arayed hadde this gardyn trewely
That neuere was thare gardy of swich a prys
But it hadde been the verray paradys
  
The odour of flourys and the frosche syght
Wolde han maad ony herte for to lyȝt
That euere was born but ȝif to gret seknesse
Or to greet sorwe hadde it in distresse
So ful it was of beute with plesaunce
At aftyr dyner gunne thei to daunce
And synge also saue dorygeen alone  
Whiche maade alwey hire compleynt and hyre mone
ffor sche ne saw hym on the daunce go
That was hire husbonde and hire loue also
But natheles sche mote a tyme  abyde
And wyth good hope lete hire here slyde
Vp on this daunce amongis oþere men
Daunsede a squier bifore Dorigen
That froschere was and Iolyere of aray
As to myn doon as is the monyth of may
He syngith daunseth passynge ony man
That is or was syn the world began
Therwith he was ȝif men schulde hym discryue
On of te beste farynge man on lyue

And weel belouyd and holdyn in greet prys
And schortely ȝif the sothe tellyn schal
Onwetyng of this Dorygen at al
This lusty squyer seruaun to venus
Whiche þat Iclepede was aurelius
Hadde louyd hire best of ony creature
Too ȝeer and more as was his auenture
But neuere durste he telle hire his greuance
Wythoute cuppe he drank al his penaunce
He was dispeyred nothyng durste he seye
Saue in his songis sumwhat wolde he wreye
His woo as in a gentyl compleynynge
He seyde he louede and was belouyd nothyng
Of swiche matiere made he manye layis
Songis compleyntis  roundelis virelayes
  
How he durste not his sorwe telle
But languscht as a furye doth in helle
And deye he muste he seyde as dede Ekko
ffor Narcisus that durste not telle his wo
In othere maner than ȝe here me seye
Ne durste he nat to hire his woo bewreye
Saue that parauenture sumtyme at daunces
There ȝonge folk kepyn here obseruaunces
It may wel be he lokede on hire face  
In swich a wyse as men that askyth grace
But no thyng wiste sche of his entente
Natheles it happid er they thens wente
By cause that he was hire neghebour
And was a man of worchepe and honour
And hadde Iknowyn hym of tyme ȝore
They fille in speche and they more and more
Vnto his purpos drow aurelius
And whan he saw his tyme he seyde thus
Madame quod he by god that this world maade
So that I wyste it myȝte ȝoure herte glade
I wolde þat day that ȝoure arueragus
Wente ouyr the se that I Aurelyus
Hadde went there neuere I schulde a comyn ageyn
ffor weel I woot myn seruyse is in veyn
My guerdoun is but brestynge of myn herte
Madame rewyth on mynne peynys smerte
ffor with a word ȝe may ne sle and saue
Heere at ȝoure feet god wolde that I were graue
I ne haue as now no leyser more to seye
Hauyth mercy swete or ellis ȝe do me deye
 Sche gan to lokyn vp on aurelius
Is this ȝoure wil quod sche and seye ȝe thus
Neuere erst quod sche ne wiste I what ȝe mente
But now Aurelius I knewe ȝoure entente
Bytwixe god that ȝaf me soule and lyf
Ne schal I neuere been vntrewe wyf
  
In word ne werk as fer as I haue wit
I wele been his to whom that I am knyt
Take this for fynal answere as of me
But aftyr in pleyn thus seyde sche
Aurele quod sche bi hye god aboue
Ȝit wolde I grauntyn ȝow to been ȝoure loue
Syn I se ȝow so pitously compleyne
Loke what day that endelyng Breteyne
Ȝe remoue alle the rolkis ston be ston
That they ne lette schyp ne boot to goon
I seye whan ȝe han mad the cost so clene  
Of rokkis that there ne is no stoon Iseene
Thanne wele I loue ȝow best of ony man
Haue here myn trouthe In al that euere I can
Is there noon othis grace quod he
No be that lord quod sche that makede me
ffor wel I wot that It schal neuere betyde
Lat sweche folyis out of ȝoure herte slyde
What deynte schulde a man han in his lyf
ffor to go loue anoþer manys wyf
That hath hire body whan so that hym lykyth
Aurelius ful ofte sore sykyth
Wo was aurelius whan that he this herde
And with a sorweful herte he thus answerde
Madame quod he this were an Impossible
Thanne mote I deye on sodeyn deth horrible
And with that word he turnede hym anon
Tho come here othere frendis manyon
And in the aleyijs they romede vp and doun
And no thyng wiste of this conclusioun
But sodeynly begunne reuel newe
Til that the bryȝte sunne loste his hewe
ffor thorisonte refte þe sunne his lyȝt
This is as meche to seye as it was nyȝt
And hom they goon In Ioye and in solas
Saue only wreche Aurelius allas
  
He to his hous is goon with sorweful herte
He seth he may not from his deth asterte
Hym somede that he felte his herte colde
Vp to the heuene hise hondis he gan holde
And on hise kneis bare he sette hym doun
And in his rauynge seyde his orysoun
ffor verray woo out of his wit he broyde
He nyste what he spak but thus he seyde
With pitous herte his pleynt hath he bygunne
Vnto the goddis and fyrst vp to the sunne
 He seyde Appollo god and gouernour
Of euery plaunte herbe tre and flour
That ȝeuyst aftyr thi declinacioun  
To eche of hem his tyme and his sesoun
As thyn herberwe chaungith lowe and hyghe
Lord phebus cast thyn merciable Iye
On wrechede auryele wheche that am but lorn
Lo lord myn lady hath myn deth Isworn
Withoutyn gilt but thyn benyngnete
Vpon myn dedly herte haue sum petee
ffor wel I wot lord phebus If thow lest
ȝe may me helpe saue myn lady best
Now vouchith saf that I may ȝow deuyse
How that I may been holpe and in what wyse
 Ȝoure blysful systyr luciane the schene
That of the see is cheef goddesse and queene
Thow neptinius haue deyte on the see

ȝe knowyn weel lord that ryȝt as hire desyr
is to been quykyd and lyghtenyd of ȝoure fyer
ffor whiche sche folwyth ȝow ful busyly
Ryȝt so the see desyryth naturelly
To folwyn hire as sche that is goddesse
Bothe in the se and ryuerys more and lesse
Therfore lord phebus this is myn request
Do this myrakele or do myn herte brest
  
That now next at this opposicioun
Which in the sygne schal be of the lyoun
As preyeth hire so greet a flood to brynge
That fyue fademe at the leste it ouyr sprynge
The hyeste rok in armorik briteyne
And lat this flod endure ȝerys tweyne
Thanne sertys to myn lady may I seye
Holdyth ȝoure heste the rokkis been awey
Lord phebus doth this myrakele for me
Preyeth hyr sche go no fastere cours than ȝe
I seye preye ȝoure systyr that sche goo
Non fastere course  these ȝerys two
Thanne schal sche been at the fulle alwey
And spryng flood laste bothe nyght and day
And but she wouchesaf in swich maneere  
To graunte me myn souereyn lady deere
Preye hire to synke euery rokke adoovn
In to hire owene derke regioun
Vndyr the ground there pluto dwellyth Inne
Or neuere more schal I myn lady wynne
Thy temple in delphos wil I barfoot seke
Lord phebus se the teris on myn cheke
And of myn peyne haue compassioun
And with word for sorwe he fel adoun

2And long tyme he lay  forth in a traunce2
His brothir which that knew of his penaunce
Vp cauȝte hym  and to bedde hath hym brouȝt
Dispeyrede in this turnement and this thoght
Lete I this woful creature lye
Chese he for me  where he wele leue or dye
 Arueragus  with heye and gret honour
As he that was of chyualrye the flour
Is comyn hom and othere worthy men
O blysful art tow now thow Dorigeoun
That hast thyn lusty husbonde in thyne armys
The frosche knyȝt the worthi man of armys
  
That louyt the as his owene hertis lyf
Nothing luste hym to be ymaginatyf
ȝif ony wight hadde spoke whil he was oute
To hire of loue he hadde of it no doute
He not entendyth to no swich matere
But dauncith Iustyth makyth hire good chere
And thus in Ioye and blysse I leete hem dwelle
And of the sike Aurelyus I wele ȝow telle
 In langure and in turnemen furyus
Two ȝeer and moore lay wreche aurelyus
Er ony foote he myȝte on erthe goon
Ne confort in this tyme ne hadde he noon
Saue of his brothir which that was a clerk
He knew of al this wo and al this werk
ffor to noon othir creature certeyn
Of this matere he durste no word seyn
Vndyr his brest he bar it sore  
And so fer forth it greuede hym the moore
Than euere dede Pamplius or Galatheene
His brest was sor withoutyn for to sene
But in his herte ay was the arwe kene
And weel ȝe knowe that of a sursanure
In surgerye is parlious the cure
But men myȝte tuche the arwe or come therby
His brothir wep and waylede pryuyly
Til at the laste hym fil in remembraunce
That whil he was at orlionys in fraunce
As ȝonge clerkis that been likerous
To rendyn artis that been curious
Sekin in eueri halk and euery herne
Particuler sciencis for to lerne
He hym remembrede that vpon a day
At orlionys in stodie he say
Of magyk naturel whiche that his felawe
That was that tyme a bacheler of lawe
Al were he there to lerne a nothir craft
Hadde priuyly vp on his deske laft
  
Touchynge the eyghte and twenty manciounnys
That longyn to the moone and swich folye
Swich book that spak meche of the operaciounnys

ffor holycherchis feyth in oure beleue
Ne suffere noone illusiounnys vs to greue
And whan this bok was in remembraunce
Anoon for ioye his herte gan to daunce
And to hym self he seyde pryuyly
Myn brother schal been warshit hastily
ffor I am sekyr that theere ben sciencis
By whiche men mak diuers apparencis
Sweche as these subtyle tregettourys pleye
ffor ofte at festis  haue I weel herd seye
That tregettouris withinne an halle large
Haue mad come in a watyr and a barge
And in the halle rowyn vp and doun
Sumtyme haue semyd to come a grym lyoun
And sumtyme flouris sprynge as in a mede  
Sumtyme a vine and grapis white and reede
Sumtyme a castel al of lym and stoon
And whan hym lykith woydede it anoon
Thus semede it to euery manys syȝt
Now thanne conclude I thus as ȝif I myght
At orlyonys sum old felaue I fynde
That hadde these monys manciounnys in mynde
Or othere Magyk naturel aboue
He schulde weel make myn brothir han his love
ffor with apparens a clerk may make
To mannys syȝt that alle the rokkis blake
Of Brytaygne were voydede euerychon
And schippis by the brynke comyn and goon
And in swich forme endure a day or two
Thanne were myn brothir warsched of his woo
Thanne muste sche nedys holdyn hyre byheste
Or ellis he schal schame hire at the leste
  
What schulde I make a lengere tale of this
Vnto hise brotheris bed he comyn is
And swich confort he ȝaf hym for to goon
To Orlyonys that he vp styrte anoon
And in his weye forward is he fare
In hope for to been lessede of his care
Whan they were come  almost to that cete
But ȝif it were a two furlong or thre
A ȝong clerk romynge by hym self he mette
Whiche that in latyn thrystily hym grette
And aftyr that he seyde a wondyr thyng
I knowe quod he the cause of ȝoure comyng
And er they ferthere ony foote wente
He told hem al that was in here entente
This Britoun Clerk hym askede of felawys
The whiche hem had knowe of olde dawis
And he answerde hem that they dede were
ffor which he wepte ful ofte manye a teere
Doun of his hors Aurelyus lyȝte anon
And with this Magicien forth is he gon
Hom to his hous and maade hem wel at eese  
Hem lakkede no vitayle that myghte hem pleese
So weel arayede hous as there was oon
Aurelyus in his lyf saw neuere noon
He shewede hym er he wente to soper
fforestis  parkis ful of wylde deer
There saugh he hertis with here hornys hye
The gretteste that euere were seyn with Iye
He saw of hem an hunderede weere slayn with houndis
And some with arwis bledde of bittere wondys
He say whan woyded were the wylde deer
The faucounneris vpon a fayr reuer
That with here haukys han the heyroun slayn
Tho saugh he knyȝtis slayn in a playn
And aftyr this he dede hym swich plesaunce
That he hym schewede his lady on a dauce
  
On whiche hym selue daunsede as hym thouȝte
And whanne this Maystyr that this Magik wrouȝt
Saw it was tyme he clapte hise handis two
And farweel al oure reuel was a go
And remoūuede they neuere out of the hous
Whil they seye al the syght meruelious
But in hise stodie there as hise bokys be
They seetyn stille and no whit but they thre
To hym his maystir callede his squyer
And seyde thus is redy oure soper
Almost an hour it is I vndyrtake
Sythe I ȝow bad oure soper for to make
Whan that these worthi men wentyn with me
Into myne stodye there as mynne bokis be
Syre quod this squyer whan that it lykyth ȝow
It is al redy thow ȝe wele rygh now
Go we thanne suppe as for the beste
These amerouse folk sumtyme mote han reste
At aftyr soper felle they in tretee
What summe schulde this maysteris gerdoun bee
To remeuyn alle the rokkis of bretayne
And ek from Gerounde to the mount of Sayne
He made it straung and swor so god hym saue  
Lasse than a thousent pound wolde he nat haue
Ne gladli for that summe wolde he nat goon
Aurelyus with blysful herte anoon
Answerde thus fy on a thousent pound
This wide world which that men seyn is round
I wolde it ȝeue ȝif I weere lord of it
This bargayn is ful drewyn for we been knyt
Ȝe schal been payed trewely be myn trouthe
But lokyth now for no necligence ne slouthe
Ȝe tarye vs no lengere than to morwe
Nay quod this clerk  here myn feyth to borwe
To bedde is goon Aurelius whan hym leste
And wel nygh al that nyght he hadde his reste
  
What for his labour and his hope of blys
His woful herte of penaunce hadde a lys
Vp on the morwe whan that it was day
To bryteyne toke they the ryȝte way
Aurelyus and the Magicyoun by syde
And been descendit there they wele vnbyde
And this was as the bokys me remembre
The colde frosty sesoun of decembre
Phebus wex old and hewid lyk latoun
That in his hoote declynacioun
Schon as the burnet gold with streemys bryȝte
But now in Caprycorn adoun he lyghte
Wheere as he schon ful pale I dar weel seyn
The bittere frostis with the sleet and reyn
Distroyed hat the grene and euery ȝerd
Ianus sit by the fyr with double berd
And drynkyth of hyse bugle horn the wyn
Byforn hym stant braun  of the tuskyd swyn
An Nowel syngyth  eueuery lusty man
Aurelius in al that euere he can
Doth to his maystyr chier and reuerence
And preyeth hym to don his dilygence
To bryngyn hym out of hise peynys smerte
Or with a swerd that he wolde slytte his herte
This subtyl clerk swych routhe hadde of this man  
That nygh and day he spedde hym as he kan
To waytyn a tyme of his conclusioun
That is to seyne to makyn illusioun
By swich an apparens or iogilrye
I ne can no termys of astrologie
That sche and euery wygh schulde wene and seye
That of Brytayne the rokkys were aweye
Or ellys they were sunkyn vndyr grounde
So at the laste he hath his tyme Ifounde
To make hise Iapis and hise wrechedenesse
Of swich a supersticious cursedenesse
  
Hise tablis colletanes  forth he brouȝte
fful weel correctid  ne there lakkede nough
Neythir his collect  ne his expans ȝeeris
Ne hise rotis ne hise othere geris
As been hise sentris and hise argumentis
And hise proporciounnys conuenyentis
ffor hise equatious  in euery thyng
And by his 8e speere  in his werkyng
He knew ful weel  hu fer Alnath was schoue
ffro the hed of thilke  fixe aries aboue
That in the nynte speere considered is
fful subtily he calkelid al this
Whan he hadde founde his fyrste mancioun
He knew the remenaunt  by proporcyoun
And knew tharysyng of the moone weel
And in whos face and terme euerideel
And knew ful weel the monys mancioun
Acordaunt to his operacioun
And knew also hise othere obseruauncis
ffor sweche illusiounnys and sweche myschauncis
As hethene folk vsedyn  in thilke dayis
ffor which no lengere makyth he delayis
But thour his magik for a wyke or tweye
It semede þat alle the rokkys were aweye
 Aurelyus which that ȝit dispeyred is
Where he schal han his loue  or fare a mys
Awaytht nygh and day on this myrakele  
And whan he knew þat there was noon obstakele
That woydede weere the rokkys euerychon
Doun to hise maysteris feet he fel anoon
And seyde I woful wreche aurelyus
Thanke I ȝow lord and lady myn Venus
That me han holpyn of myne caris colde
And to the temple his weye forth hath helde
Where as he knew he schulde his lady see
And whan he saw his tyme anoon ryght he
  
With dredful herte and with humble cheere
Saluyth hath his souereyn lady deere
 Myn ryghte lady quod this woful man
Whom I most dreede and loue as I best can
And lothest weere of al this world displeese
Neere it þat I for ȝow  haue swich disese
That I muste deyen here at ȝoure fot anon
Nat wolde I telle how me is wo bygoon
But sertys othir muste I deye or pleyne
Ȝe sle me giltles for veray peyne
But of myn deth thow ȝe han no routhe
Avyseth ȝow er than ȝe breke ȝoure trouthe

Er ȝe me sle by cause that I ȝow loue
ffor madame weel ȝe wot what ȝe han hyȝt
Nat that I chalange ony thyng of ryght
Of ȝow myn souereyn lady but ȝoure grace
But in a gardyn  ȝond in swich a place
Ȝe woot ryȝt weel what ȝe behyghtyn me
And in myn hand ȝoure trouthe plyghte ȝe
To loue me god wot ȝe seyde so
Al be that I vnworthi am therto
Madame I speke it for the honour of ȝow
Moore than to saue myn hertys lyf ryȝt now
I haue don so as ȝe comaundede me
And ȝif ȝe vouche saf ȝe may go se
Doth as ȝow lyste hauyth ȝoure heste in mynde
ffor quyk or ded rygh there ȝe schul me fynde
In ȝow lyth al to do me lyue or deye  
But weel I wot the rolkis been aweye
He takyth his leue and sche astonyd stod
In al hire face nas a drope of blood
Sche wenede neuere  haue come in swich a trappe
Allas quod sche that euere this schulde happe
ffor wende I neuere by possibilite
That swich a monstre or merueyle myghte be
  
It is ageyn the prosses of nature
And hom sche goth a sorweful criature
ffor verray fer onethe may sche go
Sche wepith waylyth al a day or two
And swounnyth that routhe it was to see
But whi it was to no wyȝt tolde schee
ffor out of tounne was goon arueragus
But to hire self sche spak and seyde thus
With pale face and with ful sorweful cheere
In hire compleynt as ȝe schal aftyr heere
 Allas quod sche on the fortune I pleyne
That vndyr wrapped  hast me in thyn cheyne
ffor which to skape woot I no socour
Saue only deth  or ellys dishonour
Oon of these two  byhowith me to cheese
But natheles ȝit haue I leuere to lese
Myn lyf than of myn body to han a schame
Or knowyn myn self fals or lese myn name
And with myn deth I may been quit Iwis
Hat there nat manye a noble wyf er this
And manye a maydyn Islayn hire self allas
rathere than with hire body don trespas
Ȝis certis lo these storyis bere witnesse
Whan thretty tirauntis ful of cursedenesse
Hadde slayn Phidoun in atthenes at the feste
They comaundit his doughtren for tareste
And bryngyn here byforn hym in despit
Al nakid to fulfylle his foule delyt
And in here fadyris blood they made hem daunce
Vp on the pauement god ȝeue hym myschance
ffor which these woful maydenys ful of drede  
Rathere than thy wolde lese here maydynheede
They priuyly ben styrt into a welle
And drenkte hem seluyn as the bokys telle
 They of Messene lete enquire and seke
Of Latedomye fifty madenys eke
  
On whiche they wolde doon here lecherye
But was theere noon of al that cumpaynye
That sche nas slayn and with a good entente
Ches rathere for to deye  than assente
To been oppressed of hire maydynhede
Whi schulde I thanne to deye been en drede
 Loke ek the tyraunt aristoclides
That louede a mayden  hyghte stymphabides
Whan that hire fadyr slay was on a nyght
On to dyane temple goth sche ryȝt
And hente the emage in hire armys two
ffrom which Image wolde sche nat go
No whygh myghte hire handys of it arace
Tyl sche was slayn ryȝt in the selue place
 Now sythe that maydenys  haddyn swich dispit
To been defoyled with manys foule delyt
Weel oghte a wyf rathere hyre selue slee
Than been defoyled as it semyth mee
What schal I seye of hasdrubales wyf
That at cartage berafte hire self hire lyf
Whan sche say that romaynys wan the tounn
Sche tok hire chyldere alle and skypte adoun
Into the fer and ches rathere to deye
Than ony romayn dede hire vilanye
 Hath not lucresse Islayn hire self allas
At rome whan sche oppressed was
Of Tarquyn for hire thoughte it was a schame
To lyuyn whan sche hadde lost hire name
 The seuene maydenys of Melesye also
Han slayn hem self for verray drede and wo
rathere than folk of gaule hem schulde opperesse
Mo than a thousent storyis as I gesse
Coude I now telle as touchynge this mateere  
 Whan Hadrabate was slayn his wyf so deere
Hire selvyn slow  and leet hire blood to glyde
In Hadrabis woundis deepe and wyde
  
And seyde myn body at the leste way
There schal no man defoylyn ȝif I may
What schulde I mo ensaumplys hereof sayn
Syn that so manye  han hem selue slayn
Wel rathere than they wolde defoyled be
I wele conclude that it is bet to me
To slen myn self than ben defoyled thus
I wele been trewe vnto Arueragus
Or rathere slen myn self in sum manere
 As dede democienys doughtyr deere
Bicause sche wolde not defoylyd be
 O Cedasus it is ful greet pite
To redyn how thynne doughteryn deyedyn allas
That slow hem self for swych manere cas
 As greet a pyte was it or wel moore
The theban maydyn that for nychanore
Hire seluyn slow  ryȝt for swych maner wo
 A nothir theban maydyn dede ryȝt so
ffor on of massedoyne hadde hire oppressed
Sche with hyre deth hyre maydynhed redressed
 What schal I seyn of nycherates wyf
That for swich cas berafte hire self hyre lyf
 How trowe ȝe ek was Althebiades
Hyre loue al rathere for to deyen chees
Than for to sufferyn hyse body onburyede be
 Loo which a wyf was Alceste quod sche
 What seyth Omer of goode penolopee
As Crece knowyth of hire chastitee
 Parde of Lacedomya is wrytyn thus
That whan at troye was slayn Protheselaus
No lengere wolde sche leuyn aftyr hise day
 The same of noble porcya tellyn I may
Withoutyn Brutus coude sche nat lyue
To whom sche hadde al hol hire herte ȝyue
 The parfyte wifhod of Arthemesye  
Honoured is thour al the Barbarye
  
 O Teuta queen  thyn wyfly chastitee
To alle wyuys may a myrour bee
    
    
Thus pleynede Dorigen a day or tweye
Purposynge euere that sche wolde deye
But natheles vpon the thredde nyȝt
Hom cam Arueragus this worthy knyȝt
And axed hire why that sche weep so sore
And 

 Allas quod sche that euere was I born
Thus haue I seyd quod sche thus haue I sworn
And tolde hym al as ȝe han herd before
It nedith nat reherse ȝow no moore
This husbonde with glad cheere in frendely wyse
Answerede and seyde as I schal ȝow deuyse
Is there ought ellis  Dorigene but this
Nay nay quod sche god helpe me so as wis
This is to meche and it were godys wille
ȝa wyf quod he  lat slepyn and be stylle

ȝe sholen yuore trouthe holden by youre fay
ffor god so wysely haue mercy vpon me
I hadde wel leuere Istekyd for to be
ffor verray loue whiche that I to ȝow haue
But ȝif ȝe schulde ȝoure trouthe kepe and saue
Trouthe is the heyeste thyng that man may kepe
And with that word he brast anon to weepe
And seyde I ȝow forbede vp peyne of deth
That neuere whil ȝow lastyt lyf or breth
To wyght telle thow of this auenture
As I best may I wele myn wo endure
Ne make no cuntenaunce of heuynesse
That folk of ȝow may deme harm or gesse
And forth he clepith a squyer and a mayde
Goth forth anon with Dorigene he sayde
  
And bryngith hire to swich a place anon
They take here leue and on here weye they gon
But they ne wyste why she thidyr wente
He nolde no wight tellyn his entente
    
    
    
    
    
    
This squier which that hyȝte aurelyus  
On Dorigene that was so amerous
Of auenture happede hire to meete
Amyd the toun rygh in the quykkeste strete
As sche was boun to go the woye ful ryȝt
Toward the gardyn there that sche hadde hight
And he was to the gardynward also
ffor weel he spyed whan sche woldo go
Out of hire hous to ony maner place
But thus they mette of auenture or grace
And he saluyth hire with good entente
And axed hire whidyrward sche wente
And sche answerde half as sche were mad
Vnto the gardyn as myn husbonde bad
Myn trouthe for to holde allas allas
 Aurelius gan wonderyn of this cas
And in his herte hadde greet compassioun
Of hire and of hire lamentacioun
And of Arueragus the worthi knight
That bad hire holdyn al that sche hadde hiȝt
So loth hym was his wyf schulde breke hire trouthe
And in his herte he caughte of this greet routhe
Considerynge the beste on euery syde
That for his lust ȝit were hym leuere abyde
Than don so high a cherliche wrechedenesse
Agayns fraunchese of alle gentillesse  
ffor which in fewe wordys seyde he thus
Madame sythe to ȝoure lord Arueragus
That sithe I se his grete gentillesse
To ȝow and eek I se wel ȝoure distresse
That he were leuere han schame and that were routhe
Than ȝe to me schulde breke thus ȝoure trouthe
I haue wel leuere euere to suffere wo
Than I departe the loue bytwixe ȝow two
I ȝow relese madame into ȝoure hond
Quyt euery surement and euery bond
That ȝe han mad to me as here beforn
Sith thylke tyme which that ȝe were born
Myn trouthe I plyghte I schal ȝow neuere repreue  
Of no beheste and here I take myn leeue
As ofthe treweste and the beste wyf
That euere ȝit I knew in al myn lyf
But euery wif be war of hire byheste
On Dorigene  remembrth at the leste
Thus can a squyer doon a gentyl deede
As weel as kan a knyȝt  withoutyn drede
 Sche thankede hym vpon hire kneis al bare
And hom vnto hire husbonde is sche fare
And told hym al as ȝe han herd me seyd
And be ȝe sykyr  he was so weel apayed
That weere impossible me to wryte
What schulde I lengere  of this cas endyte
Arueragus and Dorygene  his wyf
In souereyn blysse leedyn forth here lyf
Neuere eft ne was there angyr hem betwene
He cherysseth hire ryȝt as sche were a queene
And sche was with hym trewe for eueremoore
Of these two folk ȝe gete of me no more
 Aurelyus that his cost hath al forlorn
Cursith the tyme that euere was he born
Allas quod he allas that I behyȝte
Of purede gold a thousent pound of wighte
  
On to this philysophere how schal I do
I se namoore but that I am fordo
Myn erytage mote I nedis selle
And ben a beggere heere may I nat dwelle
And schamyn al myn kynrede in this place
But I of hym may getyn betere grace
But natheles I wele of hym assaye
At serteyn dayis ȝeer be ȝer to paye
And thanke hym of his greete curteysye
Myn trouthe wele I kepe I wele nat lye
With herte sor he goth vnto his cofere
And bryngith gold vnto this philisophere
The valew of fyue hunderede pound I gesse
And hym besechith of hise gentilesse

And sayde Maystere I dare wele make a vaunte
I fayled neuere of my trouþe ȝet
ffor sykerly my dette shalle be quyt
Towardes ȝowe howe þat euere I fare
To gone a beggere in my kirtell bare
But wolde ȝe vouche saue vpon suerte
Two ȝere or þre for to respiten me
Then were I welle for elles mot I selle
Myne herytage þere nys no more to telle
Thys phylosophre soberly vnswared
And said þus when he þis worde herde
haue I not holde Couenaunte vnto þe
ȝee certes wele and truly quod he
haste þou not hade þi lady as þe lykest
No no quod he and sorowfull he siȝeþe
What was þe cause telle me yf þou can
Aurelius his tale anone began
And tolde hym alle as ȝe han hard byfore
hit nedith not to rehersen hit no more
he sayd Arueragus of gentilnes  
hade leuere dye in sorowe and dystresse
  
Than hys wyf were of hir trouþe false
The · sorowe of Doregen he tolde hym alse
howe · loþe hir was to ben a wykked wyf
And þat she leuere þat day loste · hir lyf
And þat hir trouþe she · swore þorough Innocence
Sche neuere erste herd speke of apparence
þat made me han of hir so grete pite
And riȝt as frely as he sent hir me
As frely sent I hir to hym agayne
Thys ys alle and somme þere nys no more to sayne
Thys phylosofre answered leue broþer
Euere yche of you did gentilnesse to oþere
þou arte a squyer and he ys a knyȝt
But god forbede for hys blysfull myȝt
But ȝif a Clerk couþe do a gentel dede
As wele as ony of you withouten drede
Sir I relese þe þi þousand pounde
As þou riȝt nowe were cropen oute of grounde
Ne neuere or nowe hadest þou knowe me

It ys ynouȝe and fare wele and haue god day
And toke his hors and forth he gothe hys way
Lordynges þis question wylle I axe nowe
Whiche was þe most fre as þenkeþe you
Now telleþe me or þat I ferthere wende
I can no more my tale ys at an ende
There was as tellith me Titus lyueus
A knyȝt þat clepid was Virgineus
Fulfyllyd of honoures and of worþinesse
And stronge of ffrendes and of grete rychesse  
A douȝtyr he hade by hys wyf
And neuere hade he mo in alle hys lyf·
ffayre was þis mayde in excellent beute
Abouen euery wyȝt þat man may see·
ffor nature haþe with souereyne diligence
ffourmyd hir in so grete excellence
As þouȝe she wolde say loo I nature
Thus can I forme and peynt a creature
Whan þat me lyst who can me counterfet
Pignalyon nouȝt þouȝe he alwey forge and bete
Or graue or peynte for y dare wele sayne
Apollus ȝepherus shulde worche in vayne
To graue or peynte or forge or bete
ȝif þei presumyd me forto conterfete
ffor he þat ys þe formour principal
Hath made me his Viker general
To forme and peynte eche erthly creature
Ryȝt as me lyste for alle thynge ys in my cure
Vnder þe mone þat may wane or waxe
And for my werke no þenge wille I axe
  
My lord and I ben fully at accorde
I made hir to þe worshipe of my lord
So do I alle myne oþere creatures·
Of what coloure þei be or what figures
þus semethe me þat nature wolle say
This mayde was of age twelue ȝeere and twey
In whiche þat nature hath suche delyte
For riȝt as she can peynte as lyly white
And rudy as roose riȝt with suche paynture
She paynteth hath þis noble creature
Or she was borne vpon hir lymes fre
Were also bryȝt as suche coloures shuld be
And Phebus dyed hade hir tressys grete
Lyke to þe stremes of his bornyd heete
And ȝif þat excellent was hir beaute·
A þousand sithe more Vertuouse was she  
In her ne lacked no condicioun
That ys to preyse as by discrecioun
As wele in body as goste Chast was she
ffor whiche she floured in Virgynite
With alle humilite and abstynence
With alle temperance and pacience
With mesure eke and berynge of array
Discrete she was in answerynge alway
Though she were wys as Pallas dar I sayne
hir faucond eke fulle womanly and pleyne
None counterfetid termes hade she
To seme wys but  aftyr hir degre
Sche spake alle hir wordes more and lesse
Sounynge in vertu and in gentilnesse
Constant in hert  and euere in besynesse
Schamefaste she was in maydens shamefastnesse
To dryue hir oute of hir slougardye
Bacus hade of hir mouthe no Maystrie
ffor wylle and þouȝt done Venus encrece
As men in fyre wille casten oyle or grece
  
And of hir owen vertu vnconstreyned
She hathe fulle ofte tyme hir seeke feyned
ffor þat she wolde fle þe companye
Where likly was to treten of foly
As ys at feestes Reueles and at daunces

Suche thynge maken · Chyldren for to be
To sone rype and bolde as men may see
Whyche ys fulle peryllous and hath bene yore
ffor alle to sone may she lerne lore
Of boldenesse whan she ys a wyf
And ȝe maystresses in youre olde lyf
þat lordes douȝters han in gouernaunce
Ne taketh of my worde no displesaunce
Thynges þat ben sette in gouernynges ·
Of lordes douȝters only for two thynges  
Ouþer for ȝe han kepte youre honeste
Oþere elles ȝe han fallen in frelete
And knowen wele ynouȝe þe olde daunce
And conne forsake fully myschaunce
ffor euermo · þerfore for crystes sake

A theefe of veneson þat hath forlaft

Nowe kepeth hem wel for and ȝe wele kan

Leest ȝe be dampned for youre euel entent

And taketh of þat þat I shal sayn
Of alle tresoun suffreyn pestelence

Thogh ȝe haue Childre by it one or two

Whiles þei bene vnder gouernaunce

Suffiseth on · ensample nowe as here

Sche kepte hir selfe hir nedeth no maystresse

Sche was so prudent and so bounteuous ·
ffor whiche oute spronge on euery syde
Bothe of hir beaute and of hir bounte wyde  
þat þorouȝe þe londe þei preysed hir eccheone
That louyd vertu safe Envie allone

And glad ys of hys sorowe and vnhele
The docture maketh þis discripcioun
Thys mayde wente on a day into þe toun
Toward þe temple with hir moder dere
As ys of yonge maydens þe manere
 Now was þere a Iustice in þe toun

And so byfelle thys Iuge hys eyȝen caste
Vpon þis mayde avisynge hir fulle faste
As she come forth by þere þe Iuge stoode
Anone his hert chaungeth and hys mode
So was he cauȝt with beaute of þis mayde
And to hym · self fulle pryuely he saide
Thys mayde shalle be myne for ony man
Anoone þe feende into hys hert ranne
And tauȝte hym sodeynly by what sleiȝt
þe mayde to hys purpos wynne he myȝt
  
ffor certes by no force ne by no mede

ffor he was stronge of frendes and eke she
Confermyd was in suche souereyne beaute
þat wele he wyste he myȝt hir nevere wynne
As for to make hir with hir body synne
ffor whiche with grete deliberacioun
he sent aftyr a Clerk into þe toun
The whiche he knewe for sotelle and for bolde
Thys Iuge vnto þis Clerk his tale hathe tolde
I secre wyse and made hym to assure
he shulde telle it to no creature
And ȝif he did he shulde lese hys hede
Whan ascented was þis cursid reede
Glad was þe Iuge and made glad chere
And ȝafe hym ȝiftes precious and dere  
Whan shapen was alle þis conspiracie
ffrom poynt to poynt how þat his lecherie
Perfourmed shulde be fulle sotelly
As ȝe shalle here and afterward opunly
home gothe þis Clerk þat hiȝt Claudius
Thys false Iuge þat hiȝt Apius
So was hys name for it ys no fable
But knowen for an historialle þenge notable
The sentence of hit · sothe ys oute of doute
Thys false Iuge gothe nowe faste aboute
To hasten his delyte al þat he may
And so byfelle sone after on a day
Thys false Iuge as tellethe vs þe storie
As he was wonte sat in his consistorie
And ȝaue his domes vpon sundry caas
This false clerke come forthe a wele gode paas
And said lord ȝif it be youre wille
Ȝis dothe me riȝt vpon þis pitous bille
In which I pleyne vpon virginius  
And ȝif he wele seyn it is not thus
  
I wele it preue  and fynde it good witnesse
That soth is that myn bille wele expresse
The Iuge answerde  of this in his absence
I may not ȝeue diffynytiue sentence
Lat do hym calle and I wele gladli here
Thow schalt haue alle ryȝt and no wrong heere
Virgynyus cam to wete the Iugis wille
And ryȝt anon was rad this curssede bylle
The sentence of it was as ȝe schul here
To ȝow myn lord sire apius so deere
Schewith ȝoure poure seruaun claudyus
How that a knygh  callyd virgynyus
Ageyns the lawe ageyn alle equyte
Holdyth expres ageyn the wil of me
Myn seruant which that 1is myn1 thral be ryȝt
Whiche from myn hous was stole vpon a nyȝt
Whil that sche was ful ȝyng this wele I preue
By witnesse lord so that it nat ȝow greue
Sche nys his doughty nat what so he seye
Wherefore to ȝow myn lord ȝe Iuge I preye
Ȝilde me my thral  ȝif þat it be ȝoure wille
Lo this was al the sentens of his bille
Virginius gan vpon the cherl beholde
But hastyly er he his tale tolde
And wolde a preued it as schulde a knyȝt
And ek by witnesse of manye a wight
That it was fals that seyde his aduersarye
This cursede Iuge wolde no thyng tarye
Ne here a word more of virginius
But ȝaf his Iugement and seyde thus
I deme anoon  this cherl his seruaunt haue
Thow schalt no lengere  in thyn hous here saue3

Go brynge hire forth  and putte hire in owere warde
This cherl schal han  his thral this I awrarde
And whan this worthi  knyȝt virgynyus
Thour sentence  of this Iustyse Apyus
  
Muste be forse his dere douȝtyr ȝeuy  
Vnto the Iuge in lecherye to lyuyn
He goth hym hom and settyth hym in his halle
And leet anon his deere douȝtyr calle
And with a face ded as aschyn colde
Vpon hire humble face he gan byholde
With faderys pite styngynge thour his herte
Al wolde he not from his purpos conuerte
Douȝtyr quod he virginia bi thyn name
There been two woyis othir ded or schame
That þou muste suffere allas that I was bore
ffor neuere thow deseruedist wherefore
To deyen with a swerd or wit a knyf
O deere douȝtyr endere of myn lyf
Which I haue fostered vp with swich plesaunce
That thow were neuere out of myn remembraunce
O douȝtyr which that art myn laste wo
And in myn lyf myn laste Ioye also
O gemme of chastite in pacience
Take thow thyn deth for this is myn sentence
ffor loue and not for hate þou muste be deed
Myn pitous hand mote smytyn of thyn heed
Allas that euere apius the say
Thus hath he falsely Iuged the to day
And tolde hire al the case as ȝe before
Han herd  nought nedyth for to telle it more
O mercy dere fadyr quod this mayde
And with that word sche bothe hire armys layde
Aboute his nekke as sche was wont to do
The teris broste out of hise eyen two
And seyde goode fadyr schal I deye
Is there no grace is there no remedye
No certis dere douȝtyr myn quod he
Thanne ȝeue me leue fadyr myn quod sche

Parde Iepte ȝaf his douȝtyr grace
  
ffor to compleyne er he hire slow allas
And god it wot no thyng was hire trespas

To welcome hym with grete sollempnite
And with þat worde she felle on swoune anoone
And aftyr whan hir swonynge was gone
Sche risethe vp and to hir fadir sayde
Blessyd be god þat I shalle deye a mayde
ȝif me my dethe or þat I haue a shame
Dothe with youre childe youre wille of goddes name
And with þat worde she praythe fulle ofte
þat with his swerde he shulde smyte hir softe
And with þat worde on swone doune she felle
Hir fadyr with fulle sorowfulle hert and fel
Hir heede of smote and by þe top it hent
And to þe Iuge he yaue it to present  
As he sat in hys dome in consistorie
What þe Iuge it sawe as saithe þe storie
He bade take hym and honge hym also faste
But riȝt anoon alle þe peple in þraste
To saue þe knyȝt for reuthe and for pite
ffor knowen was þe folys Iniquyte
The peple anone hade suspecte in þis thynge
By manere of thys Clerkes chalengynge
That it was by þe assent of Apius·
They wyste wele þat he was lecherous·
ffor whiche vnto þis Apius þei gone
And kysten hym in prison riȝt anone
Where as he slouȝe hym self and claudius
þat seruaunt was vnto þis apius
Was demed for  hange vpon a tre
But Virgineus of his grete pite
Prayde for hym þat he was exiled
And elles certes he hade be begyled·
The remenaunt were honged more and lesse
þat consentid weren to his cursidnesse
  
here may men see how synne hathe hys merite
Be ware for no man wote howe god wille smyte
In no degre ne in whiche manere wyse·
The worme of conscience wylle aryse
Of wycked lyf þouȝe it so preue be
þat no man woote of hit but god and he
Wheþere he be lewed man or leryd
he note howe sone þat he may ben aferyd·
Therfore I rede you þis counselle take
fforsakeþe synne or synne you forsake

Oure oste gan swere as he were woode
Harrowe quod he by nayles and by bloode
Thys was a false Clerk and a false Iustice
As shamefulle deth as tonge can deuyse  
Come to þe Iustice and hir aduocase
Algate þis sely woman ys slayne Alas
Alas  dere abouȝte she Bewte
Wherfore I say al day þat men may see
þat ȝift of fortune or of nature
Ben cause of dethe of many a creature
    
    
As bothe ȝiftes as I speke of nowe
Men han fulle ofte more harme þen prowe
But truly myn owen Maystre dere
Thys ys a pitous tale forto here
But natheles passe ouere ys no force
I pray to god so saue þi gentel corse
And þine vrynales and þyne Ioudans
Thyne ypocras and eke þi galyans·
And euery Boxe fulle of þi letuary
God blesse hem and oure lady seynt mary
So mot I the þou art a propre man
And Ilyke a prelate be seynt Runyan
Saue þat I kon not speke wele in terme
But wele I woote þou doest myn hert erme

By corps bones but yf I haue treacle
Or elles a drauȝt of moost or corny ale
Or but I here anone a mery tale

Than belamy Iohn perdoner he sayd
Telle vs some myrthe or some Iapes here anone

But first quod he at þe next ale stake

But riȝt anone þise gentelys gan to crye
Nay let hym telle vs of no rebaudrye
Tel vs some moral thenge þat we may here
Some wytte and þan wille we gladly here

Radix omnium malorum est cupiditas

And þan my bulles shewen alle and somme
Oure lege lordes seal on my patent
þat shewe I fyrst my body to warant
That no man be so bolde prest nor Clerk
Me to disturbe of crystes holy werke
And after þat telle I forthe my tales
Bulles of Popes and of Cardynales
Of Patryarkes and Bysshopes I shewe
And in laten I speke wordes fewe
To sauere with my predicacioun
And forto styrre men to deuocioun
þan shewe I forth my longe Cristal stones
Icrommed fulle of cloutys and of bones
Relikes þei bene as wene þei ychone

Whiche þat was an holy Iewes shepe
Goode men say I take at my wordes kepe
ȝif þat þis bone be wasshen in a welle

Aboute þe herte or elles þe longe
  
And it is hole anone and ferthermore
Of pockes and of scabbe and of euery sore
Shall euery shepe be hole þat of þis welle
Drenkyth a draught take hede what I telle
Ȝif þat þe godeman þat þe bestes ouȝte
Wolle euery wooke or þat þe Cok hym crouthe

As þilke holy Iewe oure eldres tauȝt

And sires also it heleth Ielousey
And þouȝe a man be fallen in a Ielouse rage
let maken with þis water hys potage
And neuere shal he hys wyf mystruste
Thouȝe he þe sothe of his defaute wyste
Alle hade she taken preestes two or thre

Whan he hathe sowen be it Whete or Otes
So þat he brynge me gode pans or elles grotes
And men and women oo þenge I warne you
Ȝif ony wiȝt be in þis Chirche nowe

Dare not for shame of it shryuen be
Or ony woman be she yonge or olde
þat hath made hir husbonde Cokewolde
Suche folke shul haue no power ne no grace
To offre to my relleckes in þis place
And who fyndeth hym oute of suche blame
They wol come vp and offre in goddes name
And I assolie hym be the autorite  
Which that by bulle is grauntid onto me
By this gaude haue I wonne ȝeer be ȝeer
An hunderede mark sythe I was pardounneer
I stonde lyk a clerk in myn pulpet
And whan that the lewede peple is doun Iset
  
I preche so as ȝe han herd byfore
And telle an hunderede false Iapis more
Thanne peyne I me to streche forth myn nekke
And est and west vpon the peple I bekke
As doth a douue syttynge on a berne
Mynne handys and myn tunge goon so ȝerne
That it is Ioye to se myn besynesse
Of auarice and of swich cursedenesse
Is al myn prechyng for to makyn hem fre
To ȝeuyn here penys and nameli onto me
ffor myn entent is not but for to wynne
And no thyng for correccioun of synne
I rekke neuere whanne that they been beryed
Thow that here soulis goon a blakeberyed
ffor certis manye a predicacioun
Comyth ofte of euele entencioun
Some for plesaunce of folk and flaterye
To been avansed be ypocrysie
And some for veynglorie and some for hate
And whanne I dar non othere woyis debate
Thanne wele I stynge men with myn tunge smerte
In prechynge so that I schal nat asterte
To been defamyd falsely that he
Hath trespased to myne brothir or to me
ffor thow I telle nat his proper name
Men schal wel knowe þat it is the same
By sygnys and be othere circumstauncis
Thus quyte I folk that don vs displesauncis
Thus spitte I out myn venym vndyr hewe
Of holynesse to semyn holy and trewe
But schortely myn entent I wele deuyse
I preche of no thyng but of coueytyse
Therefore myn teme is ȝit and euere was  
Radix malorum est cupiditas
Thus can I preche aȝen the same vice
Whiche that I vse and that is aueryce
  
But thow myn self be gilty in that synne
Ȝit can I make othere folk to twynne
ffrom aueryce and sore to repente
But that is nat myn pryncipal entente
I preche no thyng but for coueytyse
Of this matire it ouȝte Inogh suffise
Thanne telle I hem ensaumplys many on
Of olde storyis long tyme a goon
ffor lewede peple louyn talys olde
Sweche thyngis can they wel reporte and holde
What trowe ȝe that whilis that I may preche
And wynne gold and syluyr for I teche
That I wele lyue in pouerte wilfully
Nay nay I thouȝte it neuere trewely
ffor I wele preche and begge in sundery landis
I wele don no labour with mynne handys
Ne make basketys and lyue therby
By cause I wele nat beggen ydely

Al weere it ȝeuyn of the poreste page
Or of the poreste wedew in a village
Al schulde hire chylderyn sterue for famyne
Nay I wele drynke licour of the vyne
And haue a Ioly wenche in euery toun
But herkenyth lordyngis in conclusioun
Ȝoure lykynge is that I schal telle a tale
Now haue I dronke a draught of corny ale
By god I hope I schal ȝowe telle a thyng
That schal be resoun been at ȝoure lykyng
ffor thow myn self be a ful vicious man
A moral tale ȝit I ȝow telle can
Whiche I am wonet to preche for to wynne
Now holde ȝoure pes myn tale I wele begynne


IN flanderys whilhom dwellede a cumpaynye
Of ȝonge folk that hauntedyn folye

To kyndele and blowe the fyr of lecherye  
That is annexed onto Glotenye

That luxurye is in wyn and dronkenesse
Lo how that dronkyn looth vnkyndely

So dronke he was he nyste what he wrouȝte

Rygh at his owene table he ȝaf his heste
To slen the Baptist Iohn ful gilteles
Senek seyth a good word douteles
He seyth he can no difference fynde
Bytwixe a man that is out of his mynde
And a man which that is dronkelewe
But that wodnesse Ifallyn in a schrewe
Perseueryth lengere than doth dronkenesse
O glotenye ful of cursedenesse
O cause fyrst of oure confusioun
O original of oure dampnacioun
Til Cryst hadde bouȝt vs with his blod ageyn
Lo how deere schortely for to seyn
Abovghte was thilk cursede vilanye
Corrup was al this world for glotenye

Were dreuyn for that vice it is no drede
ffor whil that adam fasted as I rede
He was in paradys  and thil that he
Eet of the freut defendit of the tre
Anon he was out cast to wo and pyne
O glotenye on the  wel ouȝte vs pleyne
O wiste a man how manye maladyis

He wolde been the moore mesurable
Of his dyete syttynge at his table
Allas the schorte throte the tendere mouth

Of this matire  O paul weel canst thow trete

Of whiche the ende is deth  wombe is here god

O dronke man  disfigured is thyn face

Oof mannys wit and his discrecioun
In whom that drynk hath dominacioun

Now kepe ȝow from the white and from the reede
And namely from the white wyn of lepe
That is to selle in fiche streete or in Chepe
This wyn of spayne crepyth subtily
In othere wynys growynge faste by
Of which there rysith swich fumosite
That whan a man haue dronkyn drauȝtis thre
And weneth that he be at hom in chepe
He is in spayne ryȝt at the toun of leepe
Nat at rochel  ne at burdeux toun
And thanne wele he seye sampsoun sampsoun
But herkenyth lordyngis o word I ȝow preye
That alle the souereyn actis dar I seye
Of victoryis in the olde testament
Thurgh verray god that is omnypotent
Were don in abstinence and in preyere
Lokyth the bible and there ȝe may it leere
Loke attilla the greete conquerour
Deyede in his slep  with schame and dishonour
Bledynge at his nose in dronkenesse
A Capitayn schulde leue in soberenesse
And ouyr al this  aviseth ȝow ryȝt weel
What was comaundit to Lamuel
Nat Samuel but Lamuel seye I
Redyth the byble  and fynde it expresly
Of wyn ȝeuynge to hem that han iustise
Namore of this for it may Inough suffyse
And now that I haue spokyn of glotenye
Now wele I ȝow defende hasarderye
Hasard is verray modyr of lesyngis
And of disseyd and cursede forsweryngis
Blaspheme of Cryst manslauȝt and wast also
Of catel of tyme  and ferthere mo
 It is repref and contrarye to honour  
ffor to ben holdyn a comoun hasardour
  
And euere the heyere he is of 1estat1
The moore is he holdyn desolat
ȝif that a prynce vseth hasarderye
In alle gouernaunce and polycie
He is as be comune opinioun
Iholde the lesse in reputacioun
Stilboun þat was a wys Embassadour
Was sent to Corenthe in ful greet honour
ffrom latidomye to makyn hire allyaunce
And whan he cam hym happede par chaunce
That alle the gretteste that were of that lond
Pleyinge at the hasard he hem fond
ffor which as soone as it myghte be
He stal hym hom ageyn into his cuntre
 And seyde there wel I nat leese myn name
Nay wil nat take on me so greet diffame
Ȝow for to alye vnto none hasardourys
Sendyth othere wyse embassadourys
ffor be myn trouthe me were leuere dye
Than I ȝow schulde to hasardourys alye
ffor ȝe that been so gloryous in honourys
Schal not alye ȝow to hasardourys
By myn wil ne as bi myn tretee
This wyse philisophere thus seyde he
Loke ek that to the kyng demetryus
The kyng of Parthes as the bok seyth vs
Sente hym a payre of deis of gold in scorn
ffor he hadde vsed hasard there byforn
ffor which he held his glorye or his renoun
At no valu or reputacioun
 Lordis may fynde other maner pley
Honeste Inow to dryue the day awey
Now wele I speke of othes false and greete
A word or two as olde bokys trete
Greet swerynge is a thyng abhominable
And fals swerynge 2is ȝit2 more repreuable
  
The hye god forbad swerynge at al  
Witnesse of Mathew but in special
Of swerynge seyth the holy Ieremye
Thow schalt swere soth thynne othis and not lye
And swere in dom and ek in ryghtwysnesse
But ydele swerynge is a cursedenesse
Bihold and se that in the ferste table
Of heye goddys hestis honurable
How that the secounde heste of hym is this
Take nat myn name in idil or amys
Lo rathere he forbedyth sweche swerynge
Than homyside or manye a cursede thyng
I seye that as by ordere thus it standith
This knowith that his bokys vndirstonde
How that the secunde heste of god is that
And ferthere ouyr  I wele the telle al plat
That vengeaunce schal nat passe from his hous
That of hise othis is to outrageous
By godys precyus herte and by hise naylys
And by the blod o crist that is in haylys
Seuene is myn chaunce  and thyn is synk and treye
By godys armys ȝif thow falsely pheye
This daggar schal thorgh out thyn herte go
This freut comyth of þe bicche bonys two
fforswerynge Ire falsenesse homysyde
Now for the loue of cryst þat for vs deyede
Leveth ȝoure swerynge bothe greete and smale
But serys now wele I telle forth myn tale
Theise riotourys thre of whiche I telle
Longe erst er pryme rong the belle
Were sett hem in a tauerne to drynke
And as the sat  they herde a belle 2clynke2
Byforn a cors was caryed to his graue
That on of hem gan callyn to his knaue
Go bet quod he and axe redyly
What cors is this that caryed is forby
  
And loke that thow reporte his name wel
Sere quod this boy it nedyth neuere a deel
It was me told er ȝe cam here thre ouris  
He was parde an old felawe of ouris
And sodeynly he was Islayn to nyght
ffordronke as he sat on his bench vp ryȝt
There cam a priue thef men clepyn deth
That in this cuntre al the peple sleth
And with his spere he smot his herte atwo
And wente his weie withoutyn wordis mo
And maystir er ȝe come in his presence
He hath a thousent slayn this pestelence
Methynkyth that it were necessarye
ffor to ben war of swich an aduersarye
Beth redy for to mete hym euere more
Thus thaute me myn dame I seye nomore
Be seynte marie seyde this tauernere
The child seyth soth for he hath slayn this ȝere
Hene ouyr a myle withinne a greet village
Bothe man and woman child and hewe and page
I trowe his habitacioun be there
To been avised greet wisdam it weere
Er that he deyede a man a dishonour
 Ye goddis armys quod this riotour
Is it swich peril with hym for to mete
I schal hym seeke by woye and ek bi streete
I make a wow to goddys digne bonys
Herkenyth felawis we thre been alonys
Lat ych of vs holdyn vp his hand to othir
And eche of vs bicomyn otherys brothir
And we wele sleen this false traytour deth
He schal been slayn he that so manye sleth
By godis dygnete er it be nygh
Togederys han these thre here treuthes plyght
To lyuyn and deyen eche of hem with othyr
As though he were his owe bore brothir
  
And vp they stertyn and dronkyn in this rage
And forth they gon towardys that village
Of whiche the tauerner hadde spoke byforn
And manye a gresely oth thanne han they sworn
And crystis blyssede body they torente  
Deth schal ben ded ȝif they may hym hente
Whan they han goon nat fully half a myle
Ryght as they woldyn a trodyn ouyr a style
An old man and a poure 1with hem1 mette
This olde man ful mekely hem grette
And seydyn thus now lordis god ȝow see
The proudeste of these ryatourys three
Answerede agayn what cherl with sory grace
Why art thow forwrappid saue thyn face
Why lyggist thow so longe in so greet age
This olde man gan lokyn in his visage
And seyde thus for I ne can nat fynde
A man thow I walkede into ynde
Neythir in cete ne in non village
That wolde chaunge his ȝouthe for myn age
And therfore mote I holde myn age stylle
As long tyme as it is godys wille
Ne deth allas wele nat han myn lyf
Thus walke I lych a recheles caytyf
And on the ground whiche is myn moderys gate
I knokke with myn staf bothe erly and late
And seye leue modyr lete me in
Lo how I vanyche bothe flesch and blood and skyn
Allas whanne schal myne bonys been at reste
Modyr with ȝow wolde I schaunge myn cheste
That in myn chaumbre long tyme hath be
Ȝa for an heyre clout to wrappe me
But ȝit to me ȝe wele nat do that grace
ffor which ful pale and welkid is myn face
But syrys to ȝow it is no curteysye
To spekyn to an old man vilanye
  
But he trespace in word or ellis in dede
In holy wryt ye may youre seluyn weel reede

Ȝe shulde aryse  wherfore I ȝeue ȝow red  
Ne doth vnto an old man noon harm now
Na more than ȝe wolde men dede to ȝow
In age ȝif that ȝe so longe abyde
And god be wyth ȝow where ȝe go or ryde
I mot go thedyr there I haue to go  
 Nay olde cherl by god thow schat nat so
Seyde this othir hasardour anon
Thow partist nat so lyȝtely by seynt Iohn
Thow speke ryȝt now of thilke traytour deth
That in oure cuntre alle oure frendys sleth
Haue here myn treuthe as thow art his espie
Telle where he is  or  thow schalt it abye
By god and by holye sacrement
ffor sothly thow art of his assent
To sleen vs ȝonge folk thow false thef
Now seris quod he syn that ye be so lef
To fynde deth turne vp this crokede wey
ffor in that groue I lefte hym by myn fey
Vndyr a tre and there he wolde abyde
Nat for youre bost he wele hym nat hyde
Se ye that ook ryȝt there ye schul hym fynde
God saue yow that boughte aȝen mankynde
And ȝow amende thus seyde this olde man
 And eueryche of these ryotourys ran
Til they come to that tre and there they founde
Of floreynys fyne of gold Icoynede rounde
Wel nygh an viij buschellis as hem thouȝte
No lengere thanne aftyr deth they souȝte
But eche of hem so glad was of the syght
ffor that floreynys been so fayre and bryȝt
That doun they sette hem by this precious hord
The werste of hem spak the ferste word
  
Bretheryn quod he thyng what I seye
Myn wit is greet thow that I borde and pleye
This tresore hath fortune vnto vs ȝeuyn
In myrthe and Iolyte oure lyf to leuyn
And lyghtely as it comyth so wele we spende
Ey godys precyous dignetee ho wende
To day that we schuldyn han so fayr grace
But myghte this gold been caryed from this place
Hom to myn hous or ellys vnto ȝourys
ffor weel ȝe wot that al this gold is ourys
Thanne were we in high felicite  
But treweli by day it may nat be
Men woldyn seyn that we were thevis stronge
And for oure owene tresore doon vs honge
This tresore muste Icaryede been by nyght
As wysely and as slyly as men myght
Therefore I rede that cut among vs alle
Be drawe and lat se where the cut wele falle
And he that hat the cut with herte blythe
Schal renne to tounne and that ful swythe
And brynge vs breed and wyn pryuyly
And two of vs schal kepen subtily
This tresor wel  if he wele nat tarye
Whan it is nyght we wele this tresore carye
By on assent  where as vs thynkyth best
That on of hem the Cut brouȝte in his fest
And bad hem drawe and loke wheere it wolde falle
And it fel on the ȝongest of hem alle
And forth toward the toun he wente anon
And al so soone as þat he was goon
That oon of hem spak onto that othyr
Thow knowyst weel thow art myn swore brothir
Thyn profyt wele I telle the anoon
Thow wist weel that oure falawe is goon
And heere is gold and that ful greet plentee
That schal departid be among vs three
  
But natheles If I can speke it so
That it departyd were among vs two
Hadde I nat doon a frendys turn to thee
That othir answerde I not how that may bee
He wot that the gold is with vs tweye
What schal we do what schal we to hym seye
Schal it be conseyl seyde the ferste schrewe
And I schal tellyn in a wordys fewe
What we schal doon and brynge it weel aboute
I graunte quod that othyr out of doute
That by myn trouthe I wele the nat bywrye
Now quod he thow wost weel that we ben twye
And two of vs schal strengere been than oon  
Loke whan he is set that ryȝt anoon
Arys as thow woldys with hym pleye
And I schal ryue hym thour the sydys tweye
Whil that thow strogelyst with hym as in game
And with thyn daggere loke thow do the same
And thanne schal al this gold departid be
Myn deere frend betwixe me and the
Thanne may we bothe oure lustis al fulfylle
And pleye at the deis ryȝt at oure owene wille
And thus acordede been these schrewys tweye
To sleen the thredde as ȝe han herd me seye
 This ȝongeste wyght that wente to the toun
fful ofte in hese herte he rollede vp and doun
The beute of the floreynys newe and brighte
O lord quod he If so were that I myȝte
Haue al thes tresor to myn self alone
There is no man that lyuyth vndyr the trone
Of good that schulde liue so merye as I
And at the laste the fend oure enemy
Put in his herte  that he schulde poysounne 2beye2
With whiche he myghte sleen hise felawis tweye
ffor why the fend fond hym in swich lyuynge
That he hadde leue hem to sorwe brynge
  
This was vttyrly his entente
To slen hem bothe and neuere to repente
And forth he goth no lengere wolde he tarye
Into the toun vnto a potecarye
And preyede hym that he hym wolde selle
Sum poysoun that he myȝte hise rattis quelle
And eek there was a polkat in his hawe
That as he seyde his capounnys hadde he slawe
And fayn he wolde wreke hym ȝif he myȝte
On vermyn that destroyede hym be nyghte
 The potecarye answerde and thow schalt haue
A thyng that also god myn soule saue
In al this world there is no creature
That etyn or drynk of this confyture
Nat but the moutenaunce of a corn of wheete  
That he schal his lyf anoon forleete
Ya sterue he schal and that in lasse while
Than thow wylt gon a pas nat but a myle
The poysoun is so strong and violent
 This cursede man hath in his hond Ihent
The poysoun in a box and sythe he ran
Into the nexte streete vnto a man
And borwede hym large botellys tre
And in the two his pousoun pourede he
The thredde he kepte clene for his drynk
ffor al the nygh he schop hym for to swynk
In caryinge of that gold out of that place
And whan this ryotour with sory grace
Hadde fylled wyth wyn hise greete botellis thre
To hise felas ageyn repayrede hee
 What neede of it to sarmone moore
ffor ryȝt as they hadde cast his deth byfore
Rygh so they han hym slayn and that anoon
And whan this was doon thus spak that oon
Now lat vs sitte and drynke and make vs merye
And aftyr that we wele his body berye
  
And with that word it happede hym percas
To take the botel there the poysoun was
And drank and ȝaf his felawe dynke also
ffor whiche anoon they storve bothe two
 But certys I suppose that Aucyen
Wrot neuere in no canoun ne in no fen
Mo wondere sygnys of enpoysounnynge
Than hadde these wrechis two er hire endynge
Thus endede been these homycidis two
And ek the false enpoysonere also
 O cursede synne of alle cursedenesse
O traytourys homycyde  o wikkedenesse
O glotonye  luxurye  and hasarderye
Thow blasphemere of cryst with vilonye
And othis greete of vsage and of pryde
Allas mankynde how may it betyde
That to thyn creatour whiche that the wrough  
And with hise precious blood the bough
Thow art so fals and so vnkynde allas
Now goode men god forȝeue ȝow ȝoure trespas
And ware ȝow from the synne of aueryce
Myn holy pardoun may ȝow alle waryce
So that ȝe offere  noblis or starlyngis
Or ellys syluyr sponys brochis ryngis
Bowith ȝoure heed vndyr this holy bulle
Comyth vp ȝe wyuys offerith of ȝoure wolle
Ȝoure name I entere here in myn rolle anon
Into the blysse of heuene schul ȝe gon

As ȝe weryn born and lo seris thus I preche
And Ihesu cryst that is oure soulys leche
So graunte ȝow his pardoun to resceyue
ffor that is best I wele ȝou nat disceyue
But seris on word forgat I in myn tale
I haue relikys and pardoun in myn male
  
As fayre as ony man in yngeland
Whiche were me ȝouyn by the popis hand
Ȝyf ony of yow wele of deuocyoun

Comyth forth anon and knelyth here adoun
And mekely resseyuyth myn pardoun
Or ellis takyth pardoun as ȝe weende

So that ȝe offere alwey newe and newe
Nobelis and penys whiche that been goode and trewe
It is an honour to eueriche that is here
That ye mowen haue a suffycient pardonere
To asoyle ȝow in cuntre as ȝe ryde
ffor auenture whiche that may betyde
Perauenture there may falle on or two

Loke which a seurete it is to ȝow alle
That I am in ȝoure felaueschepe Ifalle
That may assoyle ȝow bothe more and lasse  
Whan that the soule schal from the body passe
I rede that oure ost here schal begynne
ffor he is most enuolupid in synne
Come forth sere ost and offere here anon
And thow schat kysse myne relykys euerychoon
Ye for a groote vnbokele anoon thyn pors

Lat be quod he it schal nat be so theech
Thow woldyst make me to kysse thynno olde brech
And swere it weere a relike of a seynt
They it were with tyn fundement depeynt
But by the cros that seynt elyne fond
I wolde I hadde thyne colyounnys in myn hond
In stede of relikys or of seyntewarye
Let kutte hem of I wele from the hem carye
They schul been schrynyd in an hoggis tord
This pardouner answerde nat a word
  
So wroth he was he wolde no word seye
Now quod oure ost I wele no lengere pleye
With the ne with noon othyr angery man
But rygh anoon the worthy knygh began
Whan that he saw that al the peple lough
Na moore of this for it is ryght Inough
Sire pardoneer be merie and glad of cheere
And sere ost that been to me so deere
I preye ȝow that ȝe kysse the pardounneer
And pardounner I preye the drawe the neer
And as we dede lat vs laughe and pleye
Anon they kyste and rede forth here weye
A Marchaunt whilom dwellyd at seynt denys
þat riche was for which men helde hym wys
A wyfe he hade of excellent beaute
And compenable and reuerent was she
Whiche ys a thynge þat causeth more dispense
þan worthe ys alle þe chere and reuerence
þat men hem done at festees and at daunces
Suche salutacions and contenaunces
Passeth as doth þe shadowe vpon a walle
But woo ys hym þat payen mot for alle
þe cely husbonde algate he mot paie
he mote vs clothe and vs arraie
Alle for his owne worship rychely
In whiche arraie we dauncen Iolilye
And yf þat he may not parauenture
Or elles luste none suche espense to endure
But thynkith þat it is waste and yloste
þan mote anoþere paien for oure coste
Or lene vs golde and þat ys perilous
This noble Marchaunt hylde a noble house
ffor wwhiche he hade alday grete repaire
ffor hys largesse and for hys wyf was faire
þat wonder ys but herkeneth to my tale
Amonges alle hys gestes grete and smale
þere was a monke a faire man and a bolde
I trowe xx wynter he was olde
þat euere in on was drawynge to þat place
þis yonge Monke þat was so faire of face
  
Aqueynted was so with þat gode man
    
    
    


And eke þis Monke of whiche I began
Were bothe two borne in oo vilage
þe Monke hym cleymed as for cosynage
And he ayeyne saith not onys nay
But was as glade as any foule of day
ffor in his hert it was a grete plesaunce
Thus bene þe knyt with eterne aliaunce
Of Bretherheed whiles þat her lyf may dure
And ilke of hem gan oþere assure
ffre was dan Iohn and namly of dispense
As in þat hous and fulle of diligence
To do plesaunce and also grete costage
he nouȝt foryate to ȝeue þe laste page
In alle þat hous but aftyr hir degre
he ȝave þe lord  and siþens his meyne
whan þat he came some manere honest thynge
ffor whiche þei were as glade for hys comynge
As foule ys fayne whan þe sonne vp rysethe
Nomore hereof as nowe for þis sufficethe
But so befelle þis Marchaunt on a day
Schope hym to make redy hys array
Toward þe town of Bruggeys for to fare
To byen þere a porcion of ware
ffor whiche he hathe to parys  sent anone
A messangere and prayed hathe Dan Iohn
þat he shulde come to seynt Denys to pleye
with hym and with his wyf a day or tweye
Or he to bruggeys went in alle wyse
This noble Monke of whiche I you deuyse
Hath of his abbot as hym leste lycence  
Bycause he was a man of hygh prudence
  
And ek an offycer out for to ryde
To seen here granges and here bernys wyde
And vnto seynt Denys he comyth anoon
Who was so wolcome as myn lord daun Iohn
Oure deere cosyn ful of curteysye
With hym he brouȝte a Iubbe of Maluesye
And ek a nothir ful of fyn vernage
And volatyl as was his vsage
And thus I lete hem drynke and ete and pleye
This Marchaunt and this Monk a day or tweye
The thredde day this Marchaunt vp aryseth
And on hise nedis sadly hym auyseth
And vp into his countour house goth he
To rekene with hym self weel may be
Of thilke ȝeer how that it with hym stod
And how that he dispendit hadde his good
And ȝif that he encresede were er non
Hise bokis and hise baggis manyon
He leyth beforn hym on his countyg bord
fful ryche was his tresor and his hord
ffor which ful faste his countour dore he schette
And ek he nolde that no man schulde hym lette
Of hise acountis for the mene tyme
And thus he syt tyl it was passid pryme
 Daun Iohn was rysyn in the morwe also
And in the gardyn walkith to and fro
And hath hise thyngis seyd ful curteysly
This goode wyf cam walkynge pryuyly
Into the gardyn there as he walkyth softe
And hym saluyth as he hath doon ofte
A maydechild cam in hyre cumpaynye
Whiche as hyre lyste sche may gouerne and gye
ffor ȝit vndyr the ȝerde was the mayde
 O deere Cosyn myn daun Iohn sche sayde
What aylyth ȝow so rathe for to ryse
Nece quod he it oghte Inogh suffyse
  
ffyue hourys for to slepe vpon a nyght  
But it were for an old appollyd wyght
As been these weddede men that lye and dare
As in a forme sit a very hare
Were al forstrauȝt with houndys greet and smale
But dere nece why be ȝe so pale
I trowe certis that ȝoure goode man
Hath ȝow laboured sythe the nyght began
That ȝow were nede to restyn hastily
And with that word he lough ful meryely
And of his owene thouȝt he wex al red
This fayre wyf gan for to schake hire heed
And seyde thus ȝa god wot al quod she

ffor by þat god þat yave me soule and lyf
In alle þe reme of fraunce ys þere no wyf
þat lasse luste hathe to þat sorie playe
ffor I may syngen alas and weel awaye
þat I was borne but to no wiȝt quod she
Dare I nat telle how that it stant with me
Wherefore I thynke out of this world to wende
Or ellis of myn self to make an ende
So ful am I of drede and of care 
This Monk began vpon this wif to stare
And seyde allas myn nece god forbeede
That ȝe for ony sorwe or ony drede
ffordo ȝoure self but tellyth me ȝoure greef
Parauenture I may in ȝoure myschif
Conseyle or helpe  and therfore tellyth mee
Alle ȝoure anoy for it schal be secree
ffor on myn portoos here I make an oth
That neuere in myn lyue for lef ne loth
Ne schal I of no conseyl ȝow bewreye
The same ageyn to ȝow quod sche I seye
By god and by this portos I ȝow swere
Thow men woldyn me al into pecis tere
  
Ne schal I neuere for to goon to helle
Bewreye a word of thyng that ȝe me telle
Noght for no Cosynage ne allyaunce
But verrayly for loue and affyaunce
Thus been thy swore and here vpon they keste
And eche of hem told othir what hem leste
Cosyn quod sche ȝif that I hadde a space
As I haue non and namely in this place
Thanne wolde I telle a legende of myn lyf  
What I haue suffered sithe that I was a wyf
With myn husbonde al be he youre cosyn
Nay quod this monk by god and seynt martyn
He nys no moore Cosyn vpon to me
Than is the lef that hangyth on the tre
I clepe hym so by seynt denys of fraunce
To han the moore cause of acqueyntaunce
Of ȝow whiche I haue louyd specyally
Abouyn alle wemen sikyrly
This swere I ȝow on myn perfeccioun
Tellyth ȝoure gref lest that he come a doun
And hastyth ȝow and goth awey anon
Myn deere loue quod sche o myn daun Iohn
fful leef were me this conseyl for to hyde
But out it mot it may no moore abyde
 Myn husbonde is to me the worste man
That euere was sithe the world began
But sithe I am a wyf it sit nat me
To telle no wigh of oure pryuyte
Neythir a bedde ne in non othyr place
God schilde I schulde it telle for his grace
A wyf ne schal nat seyn of hyre housbonde
But al honour as I can vndyrstonde
Saue on to ȝow thus tellyn I schal
As helpe me god he nys nat worth an al
In no degre the valeu of a flye
But ȝit me greuyth that most his negarderye
  
And weel ȝe wot that wemen naturelly
Desyryn thyngis gaye as wel as I
They wolde that here husbondys schulde bee
Hardy  and ryche and wys and therto free
And buxsom vnto his wyf and frosch abedde
But by that ilke lord that for vs bledde
ffor his honour mynself for to araye
A sunday next I mot nedys paye
An hunderede frankis or ellys am I lorn
Ȝit weere me leuere that I weere on born
Than me were don a slaundere or velanye  
And ȝif myn husbonde ek myghte it espye

Lene me this summe or ellys mote I deye
Daun Ion I seye lene me these hunderede frankys

And hastily a masse was theere seyd

Myn gold is ȝourys whan that it ȝow leste
And not only myn gold but myn chafare

Of chapmen that here monye is here plogh

Aftyr myn myth ful fayn I wolde ȝow plese
These hunderede frankys he fette forth anoon
And pryuyly he tok hem to daun Iohn
No whyt of al this world wyste of this lone
Sauynge this marchaunt and daun Iohn alone
They drynke and speke and rome a whyle and pleye  
Tyl that daun Iohn rydyth to his abbey

To fflaunderis ward his prentys weel hym gydith
Tyl he cam into Bruggis myriely
Now goth this Marchaunt faste and busyly
Aboute his neede and byeth and creaunceth
He neythir pleyeth at deis ne daunceth
But as a marchaunt schortely for to telle
He lat his lyf and there I lete hym dwelle
The soneday next the marchaunt was agoon
To seynt Denys is come daun Iohn
With croune and berd al frosch and newe schaue
In al the hous ne was so lyte a knawe
Ne no whit ellys that he nas ful fayn

And schortely to the poynt rygh for to goon

Til it was day that daun Iohn wente his way
And bad the meyne fare wel haue good day

And forth he rydyth hom to his abbey
Or wheere hym luste no more of hym I seye

To seynt Denys he gan for to rapayre
And with his wyf he makyth feste and cheere
And tellyth hyre that chaffare is so deere
That nedys muste he make a cheyuyssance

To payen twenty thousent sheeld anon
ffor with this marchaunt is to parys goo
To borwe of certeyn frendys that he hadde
A certeyn frankys and some with hym he ladde
 And whan that he was come in to the toun  
ffor gret chieretee and greet facoun
Vntoo daun Iohn he fyrst goth hym to pleye
Nat for to axe or borwe of hym monye
But for to wete and se of his weel fare
And for to tellyn hym of hys chaffare
As frendys doon whan they been met in feere
Daun Iohn hym makyth feste and myry chieere
And hym tolde ageyn ful specially
How he hadde weel Ibouȝt and graciously

And thanne he schulde ben In Ioye and reste

And she was wonte of olde vsage algate
And alle þat nyȝt in myrthe þei be sette

And pp he gothe and makethe hit wonder towe

And woote ȝe why by god as þat I gesse

Wherefore in lawde as I can beste and may

Of bounte next hir sone of saules bote

And geteste vs þe lyȝt þorouȝe þi prayere
To leden vs vnto þi sone so clere
  
Iy comynge ys to weyke O  blysfull quene
fforto declare þi grete worthynesse

But as a chylde of twelfe moneth of age or lesse
þat can vnneth eny worde expresse
ffor so fare I and þerfore I you pray
Gydeth my songe þat I shalle to you say
There was a Chylde in a grete cite
Amonge crysten folke in þe Iewrye
Susteyned by a lord of þat countre
ffor foule vsurye and lucre of vlanye
þat felle to Cryste and to hys companye
And þorouȝe þe streete men myȝt ryde and wende
ffor hyt was fre and open at eyþere ende
Plyte scoole of crysten folke þere stoode
Doun atte fyrthere ende in whiche þere were
Chyldren an heepe comen of crysten bloode
þat lerned in þat scole yere by ȝeere
Suche manere doctryne as men vsyd þere
Thys ys to say to synge and to rede
As smale Chyldren do in hir Chyldeheede
Amonge þese children was a wydowe sone
A lytel Clerygion seuen yeere of age
þat day by day to scole was hys wone
And also eke where as he saw þe ymage  
Of crystes modere hade he in vsage
As hym was tauȝte to knele adoun and say
hys Aue marie as he goth by þe way
  
Thus hathe þis wydowe hir litel Child tauȝt
Oure blysfull lady Crystes modir dere
To worshipe ay and he foryate hit nouȝt
ffor sely Chylde wylle al day sone lere
But ay when I remembre me of þis matere
Seynt Nicholace stonte euere in my presence
ffor he so yonge to Crist dyd reuerence
Thys Child his lytel booke lernynge
As he sat in þe scole at hys primere

As Children lernyd hir antephonere
As · as he durste he drowe hym nere and nere
And herkened ay þe wordes and þe noote
Tylle he þe fyrste verse coude by roote
Not what þat latyne was to seye
ffor he so yonge and tendre was of age
But on a day hys felawe he gan preye
To expoune hym þis songe in hys langeage
Or tellen hym why þis songe was in vsage
Thus prayde him to construe and declare
ffulle ofte tymes  on his knees bare
Hys felawe whiche was eldere þan he
Answeryd hym þus  þis songe I herde seye
was made of oure blesfulle lady fre
here to salowe and eke hir to preye
To bene oure helpe and our socour whan we deye
I can no more expone in þis matere
I lerne songe I can but lytel gramere
And ys þis songe made in reuerence
Of crystes moder sayd þis Innocent
Now certes I wylle do my diligent
To konne þis or crystemasse be went
  
Thouȝe I for my prymer shalle be shent  
And to be beten þryse on an oure

Hys felawe tauȝte hym hamward pryuely
ffro day to day til he coude yt by roote
And þan he songe it wele and boldely
ffro worde to worde accordynge with þe note
Thrys on a day it passed þorouȝe hys þrote
To scoleward and hamward whan he went
On Crystes modir sett was hys entente
 As I haue sayd þorouȝe oute þe Iewrie
Thys Chylde as he came to and fro
ffulle merely þan wolde he synge and crye
O alma redemptoris mater euere mo
The swetnesse hath hys hert percid so
Of Crystes moder þat to hir to praye
he can not stynte of syngynge by þe weie
Oure fyrste fo the serpent satirnas  
That hath in Ieues herte his waspis nest
Vp swal and seyde O ebraik peple allas
Is this to yow a thyng that is honest
That swich a boy schal walkyn as hym lest
In ȝoure despyt and syngyn of swich centence
Which is aȝens oure lawys reuerence
ffrom thenys forth the Iewys han conspyred
This innocent out of this world to chace
An homycyde thereto han they heryd
Rygh in an aley at a pryue place
And as the child gan forth byfor to pace
This cursede Iew hym hente and held hym faste
And kitte his throte and in a pit hym caste
  
I seye that in a warderope they hym threwe
Where as these Iewys purgyn here entrayle
O cursede folk of herodes al newe
What may ȝoure euele entent ȝow avayle
Mordere wele out certeyn it wele nat fayle
And namely there as thonour of god schal sprede
The blod out cryeth on youre cursede dede
O martyr soudede to virginite

Of whiche the greete euangelyst seynt Iohn
In pathmos wrot  which seyth that they that gon

With face pale of drede and busy thouȝt

With moderis pite in hire brest enclosed  
Sche goth as sche were half out of hire mynde
To eueriplace where as sche hath supposid

And euere on crystis modyr meke and kynde

Among the cursede Iewys sche hym soughte
Sche askyth and sche fraynyth pitously
Of euery Iue that dwelte in thilke place
To telle hire of hire child wente out forth by

That in that place aftyr hire sone sche cryede
Where he was casten in a pit besyde
O greete god that parfornedist this laude
By mouth of innocentis lo here thyn myght

And ek of martyredom the rubye bryȝt
There he with throte Ikorvyn lygh vp ryght

So loude that al the place gan to rynge

In comyn for to wonderyn vpon this thyng
And hastyliche they for the prouost sente

And heryeth Crist that is of heuene kyng
And his modyr honour of mankynde
And aftyr that the Iewis leet he bynde

And with honour of greet processyoun

With turnement and with schameful deth echon  
This prouost doth these Iewis for to sterue

Therefore with wilde hors he dede hem drawe
And aftyr that he hyng hem by the lawe
  
Vpon this beere lyth ay this Innocent
Byfore the highe auteer whil the masse laste
And aftyr that the albot with his couent

And whan they holy watyr on hem caste

And song  O alma redemptoris mater

As monkys been or ellis oughten bee

And seyde o deere child I halse the

Approchith neer and loke vp myryely
Now ware ȝow seris and lat this man haue place

But of a rȳm I lernede longe agoon
Ȝe that is good quod he now schul we here
Sum deynte thyng me thynkyth by hise cheere


lTl Estyth lordyngis in good entent
And I wele telle verrayment
Of myrthe and solas
And of a knyght was fayr and gent
In batayle and in turnement
His name was sere Thopas
Iborn he was in fer cuntre
In flaunderis al beȝounde þe see
At poperyng in the place
His fadir was a man ful fre
And lord he was of that cuntre
As it was godis grace
Syre Thopas wex a doghty sweyn
Whit was hise face as payn demayn
Hise lippis rede as rose
His rode is lyk skarlet engrayn
As I ȝow telle in good certayn
He hade a semely nose
His heer his berd was lik saferon  
That to his gerdil raughte adoun
Hise schon of cordewayne
Of brugis were hire hosyn broun
His robe was of siklatoun
That coste manye a Iayne
  
He coude hunte at wilde deer
And ryde on hauking for ryueer
With grey goshauk and hunde
Therto he was a good archier
Of wrastelyng was theere non his pir
Theere ony ram schal stonde
fful manye a maydyn brygh in bour
They mornede for hym paramour
whan hem were bet to slepe
But he was chast and no lechour
And sweete as is the brymbil flour
that beryth the rede hepe
And so it fil vpon a day
fforsothe as I ȝow telle may
Sire Thopas wolde out ryde
He worthith vpon hise stede bay
And in his hand a launcegay
A long swerd by his syde
He prykyth thorw a fayr forest
Therein is manye a wylde best
ye bothe bukkys and hare
And as he prykyth north and est
I telle it ȝow hym hadde almest
Bytid a sory care
Theere spryngyn erbis grete and smale
The lycorys and the Cetewale
And manye a clowe Ielofere
And notemuge to putte in ale
Whethir it be moyst or stale
Or for to leye in cofere
  
The bryddys synge it is non nay
The sperhauk and the popyniay
That Ioye it was to heere
The thrustilcok made ek his lay
The wode douwe vpon the spray
sche song ful loude and cleere
Sire Thopas fil in loue longynge
Al whan he herde the thrustil synge
And prikede as he were wod
Hise fayre stede in hise prykynge
So swatte that men myȝte hym wrynge
Hise sydys were al blod
Sere topas ek so wery was
ffor prykynge on the softe gras
So fiers was hise corage
That doun he leyde hym in the plas
To makyn his stede sum solas
And ȝaf hym good forage
O seynte marye benedicite
What eylyth this loue at me
To bynde me so soore
Me dremede al this nyght parde  
An Elf queene schal myn leman be
And slepe vndyr myn goore
An Elf queene wele I haue Iwis
ffor in this world no woman is
Worthi to ben myn make
In tounne
Alle othere women I forsake
And to an elf queene I me betake
by dale and ek by doūne
  
Into his sadyl he clomb anon
And prykyth ouyr style and ton
An elf queen for tespye
Til he so longe hath rydyn and goon
That he fond in a pryue woon
The cūntre of fayrye
So wilde
for in that cuntree was there non
    
Neythir wif ne childe
Til that theere cam a greet geaunt
His name was sire olyfaunt
A parlious man of dede
He seyde child by termagaunt
But ȝif thow pryke out of myn haunt
Anon I sle thyn steede
With Mace
Here is this queen of fayrye
With harpe and pype and Symphonye
Dwellynge in this place
The child seyde also mote I the
To morwe wele I meete the
Whan I haue myn armoure
And ȝit I hope parmafay
That thow schat with thyn launcegay
Abyen it ful soure
Thy mawe
Thyn hauberk schal I persen if I may
Er it be fully pryme of the day
ffor heere schalt thow been slawe
  
Syre Thopas drow abok ful faste
This Ieaunt at hym stonys caste
Out of a fel staf slynge
But fayre eschapith sire thopas
And al was thour godys gras
And thour his fayre berynge
Yit lestyth lordyngis to myn tale
Muryere than the nyghtyngale
I wele ȝow roune
How sire Thopas with sydis smale
Prykynge ouyr hil and dale
Is comyn ageyn to toūne
Hise merye men comaundede hee
To make hym bothe gamyn and glee
for nedys muste he fyghte
With a geaunt with hedis thre
ffor paramour and Iolyte
Of oon that schon ful bryȝt
Do come he seyde myne mynstralis
And Gestourys for to tellyn talys
Anon in myn armyng
Of romauncis that been royalis  
Of popis and of Cardenalys
And ek of loue lykynge
They fette hym fyrst swete wyn
And mede ek in a Mahelyn
And royal spicerye
Of gynge breed that was ful fyn
And lychorys and ek comyn
With sugere that is trye
  
He dede next his white lere
Of cloth of lake fyn and cleere
A brech and ek a scherte
And next his schirte an aketoun
And ouyr that an habyrioun
for persynge of his herte
And ouyr that a fyn hauberk
Was al Iwrouȝt of Iewys werk
ful stronge it was of plate
And ouyr that his coote armour
As whit as is a lylye flour
In whiche he wolde debate
Hese shild was al of gold so red
And there in was a borys hed
A Charbokele by his syde
And there he swor on ale and breed
How that the Ieaunt schulde be deed
Bytyde what betyde
Hise Iambieux were of quyrboyly
His swerdys schede of yuory
Hise helm of latoun bryȝt
His sadil was of rewel boon
His brydyl as the sunne It schon
Or as the moone lyght
Hise spere was of fyn cipres
That biddyth werre and no thyng pees
The hed ful scharpe Igrounde
Hise steede was of dapil gray
It goth an ambil in the way

In londe
Lo lordyngis myne here is a fyt
If ȝe wele ony moore of it
To telle it wele I fonde
Now holdyth ȝoure mouth for charyte
bothe knygh and lady free
And herkenyth to myn spelle
Of batayle and of chyualry
And of ladyis loue drewery
Anoon I wele ȝow telle
Men spekyn of romauncis of prys
Of hornchild and of Ipotys
Of Beevis and sire Gy
Of sire lybeus and playndamour
But sire Thopas beryth the flour
Of royal chyualry
His goode stede al he bestrod
And forth vpon his weye he glod
As sparkele out of bronde

And ther yn stiked a lilye flour
God schilde his cors fro schonde
 And for he was knyght Auntrous
He ne slepte in non hous
But logged in his hood
His bright helme was his wonger
And bi hym baited his dester
Of herbis fyn and good
  
 Hym self drank water of the welle
As dide the knyght sir Percyuelle
So worthely vnder wede
Till it was on a daye
NO more of this for goddes dignite
Quod oure oost for þou makest me
So wery of þin lewdenes
That also wisly god me bles
Myn eres ake of thi darsty speche
Now suche a ryme þe deuel I beteche
This may be wel ryme dogerell quod he
Whi so quod I why wilt þou lette me
More of my tale than an other man
Sethyns it is þe beste ryme I can
By god quod he pleynly I the say
Thou shalt no lenger rymen here to day
Thow dost noght elles but dyspendest tyme
Sire oo word þou shalt no lenger ryme
Let see wheþer þou canst telle ought in geste
Or telle in prose somwhat at þe leste
In whiche þer be somme merthe and som doctrine
Gladly quod I by goddes swete pyne
I wil ȝou telle a litel thing in prose
That oughte lyke ȝou as I suppose
Other elles certes ȝe ben to daungerous
Hit is a moral tale vertuous
Al be hit tolde somtyme in sundry wyse
Of sondry folk as I shal ȝou deuyse
As þus ȝe wote wel euery euaungeliste
þat telleth vs of Ihesu Crist
Ne saith not al þing as his felawe doth
But natheles her sentence is al soth
And alle accorden as in her sentence
Al be ther in her tellynge difference
  
for some of hem seyn more and somme seyn lesse
when þey his pitous passion expresse
I mene of Marc Matheu Luke and Iohn
But douteles her sentence is al on  
þerfore lordynges alle  ȝou beseche
Ȝif þat ȝe þinke I varye in my speche
As þus ȝif þat I telle somwhat more
Of prouerbes þen ȝe haue herd byfore
Comprehendid in þis litel tretys here
To enforce with þe effecte of my matere
And þoughe I nadde þe same wordes saye
As ȝe han herd ȝit to alle ȝou I praye
Blameth me not for as in myn sentence
ȝe schal not fynden moche difference
ffro þe sentence of þe tretys lyte
After þe whiche þis mery tale I wryte
And herkeneth what I schal seye
And lete me telle my tale I preye
Whan endid was þis tale of Melybe
And of  Prudence and of hir benygnyte
Oure hoste sayd as I am a · feythfull man
And by þe preciouse corpus madryan
I hade leuere þan a Barelle of ale
þat godeleve my wyf hade hard þis tale
ffor she nys no þenge of suche pacience ·
As was þis Melibeus wyfes prudence
Be godes bones whan I bete my knaues
Sche bryngeth me þe grete clubbed staves
And cryethe slee þe dogges euereycheon
And breke bothe backe and bone
And ȝif þat ony neghebour of myne
Wolle not in chirche to my wyf enclyne
Or be so hardy to her to trespace
When she cometh home she renneth in my face
And cryeth false coward wreke þi wyfe
By corpus bonus I wylle haue þi knyfe
And þou shalte haue my distafe and go spynne
ffro day to nyȝt riȝt þus she wolle begynne
Alas she seithe þat euere I was shape
To wedde a melke soppe or so grete an ape
þat wolle bene ouere lade with euery wyȝt
þou dorste not stonde by þi wyf a ryȝt
Thys ys my lyfe but ȝif I wolde fyȝt
And oute at þe dore anone I mote me dyȝt
Or elles I am lost but ȝif þat I
Be lyke a wylde lyonn foule hardy
I wote wele she wylle do me slee som day  
Some neyȝeboure and þan go my way
For I am perlious with knyf in honde  
Al be it that I dar nat hire withstonde
  
For sche is big in armys by myn feyth
That schal he fynde that hire mys doth or seyth
But lat vs passe away from this matiere
Myn lord the Monk be merye of cheere
For ȝe schul telle a tale trewely
Lo rouchestre stant heere faste by
Ryde forth myn owene lord  brek nat oure game
But by myn trouthe I knowe nat ȝoure name
Wher schal I calle ȝow myn lord daund Iohn
Or daun Thomas or ellis daun Albon
Of what hous be ȝe by ȝoure fadyr kyn
I voue to god thow hast a ful fayr skyn
It is a gentyl pasture theere thow gost
Thow art nat lyk a penaunt or a gost
Vpon myn feyth thow art sum offyseer
Sum worthi Sexteyn or sum Celereer
ffor by myn fadyr soule as to myn doom
Thow art a maystyr whan thow art at hom
No poore Cloysterer ne non nouys
But a gouernour worthy and wis
And therwithal of braun and of bonys
A weel farynge persone for the nonys
I preye to god ȝeue hem confusioun
That ferst the brouȝte vnto relygeoun
Thow woldyst a been a tredefowel aryȝt
Haddyst thow as greet a leue as thow hast myght
To perforne al this lust in engendernge
Thow haddyst begetyn manye a creature
Allas why werys thow so syd a cope
God ȝeue me sorwe but and I were a pope
Nat only thow but euery myghty man
Thow he were schore hye vp on his pan
Schulde han a wif for al the world is lorn
Religeous hath takyn vp al the corn
Of tythyng  and we borel meen been schrympis  
Of feble treis theere comyn febele ympis
  
This makyth that oure eyris been so sklendere
And feble that they may not weel engendere
This makyth that oure wiuys wele assaye
Relygeous folk for ȝe mowe the betere paye
Of Venus payementis than mowe we
God wot no lusschebruys paye ȝe
But be nat wroth myn lord thow that I pleye
Ful ofte in game a sothe I haue herd seye
THis worthy Monk tok al in pacience
And seyde I wele don al myn diligence
As fer as sounyth into honeste
To telle ȝow a tale or two or three
And ȝif thow leste to herkyn hedyrward
I wele ȝow seyn the lyf of seynt Edeward
Or ellis fyrst tragedeis wele I telle
Of whiche I haue an hundered in myn celle
Tragedie is to seyne a certeyn storye
As olde bokys makyn vs memorie
Of hym that stod in greet prosperitee
and is Ifallyn out of hygh degre
Into myserye and endyth wrechedely
And they been vercified comounly
Of sexe feet whiche men callyn exametroun
In prose ek endytid been many on
And ek in metre in manye a sundery wyse
Lo this declarynge oughte Inough suffyse
Now herkyth ȝif ȝow lyke for to heere
But fyrst I ȝow beseke in this matiere
Thow I be ordere telle nat these thyngis
Be it of popis emperourys or kyngis
Aftyr here agis as men rede and fynde
But telle hem some byfore and some behynde
As it comyth to myn remembraunce
Haue me excusede of myn ygnoraunce

I Wole bewayle in manere of Tragedie
The harm of hem that stood in hey degre
And fellyn so that theere nas no remedie
To brynge hem out of here aduercitee
For certeyn whan that fortune leste to fle
Theere may no man the cours of hire withholde
Lat not man truste on blynd prosperitee
Bywar by these exsaumplys trewe and olde
At lucyfer thow he an aungel weere
And not a man at hym I wele begynne
For thow fortune may noon aungel deere
From high degre ȝit fel he for his synne
Doun into helle where as he ȝit is inne
O lucifer bryȝteste  of aungellis alle
Now art thow satenas that mayst not twynne
Out of myserie  in which that thow art falle
Loo Adam in the feeld of damassene
With goddys owene fyngyr mad was hee
And not begetyn of manys sperme onclene
And welte al paradys sauynge on tree
Hadde neuere wordely man so heigh degree
As adam tyl he for mysgouernaunce
Was dreue out of his hye prosperite
To labour and to helle and to myschaunce

Loo Sampson that was annunciat  
By aungel longe er his natyuite
And was to god almyghty consecrat
And stood in noblesse whil he myȝte see
Was neuere swich anothir as was hee
To speke of strenthe and therwyth hardynesse
But to hise wiuys tolde he his secree
Thorw whiche he slow hym self for wrechedenesse
Sampson this noble almyghty champioun
Withoutyn wepene saue hise handis tweye
He slow and al torente the lyoun
Toward his weddyng walkynge by the weye
His false wif coude hym so pleese and preye
Til sche his conseyl knew and sche vntrewe
Vnto hise fois his conseyl gan bewreye
And hym forsok and tok anothir newe
Thre hunderede foxis tok Sampson for yre
And alle here taylys he togedere bond
And sette the foxis taylys alle on feere
For he on euery tayl hadde knyt a brond
And they brende alle the corn in that lond
On alle hire Oliueis and vinys ek
A thousent men ek slow he with his hond
And hadde non wepene but an assis cheeke
Whan they were slayn so trustede hym that he
Was wol nygh lorn for which he gan to preye
That god wolde on his peyne han sum pete
And sende hym drynk  or ellis muste he deye
And of this Assis cheke that was dreye
Owt of a wange tooth  sprong anoon a welle
Of whiche he drank Inough schortely to seye
Thus helpede hym god as Iudicum can telle
  
By verray force at a Gaȝan on a nyght
Maugere philistienys of that Citee
The ȝatis of the toun he hath vp plyȝt  
And on his bak Ikaryede hem hath hee
Hye on an hil wheere as men myȝte hym se
O noble almyghty Sampson leue and deere
Haddist thow nat told to women thyn secre
In al this world ne hadde be thyn peere
This Sampson neythir Sythir drank ne wyn
Nor on his heed cam rasor non ne scheere
By precept of the massangeer deuyn 
For alle hise strenthis in hise heris weere
And fully twenty wyntyr ȝeer be ȝeere
He hadde of Israel the gouernaunce
But soone schal he wepe ful manye a teere
For women schal hym brynge to myschaunce
Vnto his leman Dalida he tolde
That in hise heris al hise strenthe lay
And falsely to hise fomen sche hym solde
And slepynge vp in hire barm vpon a day
Sche maade to clippe or schere his heer away
And made his fomen his craft espyen
And whan that they hym fond in this aray
They boundyn hym faste and puttyn out hise eyen
But er his heed  was clyppid or Ischaue
Theere was no bond mygh hym bynde
But now is he  in prisoun in a Caue
Wheere as they made  hym at the querne to grynde
O noble Sampson  strongeste of man kynde
O whilom Iuge  in glorye and in rychesse
Now mayst thow wepyn  with thynne eyen blynde
Sythe thow from wele  art fallyn in wrechedenesse
  
The ende of this caytyf was as I schal seye
Hise fomen made  a feste vpon a day
And made hym as a fool  byfore hem pleye
And this was in a temple  of greet aray
But at the laste he maade a foul affray  
For he two pilleris schok  and made hem falle
And doun fil temple and al there it lay
And slow hym self and ek hise fomen alle
This is to seyne the pryncis euerychon
And ek thre hunderede bodyis weere theere slayn
With fallynge of the greete temple of stoon
Of Sampsoun wele I no moore seyn
Beth war bi this 1exsaummple olde and pleyn1
That no man telle here conseyl to here wyuys
Of swich thyng as they wele haue secre fayn
If that it touche  hire  lymys or hire lyuys
Of Hercules the souereyn conquerour
Syngyn his laude his werkis and his renoun
For in his tyme of strenthe he was the flour
He slow and rafte the skyn from the lyoun
He of Centauros leyde the beste adoun
He arpijs slow the crewel briddys felle
He goldene appillis  rafte of the dragoun
He drow out Cerberus out of helle
He slow the crewel tyraunt Busirus
And made his hors to frete hym flesch and boon
He slow the fery serpent venymous
Of Achilois hornys 3too  he brak on3
And he slow Cakus in a Caue of stoon
He slow the geaunt Antheus the stronge
He slow the gresely boor and that anoon
And bar the heed vpon his spere longe
  
Was neuere wight swich sithe that this world began
That slow so manye monstris as dede he
Thourw out this wide world his name ran
What for his strenthe and for his hye bounte
And euery reume wente he for to se
He was so strong that no man myghte hym lette
At boothe the wordys endis seyth trophee  
Instede of boundis  he a piller sette
A lemman hadde this noble Champioun
That highte dianira  frosch as may
And as these clerkis makyn mencyoun
Sche hath hym sent a scherte frosch and gay
Allas this scherte allas and weyleaway
Enuenymyd was so subtyl with alle
That er that he hadde wered it half a day
It made his flesch al from hise bonys falle
But natheles summe clerkis hire excusyn
By on that hyghte Nessius that it makid
Be as be may I wele hire not excusyn
But on his bak this scherte he werede al nakid
Til that the scherte was for the venym blakid
And whan he saw noon othir remedye
In hoote colys he hath hym self Irakyd
For with no venym deynede hym to deye
Thus starf this myghti Hercules
Lo ho may truste on fortune ony throwe
ffor hym that folwith al this world of prees
Er he be war is ofte Ileyd ful lowe
fful wis Is he that can hym seluyn knowe
Beeth war for whanne that fortune leste to glose
Thanne waytith sche hire man to ouerthrowe
By swich a weye as he wolde lest suppoose

 The myȝty trone the precious tresor
The gloriouse Ceptre and royal mageste
That hadde the kyng Nabegodonosor
With tunge onethe may discryuede be
He twijs wan Ierusalem Cete
The vessel of the temple he with hym ladde
At babiloine was his souereyn see
In whiche his glorye and his delyt he ladde
The fayreste childeryn of the blod royal  
Of Israel he leet do gilde anoon
And makede eche of hem to been his thral
Amongis othere Danyel was oon
That was the wiseste child of euerichon
For he the dremys of the child expoungnede
Whereas in chaldeye clerk was theere noon
That wiste to what fyn hise dremys sounede
The proude kyng leet make a statute of gold
Syxti Cubitis longe and seuene in breede
To whiche ymage he bothe ȝonge and olde
Comaunded to loute and haue in dreede
Or in a furneys ful of flaumbis reede
He schal been brend that wolde not obeye
But neuere wolde assente to that deede
Danyel ne hise ȝonge felawys tweye
This kyng of kyngis proud was and elayt
He wende that god that sit in Mageste
Ne myghte hym not byreue of his estat
And sodeynly he loste his dygnetee
And lik a beste hym semede for to bee
And eet hey as an oxe and lay there oute
In reyn with wilde bestis walkede he
Tyl certeyn tyme was Icomyn aboute
  
And lyk an egellis federis wexsyn his erys
Hise naylis lyk a briddis clawis weere
Til god relesede hym a certeyn ȝerys
And ȝaf hym wit and thanne with manye a teere
He thankede god and euere his lyf in feere
Was he to doon amys or moore trespace
And tyl that tyme  he leyd was on his beere
He knew that god was ful of myȝt and graace
His sone which that hyȝte Balthasar
That held the regne aftyr hire fadyris day
He by his fader coude not be war  
ffor proud he was of herte and of aray
And ek an ydolastre was he ay
Hise hye estat assurede hym in pryde
But fortune caste hym doun and there he lay
And sodeynly his regne he gan deuyde
A feste he made vnto hise lordis alle
Vpon a day and bad hem blythe bee
And thanne hise offiseris gan he calle
Goth bryngith forth the vessell quod he
Which that myn fadyr in his prosperite
Out of the temple of 1Ierusalem1 berafte
And to oure hye goddis thanke we
Of honour that oure olderis with vs lafte
His wif hise lordis and hise concubynys
Ay dronkyn whil here apetitis laste
Out of these noble vessellis sundery wynys
And on a wal this kyng his eyen caste
And saw an hand armles that wrot ful faste
ffor 1feere1 of whiche he quok and sykede soore
This hand that balthasar so soore agaste
Wroot Mane 1techel1 phares and na moore
  
In al that land magicien was non
That coude expoungne what these letterys mente
But danyel expoungnede it anoon
And seyde kyng god to thyn fadyr sente
Glorie and honour  regne tresor rente
And he was proud  and no thyng god ne dradde
And therfore god greet 1wreche1 on hym sente
And hym berafte  the regne that he hadde
He was out cast of manny cumpaynye
With assis was his habytacioun
And eet hay as a beste  in weet and drye
Tyl that he knew by grace and by resoun
That god of heuene hath domynacioun  
Of euery regne  and euery creature
And thanne hadde god of hym compascioun
And hym restorede his regne and his figure
Ek thow that art his sone art proud also
And knowist alle these sygnys verrayly
And art rebel to god and art his foo
Thow drank ek of hise wellys boldely
Thyn wyf ek and thynne wenchis synfully
Dronke of the same vessel sundery wynys
And heryist false goddis cursedely
Therfore to the Ischapyn ful greet pyne is
This hand was sent from god that on the wal
Wroot mane techel phares trust to me
Thyn regne is doon thow weyest noght at al
Deuidit is thyn regne  and it schal bee
To Medes and to perses ȝeuyn quod he
And tilke same nyȝt this kyng was slawe
And Daryus ocupied his degree
Thow he thereto hadde neythir ryȝt ne lawe
  
Lordyngis ensaumple hereby may ȝe take
How that in lordschepe is no sekyrnesse
For whan fortune wele a man forsake
Sche beryth awey his regne and hys rychesse
And ek hise frendis bothe moore and lasse
For what that hath frendis thourr fortune
Mishap wele make hem enemyis I gesse
This prouerbe is ful soth and ful comune
 Cenobia of palimerye queene
As wrytyn percyens of hire noblesse
So worthi was in armys and so keene
That no whit passede hire in hardynesse
Ne in lynage nor othir gentillesse
Of kyngis blod of perse is sche dessendid
I seye that sche hadde not mooste fayrenesse  
But of hire schap sche myȝte nat been amendid
From hire childhod  I fynde that sche fledde
Offise of wemen and to wode sche wente
And manye a wylde hertis blood sche schedde
With arwis broode that sche to hym sente
Sche was so swift that sche anoon hem hente
And whan that sche was eldere sche wolde kylle
Leonys lebardis and beris al torente
And in hire armys wilde hem at hire wille
Sche durste wilde beestis denys seeke
And rennyn in the mounteigny al be nyght
And slepyn vndyr the busch  and sche coude ek
Wrastellyn by verray forse and verray myght
With any ȝong man were he neuere so wight
There myghte no thyng in hire armys stonde
Sche kepte hire maydynheed from euery wyght
To no man degnede hire for to been bonde
  
But at the laste hire frendys haddyn hire maryed
To onedake a prynce of that cuntree
Al weere it so that sche hem longe taryed
And ȝe schal vndyrstonde how that he
Hadde swiche fantasyis as hadde sche
But nathelees whan they weere knyt in feere
They leuede in Ioye and in felycite
For eche of hem hadde othir leef and deere
Saue on thyng that sche wolde neuere assente
By no wey that he schulde by hire lye
But ones for it was hire pleyn entente
To haue a child the world to multyplye
And also sone as sche myghe espye
That sche was nat with childe with that deede
Thanne wolde sche suffere hym don his fantasye
Eft sonys and not but onys out of dreede
And If sche were with childe at tylke cast  
Namore schulde he pleyen tylke game
Tyl fynally fourty dayis weere past
Thanne wolde sche onys suffere hym the same
Al weere this Onedake wilde or tame
He gat na moore of hire for thus sche sayde
It was to wyuys lecherye and schame
In othir cas ȝif men with hem playede
Two sonys bi this Onedake hadde sche
The whiche sche kepte  in vertu and lettyrure
But now vnto oure tale turne we
I seye so worschepeful a criature
And wis therewith and large with mesure
So peynyble in the werre and curteys ek
Ne moore labour myghte in werre endure
Was noon thow al this world men schulde seeke
  
Hyre ryche aray myghte not be told
As wel in vessel as in hyre clothynge
Sche was al clad in perre and in golde
And ek sche lafte not for noon huntynge
To haue of sundery tungis ful knowynge
Whan that sche leyseer hadde  and for to entende
To lerne bokys was hire lykynge
How sche myghte in wertu hire lyf dyspende
And schortely of this story for to trete
So doughty was hire husbonde and ek sche
That they conquerede manye regnys greete
In the oryent with manye a fayr cete
Apertenaunt vnto the mageste
Of rome and with strong hand held hem faste
Ne neuere myghte hire fomen don hem fle
Ay whil 1that Onadakys dayis laste1
Hyre bataylis who so lyste hem for to reede
Agayn soper the kyng and othere moo
And how that al this proces fyl in deede  
Why sche conquerede and what tytle therto
And aftyr of hire myschif and hire wo
Hov that sche was besegit and Itake
Let hym vnto myn maystir Petraik go
That writ Inough of this I vndyrtake
Whan Onedake was deed sche myghtyly
The regnys held and with hire propre hond
Agayns hire fois sche faught so crewelly
That theere nas kyng nor prynce in al that lond
That he nas glad ȝif he that grace fond
That sche ne wolde vpon his lond werreye
With hire they made allyaunce by bond
To been in pees and leete hire ryde and pleye
  
The Emperour of rome Claudius
Ne hym beforn the Romen Galyeen
Ne durste neuere been so corageous
Ne noon Ermyn ne non Egipcien
Ne Surreyn ne non Arabieen
Withinne the feeldys that durste with hire fyȝt
Lest that sche wolde hem wit hire handis sleen
Or with hire meyne puttyn hem to flyght
In kyngis habite wente hire sonys two
As heyris of hire faderys regnes alle
And hermanno  and thimalao
Hire namys were as persiens hem calle
But ay fortune hath in hire hony galle
This myghty queen may no while endure
Fortune out of hire regne  made hire falle
To wrechedenesse and to mysauenture
Aurelyan whan that the gouernaunce
Of Rome cam Into hire handis tweye
He schop vpon his queen to doon vengeaunce
And with hise legiounnys he tok his weye
Toward Senobie and schortely for to seye  
He made hire fle  and at the laste hire hente
And feterede hire and ek hire chyldere tweye
And wan the lond and hom to rome he wente
Amongis othere thyngis that he wan
Hire chaar that was with gold wrought and perre
This greete roman this aurelian
Hath with hym lad for that men schulde it se
Byforn his triumphe walkyth sche
With gilte cheynys 1vpon here nekke hangynge1
Corounede was sche as aftyr hyre degree
And ful of perre chargit hire clothynge
    
Allas fortune sche that whilom was
Dredeful to kyngis and to emperourys
Now gauryth al the peple on hire allas
And sche that helmede was in starke stourys
And wan by force tounnys stronge and tourvs
Schal on hire heed now were a vitremyte
And sche that bar the Ceptre ful of flour
Schal bere a distaf hire cost forto quyte
Althow that Nero were vicious
As ony feend that lyth ful lowe adoun
Ȝit as tellyth vs Switonyus
This wide world hadde in subieccioun
Bothe est and west  North and Septemptrioun
Of Rubees Safferys  and of perlys whyte
Weere alle hise clothis broudede vp and doun
For he in gemmys gretly gan delyte
More delicat  more pompous of aray
Moore proud was neuere emperour than hee
That ilke cloth that he hadde wered a day
Aftyr that tyme he wolde it neuere se
Nettis of gold thred hadde he greet plente
To fysche in tibre whan hym lyste to pleye
His lustis were alle lawe in his decree  
For fortune as his frend  hym wolde obeye
He Rome brende for his delicasie
The Senatouris he slow vpon a day
To heere how that men schulde weepe and crye
And slow his brothir and by his sistyr lay
His modyr made he in pytous array
ffor he hyre wombe slytte to byholde
Wheere he conseyuede was so weyleawey
That he so lytyl of his modyr tolde
    
No teer out of hise eyen for that syght
Ne cam but seyde a fayr woman was sche
Greet wondyr is how that he coude or myghte
Be domysman of hire deede beaute
The wyn to bryngyn hym comaundede he
And drank anoon  non othyr wo he made
Whan myght is Ioyned on to creweltee
Allas to deepe wil the venym wade
In ȝouthe a maystyr hadde this Emperour
To teche hym letterure and curteysye
For of moralite he was the floure
As in his tyme but ȝif bokis lye
And whil this Maystyr hadde of hym maystrye
He makede hym so cunning and so souple
That long tyme it was er tyranye
Or ony vice durste on hym oncouple
This Seneca  of which that I deuyse
By cause that Nero hadde of hym swich dreede
For he from vicis wolde hym ay chastyse
Discretly by word and not by deede
Syre wolde he seyn an emperour mot neede
Been vertyuous and hatyn tyrannye
For which he in a bath made hym to bleede
On bothe hise armys tyl he muste deye
This Nero hadde ek of a custumance  
In ȝouthe ageyn his maystyr for to ryse
Which aftyrward hym thoughte a greet greuaunce
Therfore he made hym deye in this wyse
But natheles this Seneca the wise
Ches in a bath to deye in this 2manere2
Rathere than han anothir 3turmantrise3
And thus hath Nero slayn his maystir deere
    
Now fil it so that fortune leste no lengere
The hyghe pryde of nero to cheryce
For thow that he were strong ȝit was sche strengere
Sche thouȝte thus bi god I am to nyce
To sette a man that is fulfyld of vice
In high degre and emperour hym calle
By god out of his seete I wele hym tryce
Whan he lest wenyth  sonest schal he falle
The peple ros vp on hym on a nygh
For his defaute and whan he it espyed
Out of his doris he hath anon hym dygh
Aloone and theere he wende a been alyed
He knokkede faste and ay the more he cryede
The fastere schettyn they the dorys alle
Tho wiste he weel he hadde hym self mys gyede
And wente his wey no lengere durste he calle
The peple cryede  and rumblede vp and doun
That with hise eris herde he how they seyde
Wheere is this false tyraunt this neroun
For fer almost out of his wit he broyde
And to hise goddis pitously he preyede
For socour but it myghte not betyde
For dreed of this hym thoughte he deyede
And ran into a gardyn hym to hyde
And in this gardyn fond he cherlys tweye
That seetyn by a fyr  greet and reed
And to these cherlys two he gan to preye  
To sleen hym and to gyrdyn of his heed
That to his body whan that he was deed
Weere no dispyt doon  for his defame
Hym selue he slow be coude no betere red
Of whiche fortune lough and hadde game

 Was neuere a capitayn vndyr a kyng
That regnys mo pute in subieccioun
Ne strongere was in feeld of alle thyng
As in his tyme ne grettere of renoun
Ne moore pompous in high presumpcioun
Than oloferne whiche fortune ay kyste
So licorously and ladde hym vp and doun
Til that his hed was of or that he wyste
Nat only that this world hadde hym in awe
For lesynge of rychesse or liberte
But made euery man reneye his lawe
Nabugodonosor was god seyde hee
Noon othir god schulde adowred bee
Ageyn this heste no whigh dar trespace
Saue in Bethulia a strong cete
Where Eliachym a prest was of that place
But tak keep of the deth of Oloferne
Amydde his ost  he dronke lay a nyght
Withinne his tente  as large as is a berne
And ȝit for al his pompe and al his myght
Iudith a woman as he lay vpright
Slepynge his heed of smot  and from his tente
Ful priuyly sche stal from euery wight
And with his heed  vnto hire towr sche wente
What nedyth it of kyng antiochus
To telle his hyghe royal magestee
His hyghe pride hise werkys venymous
For swich anothyr was theere non as he
Reede which that he was in machabee  
And reede the proude wordis that he seyde
And whi he fyl from high prosperite
And in an hil how wrechedely he deyede
    
Fortune hadde hym enchauntede so in pride
That verrayly he wende he myghte attayne
Onto the sterris vpon euery syde
And in a balaunce weyn eche mountayne
And alle the flodys of the see restrayne
And goddis peple hadde he most in hate
Hem wolde he slen in turnement and in peyne
Wenynge that god ne myghte his pride abate
And for that nychanore and thymothee
With Iewis were venquischid myghtily
Vnto the Iewis swich an hate hadde he
That he bad ordeyne his char ful hastily
And swoor and seyde ful dispitously
Vnto Ierusalem he wolde eft soone
To wreeke his yre on it ful crewelly
But of his purpos he was let ful soone
God for his manace hym so soore smot
With inuisible wounde ay incurable
That in hise guttis carveit so and bot
That hise peynys were Importable
And certeynly the wreche was resonable
For manye a manys guttis dede he peyne
But from his purpos cursede and dampnable
For al his smert he wolde hym nat restrayne
But bad anoon aparaylyn his host
And sodeynly er he was of it war
God dauntede al his pryde and al his bost
For he so sore fil out of his Chaar
That 2it hese2 lymys and his skyn totar
So that he neythir myghte go ne ryde
But in a chaar men aboute hym bar  
Al forbrosed bothe bak and syde
    
The wreche of god hym smoot so crewelly
That thurgh his body wikkede wermys crepte
And therwythal he stank so horybely
That noon of al his meyne that hym kepte
Whethir so he awok or ellis sleepte
Ne myghte not the stynk of hym endure
In this myschef he waylede and ek wepte
And knew god lord of euery cryature
To al his host and to hym self also
Ful wlatsom was the stynk of his carayne
No man myghte hym beryn to ne fro
And in this stynk and in this horible peyne
He starf ful wrechedely in a mounteyne
Thus hath this robbour and this homycyde
That manye a man made to weepe and pleyne
Swich gwerdoun as bylongith onto pryde
 The storye of alysaundir is so comune
That euery wight that hath discrecioun
Hath herd al or sumwhat of his fortune
This wyde world as in conclusioun
He wan by strenthe  and for his highe renoun
They weere glad for pees vnto hym sende
The pride of man and beste he leyde adoun
Wheere so he cam vnto the worldis ende
Comparisoun myghte neuere ȝit been makyd
Bytwixen hym and anothir conquerour
For al this world for dreed of hym hath quakyd
He of knyghthod and of fredom flour
Fortune hym made the heyere of hire honour
Save wyn and wemen no thyng myȝte aswage
His hye entente in armys and labour
So ful he was of lyonyn corage
    
What preys weere it for hym thow that I tolde  
Of daryus and an hunderede thousent mo
Of Kyngis Dukis Erlys pryncis bolde
Whiche he conquerede and broughte into woo
I seye as fer as men may ryde or go
The world was his what schulde I moore deuyse
For thow I wryte or tolde ȝow euere mo
Of his knyghthod it myghte not suffyse
Twelue ȝeer he regnede  as seyth Machabee
Philippis sone of Macidonye he was
That fyrst was kyng of grece the cuntre
O worthi gentile Alisaundere allas
That euere schulde fallyn swich a cas
Enpoisounnede of thynne owene folk thow weere
Thyn sys fortune hath turnede into aas
And for the ne wepe sche neuere a teere
Who schal me ȝeuyn teerys to compleyne
The deth of gentilesse and of fraunchise
That al this world weldede in his demeigne
And ȝit hym thoughte it myghte nat suffyse
So ful was his corage  of high empryse
Allas ho schal me helpe to endyte
ffals fortune and poysoun to dispise
The whiche two of al this wo I wyte
 By wisdam manhod and by greet labour
From homble bed to royal mageste
Vp ros he Iulius the conquerour
That wan al th occydent bothe lond and se
By strenthe of hand or ellys by tretee
And vnto Roome made hem trybutarye
And sithe the Emperour of rome was he
Tyl that fortune wex his Aduersarye
    
 O myghty Cesar that in Thessalye
Ageyns Pompeynys fadyr thyn in lawe
That of thorient hadde al the Chiualrye  
As fer as that the day begynnyth dawe
Thow thour thyn kynghod hast hem take and slawe
Saue fewe folk that with Pompeious fledde
Thorw which thow puttist al the oryent in awe
Thanke fortune that so weel the spedde
But now a lytyl while I wele bewayle 
This Pompeyous this nobele gouernour
Of Rome whiche that fleigh at this batayle
I seye on of his men a fals traytour
His hed of smot to wynnyn hym fauour
Of Iulius and hym the hed he broughte
Allas Pompeye of thorient Conquerour
That ffortune vnto swich a fyn the broughte
To Rome agayn repayrith Iulius
With his tryumphe lauryat ful hye
But on a tyme Brutus Cassius
That euere hadde of his estaat enuye
Ful pryuyly hath mad conspiracye
Ageyns this Iulius in subtyl wise
And caste the place in whiche he schulde deye
With boydekynys  as I schal ȝow deuyse
This Iulius to the capitolye wente
Vpon a day as he was wone to goon
And in the Capitolye anon hym hente
This false Brutus and 1hese othere ffoon1
And stikede hym with Boydekynys anoon
With manye a wounde and thus they leete hym lye
But neuere gront he at no strok but oon
Or ellis at two  but if his storye lye
    
So manly was this Iulyus at herte
And so weel louyd estatly honeste
That thow hise dedly woundis soore smerte
His mental ouer his hepis castyth he
For non man schulde seen his priuyte  
And as he lay on deyinge in a traunce
And wiste verrayly that deed he muste bee
Of honeste ȝit hadde he remembraunce
Lucan to this storye I recomende
And to Swetoun and to valerius also
That of the storye wrytyn word and ende
How that these greete Conquerourys two
Fortune was fyrst freend and sithe a foo
No man ne truste vpon hire fauour longe
But haue hire in awayte for euere mo
Witnesse on alle these conquerourys stronge
 This ryche crysus whilom kyng of lyde
Of whiche Cresus  Cirus soore hym dradde
Ȝit was he caught amydde al his pryde
And to be brent men to the fuyr hym ladde
But swich a reyn doun from the walkyn shadde
That slow the fuyr and made hym to escape
But to be war no grace ȝit he hadde
Til fortune on the galwis made hym gape
Whan he escapid was 1he can nat stente1
For to begynne a newe werre agayn
He wende weel for that fortune hym sente
Swich hap that he escapid thour the rayn
That of hise fois he myghte nat been slayn
And ek a sweuene vpon a nyght he mette
Of which he was so proud and ek so fayn
That in vengeaunce he al his herte sette
      
Vpon a tre he was as that hym thouȝte
Where Iubiter hym wesch bothe bak and syde
And phebus ek a fayr towayle hym broughte
To dreye hym with and therfore wex his pryde
And to his doughtyr which that stod hym besyde
Which that he knew in high science habounde
He bad hire telle hym what it signefye  
And sche his dreem bygan ryght thus expoungne
The tre quod sche the galwis is to meene
And Iubiter bitokenyth snow and reyn
And Phebus with his towayle so cleene
Tho been the sunnys stremys for to seyn
Thow schat an hangede been fadyr certayn
Reyn schal the wasche and sounne schal the dreye
Thus warnede hym ful plat and ful pleyn
His doughtyr which that callede was Phanye
An hangede was Cresus the proude kyng
His royal trone myghte hym not avayle
Tragedy is noon othir manere thyng
Ne can in syngynge crye ne bewayle
But for that fortune al day wele assayle
With vnwar strok the regnys that been proude
For whan men trustyth hire thanne wele sche fayle
And couere hire brighte face with a cloude
O noble O worthy Petro glorie of Spayne
Whom fortune heeld so highe in mageste
Weel oughtyn men thyn petous deth to compleyne
Out of thyn land thyn brothir made the fle
And aftyr at a sege by subtyletee
Thow were betraysed and lad vnto his tente
Wheere as he with his owene hand slow the
Succedynge in thy regne and in thyn rente

Caugh with the lymerod colourede al with glede

The wekede nest was werkere of this neede
Nought Charles  Olyuer that tok ay hede
Of trouthe and honour but of armoryke

Of whiche tweyne oune lyges hadde envie
And for no thyng but for thy chiualrye
They in thyn bed han slayn the by the morwe
Thus can fortune  hire wheel gouerne and gye
And out of Ioye brynge men to sorwe
 Of Melan grete Bernabo Viscounte

Whi schulde I nough thyn Infortune acounte

Withinne his prysoun made the to deye
But why he how not I that thow weere slawe
 Of the Erl hugelyn of Pyre the langour
Theere may no tunge telle for pite
But lytyl out of Pize stant a tour
In which tour in prysoun put was he
And with hym been hise lyte childere thre
The oldeste skarsely fyue ȝeer was of age
Allas fortune it was greet crewelte
Swiche bryddis to putte in swich a cage
    
Dampnede was he to deye in that prysoun
For Roger which that bischop was of Pyze
Hadde on hym mad a fals suggestioun
Thour the peple gan vpon hym ryse
And puttyn hym in prysoun in swich wyse
As ȝe han herd and mete and drynk he hadde
So smal that wel anethe it may suffyse
And there withal it was fful poore and badde
And on a day byfel that in that hour
Whan that his meete  wont was to been brought

As in hys herte anone þere felle a þouȝt

Alas quod he Alas þat I was wrouȝt

Vnto hym said fader why do ȝe wepe
Whan wille þe Gaylour brynge our potage
Is þere no morselle brede þat ȝe do kepe
I am so hongerye þat I may not slepe
Nowe wolde god þat I myȝte slepen euere

Ther is nothyng saue breed that me were leuyr  
Thys day by day þe childe gan to crye

And said fadir fare wele I mot deye
And kyste hys fader and deyde þe same daye
And whan hys woofulle fadere did hym saye

And sayde fortune Alas and weylaway

In whiche she ete many a sclender mele
Of poynaunte sawce hir nedeth nevere a dele

And excercise and hert sufficiaunce

Ne poplexie ne shente nouȝt hir heede
Ne wyne dronke she neiþer whyte nor reede
Her bord was served moste with white and blake  
Mylke and browne brede in whiche she fonde no lake
Seynde bakon and some tyme an eye or tweie
ffor she was as hit were a manere of a deie
A gardeyne she hade enclosed alle aboute
With stykes and a drye dyche withoute
In whiche she hade a Cok þat hyȝt Chauntelere
In alle þe londe of Crawynge was hys peere

On masse dayes þat in þe Chirche goon

Of equynoxiol of þilke toune

His colour was reddere than the fyne coral  
And batayled as it were a castel wal
His byl was blak  and as the Ieet it schoon
Like asure weere hise leggis and hise toon
Hise naylis whittere  than the lylye flour
And lik the burnede gold was his colour
This gentil kok hadde in his gouernaunce
Seuene hennys for to doon al his plesaunce
Whiche weere hise susterys and hise paramouris
And wondyr lyk to hym of colourys
Of whiche the fayreste hewyd on hire throte
Was clepid fayre dameselle Pertelote
Curteys sche was  discreet and debonayre
And compaynable and bar hire self so fayre
Syn thilke day that sche was seue ȝeer old
That trewely sche hath the herte in hold
Of Chauntecleer lokyn in euery lith
He louede hym so that weel was hym therwith
But swich a Ioye it was to heere hem synge

With sweete acord myn lef is faryn on londe

Bestis and bryddis coude speke and synge
And so befel that in a dawenynge
As Chauntecleer among hise wyuys alle

And next hym sat Dame Pertelote
This Chauntecleer gan gronyn in his throte
  
As man that in his dreem is drechid sore
And whan that pertelote thus herde hym roore
Sche was agast and seyde herte deere
What eylyth ȝow to groone in this maneere

And he answerde thus  and seide Madame

Was lik an hound and wolde han mad areste

And typpid was his tayl and bothe hise eris
With blak onlyk the remenaunt of hise heris

Ȝit for his lok for fer almost I deye
This causede me myn gronyng douteles
Avoy quod sche fy on ȝow herteles

Of arwis and of fyr with rede lemys

Of wermys er ȝe take ȝoure laxatyues
Of lauriole sentaurye  and fumeteere

Dredyth no dreem I can seye ȝow no moore
Madame quod he graunnt mercy of ȝoure lore
But natheles as touchith Daun Catoun
That hath of wisdam swich a greet renoun
Thow that he bad no dremys for to dreede  
By god men may in olde bokis rede
Of manye a man moore of autorite
Than euere catoun was so mote I the
That al the reuers seyn of his sentence
And han weel foundyn by experience
That dremys been signyficaciounnys
As wel of ioye as of tribulaciounnys
That folk enduryn in this lyf present
Theere nedyth of this makyn non argument
The verray preue schewith it in dede
 Some of the gretteste autourys as men reede
Seyth thus that to felawys wente
On pilgrymage with a ful good ente
And happede so they comyn in a toun
Where as theere was swich a congregacioun
Of peple and ek so streyt of herbigage
That they ne founde as meche as a cotage
In whiche they myghe bothe Iloggede be
Wherefore they musten of necescite
As for that nyght departyn cumpaynye
And eche of hem goth to his ostellerye
  
And tok his logyng as it wolde falle
That on of hem was logit in a stalle
ffer in a ȝerd with oxin of the plough
That othir man was logid weel Inough
As was his auenture  or his fortune
That vs gouernyth alle as in comune
And so befel that longe er it was day
This man mette in his bed there as he lay
How that his felawe gan vpon hym calle
And seyde allas for in an oxis stalle
This nyght I schal been morderid there I lye
Now help me deere brotyr er I deye
In alle haste come to me he seyde
This man out of his slep for fer abreyde
And whan that he was wakenede of his slep
He turnede hym and tok of this no keep
Hym thoughte his dreem nas but a vanyte  
Thus twyis in his slepynge dremede he
And at the thredde tyme  ȝit his felawe
Cam as hym thoughte  and seyde I am now slawe
Byhold mynne blody woundis deepe and wyde
Aris vp erly in the morwe tyde
And at the west gate  of the toun quod he
A carteful of donge  there thu schat se
In wich myn body is hid ful pryuyly
Do thilke carte areste boldely
Myn gold causede myn mordere certeyn
And tolde hym euery poynt how he was slayn
With a wol pitous face pale of hewe
And truste weel this drem he fond ful trewe
ffor on the morwe as sone as it was day
To his felawe he tok te nexte way
And whan that he cam to his oxis stalle
Aftyr his felawe he began to calle
 The hosteleer answerede hym anon
And seyde sere ȝoure felawe is agoon
  
As sone as day he wente out of the toun
This man gan fallyn in suspecioun
Remembrynge hym on the dremys that he mette
And forth he goth no lengere wolde he lette
Vnto the Westgate of the toun and fond
A dong carte wente as it weere to dunge lond
That was arayed in that same wyse
As ȝe han herd the dede man deuyse
And with an hardy herte he gan to crye
Vengeaunce and Iustise of this felonye
Myn felawe morderede is this same nyght
And in this carte heere he lyth gapynge vpryght
I crye out on the mynystris quod he
That schulde kepe and rewele this cete
Harrowe allas here lyth myn felawe slayn
What schulde I moore vnto this tale sayn
The peple out sterte and caste the carte to grounde
And in the myddyl of the donge they founde
The dede man that morderede was al newe  
O blysful god that art so Iuste and trewe
Lo how that thow bewreyis mordere alway
Mordere wele out that se we day be day
Mordere is so wlatsome and abhomynable
To god that is so Iust and resonable
That he ne wele not suffere that it helid be
Thow it abyde a ȝeer or two or thre
Mordere wele out this myn conclusioun
And ryght anoon mynyste of that toun
Han hent the cartere and so sore hym pynyd
And ek the hosteller so soore engyned
That they beknewe here wikkedenesse anon
And weere an hangede by the nekke boon
Here may men seen that dremys been to drede
 And certis in the same bok I reede
Rygh in the nexte chapitere aftyr this
I gabbe not so haue I ioye or blys
  
Two men that wolde a passed ouyr the see
ffor certeyn cause into a fer cuntre
If that the wynd ne hadde been contrarye
That made hem in a cete for to tarye
That stod ful merye vpon an hauene syde
But on a day ageyn the euetyde
The wynd gan schaunge and blew rygh as hem leste
Iolyf and glad they wente to here reste
And castyn hem ful erly for to sayle
But herkenyth to that on man fyl a gret meruayle
That on of hem in slepynge as he lay
Hym mette a wondyr drem ageyn the day
Hym thoughe a man stod bi his bedys side
And hym comaunded that he schulde abyde
And seyde hym thus ȝif thow to morwe wende
Thow schat ben dreynk  myn tale is at an ende
He wok and tolde  his felawe what he mette
And preyede hym his viage for to lette
As for that day he preyede hym for to abide
His felawe that lay bi his bedys syde
Gan for to lauhe and skornde hym ful faste  
No drem quod he may so myn herte agaste
That I wele lette for to do myne thyngis
I sette not a straw  by thynne dremyngis
ffor dremys been but uanyteis and Iapis
Men dreme al day of oulis and of apis
And of manye a mase there withal
Men dreme of thyng that neuere was ne schal
But sithe I se that thow wild here abyde
And thus for slouthen  wilfully thyn tyde
God wot it rewith me  and haue good day
And thus he tok his leue and wente his way
But er that he hadde half his cours Iseyled
Not I not why  ne what myschaunce it eyled
But casewelly  the schipis boteme it rente
And schip and man vndyr the watyr wente
  
In sight of othere schepis besyde
That with hem seyled at the morwe tyde
And therefore fayre pertelote so deere
By sweche ensaumplis olde mayst thow leere
That no man schulde been so recheles
Of dremys for I seye the douteles
That manye a drem  ful soore is for to drede
Lo in the lyf of seynt kenelm I reede
That was kenulphus sone the noble kyng
Of Merturyke how kenelm mette a thyng
A lite er he was mordered on a day
His mordere in his auysioun he say
His noryce hym expoungnede euerydel
His sweuene  and bad hym  for to keepe hym weel
ffrom tresoun but he was but seuene ȝeer old
And therfore lytil taale hath he told
Of any drem so holy was his herte
By god I hadde leuere than myn scherte
That ȝe hadde rad his legende as haue I
Dame pertelote I seye ȝow trewely
Matrobeus that wret thauysioun
In Affryk of the worthi Ciprioun
Affermyth dremys and seyth that they been  
Warnynge of thyngis that men aftyr seen
And ferthere more I prey ȝow lokyth weel
In the olde testement of danyel
ȝif he helde dremys ony vanyte
Redyth ek of Iosep and there ȝe schul se
Wheere dremys ben sumtyme I seye nat alle
Warnynge of thyngis that schul aftyr falle
Loke of Egip the kyng daun pharao

Wheere they ne feltyn non effect in dremys
Who so wele seke actis of sundery remys
May reede of dremys manye a sundery thyng
Lo Cresus that was of lide kyng
  
Mette he nat how that he sat vpon a tre
Whiche signefyed anhangid schulde bee
Lo heere Andromatha ectoris wif
That day that Ector schulde lese his lyf
Sche dremede on the same nyght byforen
How that the lyf of Ector schulde been loryn
ȝif thilke day he wente into batayle
Sche warnede hym but it myghte nat auayle
He wente for to fyghte netheles
But he was slayn anoon of Achilles
But tylke tale is al to long to telle
And ek it is nygh day I may nat dwelle
Certeynly I seye as for conclusioun
That I schal han of this auysioun
Aduersite  and I seye fertheremoore
That I ne telle of laxatyuys no store
ffor they been venimes I wot it weel
I hem defye I loue hem neuere a deel
Now lat vs speke of myrthe and stynte al this
Madame pertelote so haue I blys
Of on thyng god hath sent me large grace
ffor whanne I se the beute in ȝoure face

It makyth al myn dred  for to deyen

Mulier est homins confusio
Madame the sentence of this latyn is
Woman is manys Ioye and al his blys
ffor whan I fele a nyght ȝoure softe syde
Al be it that I may nat on ȝow ryde
ffor that oure perche is mad so narw allas
I am so ful of Ioye and of solas
That I defye bothe sweuene and drem
And with tht word he fley doun from the beem
ffor it was day and ek hise hennys alle
And with a chuk he gan hem for to calle
  
ffor he hadde foundyn a corn lay in the ȝerd
Royal he was he nas no moore aferyd
He feterede Pertelote twenty tyme
And trad as ofte er it was pryme
He lokyth as it weere a grym lyoun
And on hise tois he romyth vp and doun
Hym deynyth nat to sette hise feet to grounde
He chukkith whan he hath a corn Ifounde
And to hym rennyn thanne hise wyuys alle
Thus royal as a prynce is in an halle
Leue I this chauntecleer in his pasture
And aftyr wele I telle his auenture
 Whan that the monythe  in which that the world began
That highe March  whan god ferst makede man
Was compleet and passede weere also
Syn March bygan 30 dayis and two
Byfel that chauntecleer in al his pryde
His seuene wyuys walkynge hym bysyde
Caste vp hire eyen to the bryghte sunne
That in the signe of taurus hadde Irounne
Twenty degreis and on and sumwhat moore
And knew by kynde and by noon othir lore
That It was pryme and krew with bysful steuene
The sunne on heye is clombyn vp on heuene
90 degreis and on and moore Iwis
Madame pertelote myn wordelis blys
Herkenyth these blysful brydis how they synge  
And se the frosche flouris how they sprynge

But sodeynly hym fel a sorweful cas

God wot that wordely ioye  is soone ago
And ȝif a retor coude fayre endyte

As for a souereyn notabilyte
Now euery wise man now herkene me
  
This storye is also trewe I vndyrtake
As Is the bok of launcelot de lake
That women heelde in ful greet reuerence
Now wele I turne ageyn to myn sentence
A col fox ful of sly Iniquite
That in the groue hadde dwelled ȝeris thre
By hygh Imaginacioun forcast
The same nyght thourout the hegis brast
Into the ȝerd there chauntecleer the fayre
Was wont and ek hise wyuys to repayre
And In a bed of wortis stylle he lay
Til it was passed onderen of the day
Waytynge his tyme on Chauntecleer to falle
As gladly doon these homycidis alle

O false morderour lurkynge in thyn den
O newe Scariot  newe Genysoun

O Chauntecheer acursede be that morwe
That thow into that ȝerd  flaw from the bemys
Thow weere ful weel Iwarnede be thynne dremys

But what that god forwot mot nedis be
Aftyr the opynioun of certeyn clerkis
Witnesse on hym that ony perfyt clerk is
That in scole is greet altercacioun
In this matiere and greet disputacioun
And han been of an hunderede thousent men  
But I can not butte it to the breen
As can the holy doctour Augustyn
Or Boece or the bisshop Bradwardyn
Whethir that goddys worthi forwetyng
Streynyth me nedely for to do that thyng
Needely clepe I symple necescite
Or ellis fre choys be grauntede me
  
To do that same thyng or do it not
Thow god forewot it er that I was wrought
Or ȝif his wetynge streynyth neuere a deel
But by necescite condiciounnel
I wele not han to done of swich mateere
Myn tale is of a cok as ȝe may here
That tok his conseyl of his wif with sorwe
To walkyn in the ȝerd vpon that morwe
That he hadde met the drem that I ȝow tolde
Womenys conseylis been ful oftyn colde
Womenys conseylis broughte vs ferst to woo
And made Adam from paradys to go
Theere as he was ful merye and weel at ese
But for I not to whom I myghte displese
ȝif I conseyl of women wolde blame
Passe ouyr for I seyde it in myn game
Reede autouris wheere they trete of sweche matiere
And what they sey  of women  ȝe may here
These been the cokkis wordis and nat myne
I can noon harm on no woman deuynne
ffayre in the sond to bathe hire meryely
Lyth Pertelote and alle hire susteryn by
Ageyn the sunne and Chauntecleer so free
Song meryere than the mermeydyn in the se
ffor phisiologus seyth sekyrly
How that they syngyn weel and meryely
And so befel that as he caste his yen
Among the wortis on a botyrflye
He was war of this fox that lay ful lowe
No thyng ne lyste hym thanne for to crowe
But criede anoon kok kok and vp he styrte  
As man that was afrayed in his herte
ffor naturelly  a beste desirith fle
ffrom his contrarye  ȝif he myghte it se
Thow he neuere erst hadde sey it with his Iye
 This chauntecleer whan he gan hym espye
  
He wolde a fled but that the fox anoon
Seyde gentyl sire  allas whidyr wole ȝe goon
Be ȝe afrayed of me that am ȝoure freend
Now certys I were werse than a feend
ȝyf I to ȝow harm or velenye
I am nat come ȝoure conseyl for tespie
But trewely the cause of myn comynge
Was only for to herkene how that ȝe synge
ffor trewely ȝe han so merie a steuene
As ony aungel hath that is in heuene
Therewith ȝe han In musik moore felyng
Than hadde boece or ony that can syng
Myn lord ȝoure fadyr god his soule blys
And ek ȝoure modyr of hire gentilles
Han in myn hous Ibeen to myn greete ese
But certys syre ful fayn wolde I ȝow pleese
 But for men speke of syngyng I wil seye
So mote I broukyn weel myn eyen tweye
Saue ȝow I herde neuere man so synge
As dede ȝoure fadyr in the morwenynge
Certis it was of herte al that he song
And for to make his voys the moore strong
He wolde peyne hym that with bothe hise eyen
He muste wynke so loude he muste cryen
And stondyn on his typton therewithal
And streche forth his nekke long and smal
And ek he was of swich discrecyoun
That there was no man in no regioun
That hym in song or wisdam myghte passe
I haue weel red in daun burnel the Asse
Among hise vers how that ther was a kok
ffor a prestis sone ȝaf hym a knok
Vpon his leg whil he was ȝond and nyce  
He made hym for to lese his benefice
But certeyn there ne is no comparisoun
Bytwixe the wisdom and discrecioun
  
Of ȝoure fadyr and of his subtiletee
Now syngith sere for seynte charite
Lat se cunne ȝe ȝoure fadyr countyrfete
This chauntecleer hise wyngis gan to beete
As man that coude his tresoun nat aspye
So was he rauyschid with his flaterye
 Allas ȝe lordis manye a flaterour
Is in ȝoure court and manye a losengeour
That plesen ȝow weel more be myn fayth
Than he that sothfastmesse vn to ȝow sayth
Redyth ecclesiaste of flaterye
Beth war ȝe lordis of hire trecherye
This Chauntecleer stood hye vpon hise tois
Strechynge his neke and held his eyen clos
And gan to crowe loude for the nonys
And daun Rusell the fox styrte vp at at anys
And by the garget hente Chauntecleer
And on his bak to the wode hym beer
ffor ȝit theere ne was no man that hym sewid
O destene that mayst nat been eschewid
Allas that Chauntecleer fley from the bemys
Allas his wyf ne roughte nat of dremys
And on a fryday fil al this myschaunce
O venus that art goddesse of plesaunce
Syn that thyn seruaunt was this chautecleer
And in thyn seruyse dede al his power
Moore for delyt than world to multeplye
Why woldist tow suffere hym on thyn day to deye
O ganfryd deere maystyr souereyn
That whan thyn worthy kyng Richard was slayn
With schot compleynedist his deth so soore
Whi ne hadde Inough thyn centence and thyn loore
The fryday for to chide as dedyn ȝe
ffor on a fryday sothly slayn was he
Thanne wolde I schewyn how that I coude pleyne  
ffor Chauntecleeres dreede and for his peyne
  
 Certis swich cry ne lamentacioun
Was neuere of ladijs mad whan ylyoun
Was wone and Pirrus with his streyte swerd
Whan that he hadde hent kyng priame bi the berd
And slayn hym as seyth vs Enidos
As madyn alle the hennys in the cloos
Whan they hadde of Chauntecler the syght
But souereynly dame Pertelote shryght
fful loudere than dede Hasdrubalis wyf
Whan that hire husbonde hadde ylost his lyf
And that the Romaynys haddyn brent Cartage
Sche was so ful of turnement and of rage
That wilfully into the feer sche sterte
And brende hire seluyn with a stedefaste herte
O woful hennys ryght so cryedyn ȝe
As whan that nero brende the Cete
Of Rome cryedyn  Senatouris wyuys
ffor that here husbondys lostyn alle here lyuys
Withoutyn gylt this Nero hath hem slayn
Now wole I turne to myn tale agayn
 The sely wedewe and ek here doughteryn two
Herdyn these hennys crye and makyn wo
And out at the dorys stirte they anon
And seyen the fox toward the groue gon
And bar vpon his bak the Cok away
And cryedyn out harow and weyleawey
Ha ha the fox and aftyr hym they ran
And ek with stonys many anothir man
Ran Colle oure doge and talbot and Garland
And Malkyn with a distaf in hire hand
Ran cow and Calf and ek the verray hoggis
fforfered for berkynge of the doggis
And schoutyng of the men and women ek
They ronne so they thoute here herte brek
They ȝelledyn as fendis doon in helle
The dokis cryedyn as men wolde hem quelle    

The gees for feer flowyn ouyr the trees
So hidous was the nois a benedicite
Certis he Iak strawe and his meyne
Ne made neuyr schoutis half so schrille
When that thei wolde anye fflemyng kille
As that ilke daie was made vpon the ffox  
Of bras thei broght bemes and of box
Of horn and boon in whiche thei poupid
And ther with all thei schrichid and schoutid
It semyd as that heuyn schulde falle
Now good men I praie you herkenyth alle
Lo how fortune turneth sodenlye
The hope and eke pride of her enuye
This Cok that laie vp on the ffox bak
In all his drede vnto the ffox spak
And seide sir if I were as ye
Yet schulde I seie as wis god helpe me
Turne ayen ye proude chirles alle
A verry pestilence vpon you falle
Now am I come vnto this Wode side
Maugre your heed the Cok schall here abide
I woll hym ete in feyth and that anon
The ffox answerid in feith it schall be don
And he spak that word all sodenly
This Cok brak fro his mouthe delyuerly
And hye vp on a tre he flewe a non
And when the ffox sawe that he was gon
Alas quod he O chauntecler allas
I haue quod he don to you trespas
In as meche as I made you aferde
When I you hent and broght out of the yerde
But sir I dide it noght in no wicked entent
Cometh downe and I schall telle you what I ment
I schall seie soth so god helpe me so
Naie than quod he I schrewe vs bothe two
  
And first I schrewe my self bothe blood and bones
If thou begile me ofter than ones
Thou schalt no more with thi flaterie
Do me syng and wynke with myn ye
ffor he that wynketh when he schulde se
As wisly god lete hym neuyr the
Naie quod the ffox god yeue hym myschaunce
That is so vndiscrete of gouernaunce
That iangleth when he schulde haue pees
Lo suche is for to be recheles
And necligent and trusteth on flaterie
But ye that holdyn this folie
As of a ffox of a Cok and of an hen
Taketh the moralite good men
ffor seynt Poule seith all that writen is
To our doctryne it is writen ywis
Taketh the fruyt and letith the chaf be stille

As seith my lorde so make vs alle good men

And sondry werkes briȝt of Excellence
And riȝt as þe phylosophre wryte

And rounde and hoole in goode perseuerynge
And brenne euere in Charite liȝt
Nowe haue I declared you what she hiȝt
This mayd bryȝt Cecile as hir lyf sayþe
Was comen of Romayns and of noble kynde
And so forthe forstred vp in þe feiþe
Of Cryst and bare his Gospel in hir mynde
Sche neuere sesede as I wryten fynde
Of hir prayers but god to loue and drede
Besechynge hym to kepen hir maydenhede
And whan þis Mayde shulde vnto a man

The whiche ycleped was Valerian
And þe day was come of hir maryage
She fulle deuoute and humble in hir corage
Vnder hir robe of golde þat sat fulle fayre
And nexte hir flesshe ycladde was in heyre
  
And while þe Organes made melodye
To god alle loue þus in hert sange she
O lord my saule and eke my body gye
Vnwemmed leste I confounded be
And for hys loue þat deyde vpon a tre
Euery second or þrid day she faste
Ay bydynge in hir Orisons fulle faste

With her husbond as ofte is the manner
And preuyly to hym sche saide Anoon1

Whiche that rygh fayn I wolde vnto ȝow seye
So that ȝe swere ȝe schul it nat bewreye

And thanne at erst to hym seyde sche

That with greet loue wheere so I wake or sleepe

But ȝif that he may felyn out of dreede

And ȝif that ȝe in cleene loue me gye

And whan that he hath purgede ȝow from synne

And with that word anoon there gan apeere

And gan byforn valeryan to stonde

And on his bok rygh thus he gan to reede

Corounnys two the whiche he bar in honde
And fyrst to cecilie as I vndirstonde

With body cleene and with vnwemmede thought
Kepith ay cleene these coronys quod he

And thow Valerian for thow so soone

Sey what the lyste and thow schat haue thyn boone

To knowe the trouthe as I do in this place

And with that word Tiburse his brothyr coom

Whens that the sote sauour comyth so
Of rose and lylyis  that I smelle heere

And of the myrakele of these coronys tweye

To whiche god of his bounte wolde shifte

And made his aungel hem the corounnys to brynge
This maydyn hath brought hem to blysse aboue  
The world hat wist  what it is wroth certeyn

Tho schewede hym Cecile al opyn and pleyn
That alle ydolis nys but a thyng in veyn

And chargede hym hise ydolis for to leue
Who so that trowith not this a beste he is

And sche gan kisse his brest that herde this
And was ful glad he coude trouthe espye

Go with thyn brothir now and the baptyse
And make the clene so that thow mowe beholde

And wonyth in halkis alwey two and fro
And dar nat onys putte forth his heed

And we also to bere hym compaynye
And whil we seke thilke dyuinite

Algate Ibrend in this world schul we be

But theere is betere lyf in othir place

With godys sone  vs tolde thour his grace
That faderis sone hath alle thyngis wrouȝt
And al that wrouȝt is with a skylful thouȝt
The gost that from the fadyr gan procede
Hath soulede hem withoutyn ony dreede
  
By word and by myrakele he goddis sone
Whan he was in this world declared heere
That theere is othir lyf  theere men may wone
To whom answerde Tiburce o sistyr deere
Ne seydist tow right now in this maneere

And now of thre  how maystow bere witnesse

Tho gan sche hym ful busili to preche
Of Cristis sone and of hise peynys teche
And manye poyntis of hise passioun
How goddis sone in this world was withholde
To doon mankynde pleyn remyssioun
That was Iboundyn in synne and caris colde
Al this thyng sche vnto tiburce tolde
And aftyr this Thiburce with good entente
With valerian to pope vrban he wente
That thankede god and with good herte and lyght  
He cristenede hym and made hym in that place
Parfit in his lernynge goddis knyght
And aftyr this Tibure gat swich grace
That eueri day he saw in tyme and space
The aungel of god and euery manere boone
That he god axed it was sped ful soone
  
It weere ful hard by ordere for to seyn
How manye wonderis Ihesu for hem wroughte
But at the laste to tellyn schort and pleyn
The sergeauntis of the toun of rome hem souȝte
And hem byforn almache the prefect broughte
Which hem opposede and knew al hire entente
And to the ymage of Iupiter hem sente—
And seyde ho so wele not sacrifise
Swap of his heed this myn centence heere
Anoon these martiris that I ȝow deuyse
On Maximus that was an officeere
Of the Prefectis and his Corniculeere
Hem hente and whan he forth the seyntis ladde
Hym self he wepte for pite that he hadde
Whan Maximus hadde herd the seyntis loore
He gat hym of the turmentouris leeue
And ladde hem to his hous withoutyn moore
And with heere prechyng er than it was eue
They gunne from the turmentouris to reue
And from Maxime and from hise folk echoone
The false feith to trowe in god aloone
Cecile cam whan it was wexe nyght
With prestis that hem cristenede alle in feere
And aftyrward whan day was wexen lyght

Now cristis owene knyghtis leue and deere

And armyth ȝow in armys  of brightnesse

Goth to the coroun of lyf that may nat fayle
The rightful Iuge  which that ȝe han seruyd
Schal ȝeue it ȝow right as ȝe han seruyd
And whan this thyng was seyd as I deuyse
Men ledde hem forth  to don the sacrifise
But whan they weere to the place brought
To tellyn schortely the conclusyoun
The nolde encense ne sacrifise right noght
But on here kneis they settyn hem adoun
With humble herte and sad deuocioun
And leftyn bothe here heuedis in the place
Here soulis wentyn to the kyng of grace
This Maximus that saw this thyng betyde
With pituse teris tolde it anon right
That he here soulis saw to heuene glyde
With aungellis ful of cleernesse and of ligh
And with his word conuertede manye a wight
ffor whiche Almachius dide hym so beete
With whippe of leed til he his lyf gan lete
Cecile hym tok and buried anon
Bi Tiburce and Valirian softely
Withinne hire buriinge place vndyr the stoon
And aftyr this Almathius hastili
Bad hise mynystris fightyn opynly

But they conuertid at here wise loore
Weptyn ful soore and ȝeuyn ful credence
Vnto hire word and cryedyn moore and moore

Is verray goddys sone this al oure centence
That hath so good a seruaunt hym to serue
This with on vois we trowyn thow we sterue
Almachius that herde al this doing  
Bad feche Cecile that he myghte hire se
And aldyr ferst lo this was his axsyng
What manere woman art thow quod he

I axe the quod he thow it the greeue
Of thyn religioun and of thin beleeue

Quod sche that woldyn to answeris conclude
In on demaunde ȝe axsyn lewedely
Almache answerede vnto that simylitude
Of whens comyth thyn answerynge so rude
Of whens quod sche  whan that sche was freynyd
Of concience and of good feyth vnfeynyd
Almachius seyde ne takist thow noon hede
Of myn powere and sche answerde him thus
ȝoure myght quod sche ful lytil is to drede
ffor euery manys mortal power nys
But lyk a bladdere ful of wynd Iwis
ffor with a nedellis poynt whan it is blowe
May al the bost of it been leyd ful lowe

And ȝit in wrong is al thyn perseueraunce
Wost tow not how oure myghti pryncis free
Han thus comaundit and mad ordenaunce
That euery cristene whight schal han penaunce
But ȝif that he his cristendom withseye
And goon al quik ȝif he wele it reneye
Ȝoure pryncis erryn as ȝoure nobleye doth
Quod tho Cecile  and with a wood centence

To Cryst and for we bere a cristene name
Ȝe puttyn on vs a cryme and ek a blame
But we that knowen thilke name  
ffor vertuous we may it not withseye
Almache answerde chees on of these two
Do sacrifise and cristendam reneye
That thow mowe escape by that weye
At which this holy blysful fayre mayde
Gan for to laughe and to the Iuge sayde
O Iuge confus in thyn nycete
Wilt thow that I reneye Innocence
To makyn me a wikkede wight quod sche
Lo he dissimulyth here in audience

To whom Almachius onsely wreche
Ne wost thow not how fer myn mygh may streche
  
Han not oure mighti pryncis to me ȝeuyn

Whi spekist thow so proudely thanne to me

Thow seyst thynne pryncis han the ȝouyn myght

Thow hast non othir power ne no leue
But thow mayst seyn thynne pryncis han the makid
Ministre of deth  for ȝif thow speke of mo
Thow lyist for thyn power is ful nakyd
Do wey thyn boldenesse seyde Almathius thoo
And sacrifise to the goddis er thow go
I reche nat what wrong that thow me profere
ffor I can suffere it as a Philisophere
But thilke wrongis may I not endure  
That thow spekist of oure goddis heere quod he
Cecile answerde o nyce creature
Thow seydist no word syn thow spake with me
That I ne knew therwith thyn nycetee
And that thow were in euery maner wise
A lewede offiser and veyn Iustise
  
Teere lakkyth no thyng to thyn vtter Iyen
That thow nart blynd  for thyng that we seen alle
That is a stoon that men may wel espyen
That ilke stoon a god thow wilt it calle

And taste it weel and ston thow schalt it fynde
Syn that thow sest nat with thynne eyin blynde
It is schame that the peple schal
So scorne the and laghe at thyn folye
ffor comounly men wot it weel oueral
That myghty god is in hise heuenys hye
And these ymagis weel thow mayst espie
To the ne to hem self may nought profyghte
ffor in effect they been nat worth a myghte
These wordis and swiche othere seyde sche
And he wex wroth and bad men schulde hire leede
Hom to hire hous  and in hire hous quod he
Brenne hire right in a bath with flambis reede
And as he bad ryȝt so was doon the dede
ffor in a bath the gune hire faste schette
And nygh and day greet fyr they vndyr bette
The longe nyght and ek a day also
ffor al the feer and ek the bathis heete
Sche sat al cold and felede no woo
It made hire not a drope for to sweete
But in that bath hire lyf muste sche lete

To sleen hire in the bath his sonde sent
  
Thre strokis in the nekke he smoot hire tho  
The turmentour but for no manere chaunce
He myghte nat smyte al hire nekke a two
And for there was that tyme an ordynaunce
That no man schulde doon  man swich penaunce
The fourte strook to smyte soffte or sore
This turmentour ne durste doon no moore
But half deed with hire nekke Ikoruyn theere
He lefte hire lye  and on his woye is went
The cristene folk whiche that aboute hire weere
With scheetis han the blood ful fayre Ihent
Thre dayis leuede sche in that turnement
And neuere sesede hem the feyth to teche
That sche hadde fosterede hem sche gan to preche
And hem sche ȝaf hire meoblis and hire thyng
And to the Poope Vrban bitok hem tho
And seyde I axede this of heuene kyng

Aboute þe pey fom ful hye
He was of foom al flekked as a pye
A male twifold on his croper lay
It semede that he cariede lyte aray
Al lygh for somyr rod this worthi man
And in myn herte wonderyn I began
What that he was that I vndyrstood
How that his cloke was sowid to his hood
ffor which whanne I longe hadde auysede me
I demede hym a schanoun for to be
His hat hyng doun at his bak by a lace
ffor he hadde redyn moore than trot or pace
He hadde ay prikyd lyk as he were wood
A cloote lef he hadde vndyr his hood
ffro swot and for to kepe his heed from heete
But it was Ioye for to seen hym sweete
His forhed dropped as a stillatorie
Were ful of plauntayn and of permytorye
  
And whan that he was come he gan to crye
God saue quod he this fayre compaynye
ffaste haue I prikyd quod he for ȝoure sake
By cause that I wolde ȝow a take
To rydyn in this murye cumpaynye
His ȝeman ek was ful of curteysie
And seyde sens now in the morwe tyde
Out of ȝoure hostelrye I saw ȝow ryde
And warnede heere myn lord and myn souereyn
Which for to ridyn with ȝow is ful fayn
ffor his disport he lout

Thanne seyde oure h

And ȝe hym knewe a that do I
Ȝe woldyn wondere how weel and craftyly
He coude werke and that in sundery wise
He hath takyn on hym manye a greet emprise
Whiche were ful hard for ony that is heere
To brynge aboute but 2they of hym it leere2
As hoomely as he rit amongis ȝow
Ȝif ȝe hym knewe it wolde be for ȝoure prow
ȝe wolde nat forgoon his aqueyntaunce
ffor meche good I dare leye in balaunce
Al that I haue in myn possessioun
He is a man of heigh discrecioun
I warne ȝow weel he is a passynge man
Weel quod oure host I preye the telle me than
Is he clerk or noon I preye the telle me this
Nay he is grettere than a clerk Iwis
  
Seyde this ȝeman and in wordis fewe
Hoost of his craft sumwhat I wele ȝow schewe
I seye myn lord can swich sotyletee
But al his craft ȝe may nat wete at me
And sumwhat helpe I ȝit to his werkyng
That al this ground on which we been rydyng
Til that we comyn to cauntyrbery toun
He coude al clene turne vp so doun
And paue it al of syluyr and of gold 
And whan this ȝeman hadde this Itold
Vnto oure host he seyde benedicite
This thyng is wondyr meruelious to me
Syn that thyn lord is of so hegh prudence  
By cause of which men wolde hym reuerence
That of his worschepe rekkith he but lyte
His ouere sloppe nys nat worth a myte
As in effect to hym so mote I go
It is al baudit and totore also
Whi is thyn lord so slottysch I the preye
And is of power betere cloth to beye
If that his deede acordit with his speche
Tel me that and that I the beseche
 Whi quod this ȝeman wherto axe ȝe me
God help me so for he schal neuere the
But I wele nat awowe that I seye
And therfore kepe it secre I ȝow preye
He is to wis in feyth as I beleue
That is ouerdone it wele nat preue
Aryght  as clerkis seyn it is a vice
Wherfore in that I helde hym lewid and nyce
ffor whan a man hath ouergreet a wit
fful ofte hym happith to mysusen it
So doth myn lord and that me greuyth soore
God it amende I can sey ȝow na moore
Therof no fors goode ȝeman quod oure hoost
Syn of the cunnyng of thyn lord thow wost
  
Telle how he doth I preye the hertyly
Syn that he is so crafty and so sly
Wheere dwellyn ȝe  ȝif it to tellyn be
In the subarblis of a toun quod he
Lurkynge in hernys and in lanys blynde
Where as these robbouris and these theuys by kynde
Holdyn here priue ferful residence
As they that dore nat schewe here presence
So fare we ȝif I schal seye the sothe
Now quod oure hoost ȝit lat me speke to the

Petir quod he god ȝeue it harde grace
I am so vsed in the fuir to blowe
That it hath chaunged myn colour I trowe
I am not wone in no myrour to prye  
But swynke sore and lerne multeplye
We blundere euere and poure in the fuyr
And for al that we fayle of oure desyr
ffor euere we lakke oure conclusioun
To muche folk we doon illusyoun
And borwe gold be it a pound or two
Or ten or twelve or manye summys mo
And makyn hem to wenyn at the leste weye
That of a pound we coudyn make tweye
ȝit is it fals but ay we han good hope
It for to doon and aftyr it we grope
But that science is so fer vs beforen
We mow not althogh we haddyn it sworen
It ouyrtake it slyt awey so faste
It wele vs make beggeris at the laste
 Whil this ȝeman was thus in his talkyng
This chanoun drow hym neer and herde alle thyng
Which this ȝeman spak  for suspecioun
Of menys speche  euere hadde this chanoun
for Catoun seyth he that gilty is
Demyth alle thynge is seyd of hym Iwis
  
That was the cause he gan so nygh hym drawe
To his ȝeman to herkenyn al his sawe
And thus he seyde vnto his ȝeman tho
Hold thow thyn pees and spek no wordis mo
ffor ȝif thow do thow schat it dere abeye
Thow slaunderyst me  heere in this cumpaynye
And ek discouerist that thow schuldist hide
Ȝa quod oure ost telle on whatso betyde
Of al this thretyng relke nat a myte
Infeyth quod he namore I do but lyte
And whan this chanoun saw it wolde nat be
But his ȝeman wolde telle his pryuyte
He fledde awey for verray sorwe and schame
A quod the ȝeman here schal aryse game
Al that I can anon now wele I telle

And ȝit for alle my smert and alle my greef

Nowe wolde god my wytte myȝt  suffice
To tellen alle þat longethe to þat arte
But nathles ȝit wylle I telle you part
Syþens þat my lorde ys gone I wolle not spare
Suche þenge as I knowe I wille declare
Wyth þis Chanon dwellyd haue I seuen ȝeere
And of hys science neuere þe nere
And þat I hade I haue loste þerby
And god woote so hathe mony mo þan I
There I was wonte to be riȝt fresshe and gay
Of cloþinge and of gode array
Nowe may I were an hose vpon myne hede
And where my coloure was bothe fressh and reede
Nowe it ys wan and of a len hewe
Who so hit vseþe sore shalle he rewe
And of my swynke blered ys myn eyee
Lo whiche avauntage hit ys to multiply
þat slydynge science hathe me made so bare
That I haue no gode where þat euere I fare
And ȝit  I am endetted so þer by
Of golde þat I haue borowed truly
þat whyle I lyue hit shalle I quyte nevere
lat euery man by ware by me for euere

But empten his purs and make his wittis thynne
And whan he thorough his madnesse and folye
Hath lost his owne good thorough iopardye
Than he exitith other men therto
To lese her good as hym self haþ do  
ffor vnto shrewes Ioye hit ys and ese  
To haue hir felawes in peyne and dissese
  
Thys was I oones lerned of a Clerke
Of þat no Charge I wolle speke of oure werke

Of þenges whiche þat we worchen vppoun
As on fyue or sixe vnces may wele be
Of siluere or of som oþere quantite
And besye me to telle ȝow the namys  
Of orpemynt brend bonys  Iren squamys
That in to poudere grounde been ful smal
And in an erthene pot how put is al
And salt Iput in and also papeer
Byfore these pouderis that I speke of heer
And weel Ikeuered with a laumpe of glas
And of muche othir thyng whiche there was
And of the pot and glasis enlutynge
That of the ayr myghte passe out nothynge
And of the esy fuyr and smert also
Whiche that was mad and the care and wo
That we hadde in oure mateeris sublymyng

Of oure orpemynt and sublimyd mercurye

And al the cost a twenty deuelleweye

Ther is also ful manye anothir thyng
That is vnto oure craft aperteynynge
Thow I be ordere  hem nat reherce can

Ho so that lystyth outyn his folye  
Let hym come forth and lerne multeplye
And euery man that hat ought in his cofere
Lat hym apere and wexe a philysophere
Ascauns that craft is so lyght to lere
Nay nay god wot al be he monk or frere

To lerne a lewede man this sotylete

And kunne he lettereure or cunne he non

For bothe to be myn saluacioun

This is to seyn they fayle bothe twe

Of wateris coresif and of lemayle
And of bodyis mollyficacioun
And also of here induracioun
  
Oyles absolucioun  and metal fusible
To tellyn al wolde passyn any bible
That ower is  wherefore as for the beste
Of alle these namys now wele I me reste
ffor as I trowe I haue ȝow told Inogh
To reyse a fend al loke he neuere so rogh
 A nay lat be the philisopheris stoon
Elixer clepid  we sekyn faste echon
ffor hadde we hym we were sekyr Inogh
But on to god of heuene I make a wow
ffor al oure craft whan we han al Ido
And al oure sleyghte he wele nat come vs to
He hath Imad vs spende mechil good
ffor sorwe of whiche almost  we wexe wood
But that good hope crepith in oure herte
Supposynge euere thow we sore smerte
To be releuyd by hym aftyrward   
Swich supposynge and hope is scharp and hard
I warne ȝow wel it is to sekyn euere
That future temps that made men to disseuere
In trust therof from al that euere they hadde
ȝit of that art they can not wexe sadde
ffor vnto hem it is a bittyr swete
So semyth it for ne hadde they but a schete
Whiche that they myghte wrappe hem in a nyght
And a bakke for to walke in be day light
They wolde hem selue  and spendyn on this craft
They can not stynte til no thyng be laft
And euere more where that euere they goon
Men may hem knowe by smel of bronston
ffor al the world they stynkyn as a got
Here sauour is so rammysch and so hot
That thow a man from hem a myle bee
The sauour wele enfecte hem trustyth me
Lo thus be smellynge and thredbare aray
ȝif that men lyste these folk knowe may
  
And ȝif a man wele aske hem pryuyly
Whi that they been clothid so vnthriftyly
They righ anon wele rounne in his ere
And seyn ȝif that they espied were
Men woldyn hem sle by cause of here science
Lo thus these folk betrayen innocence
Passe ouer this I go myn tale vnto
Er than the pot be on the fyre Ido
Of metallis with a certeyn quantite
Myn lord hem tempereth and no man but he
Now he is goon I dar say boldely
ffor as men saye he can do craftyly
Algate I wot wel he hath swich a name
And ȝit ful ofte he rennyth in a blame
 And wete ȝe how ful oftyn it happith soo
The pot tobrekith and farwel al is go
These metallis been of so greet violence
Oure wallis mowe not make hem resistence
But ȝif they were wrought of lym  and ston  
They perce so and thour the wal they gon
And some of hem synke into the ground
Thus haue we lost be tymys manye a pound
And some are skaterede in the flor aboute
Some lepe into the rof  withoutyn doute
Thow that the fend nat in the sight hym schewe
I trowe he with vs be that ilke schrewe
In helle where as he is lord and syre
Ne is there more wo ne more rancour ne yre
Whan that oure pot as I haue sayd 
Euery man chit  and halt hym euelle apayed
Some seyn it was along on the fyr makyng
Some seydyn nay  it was on the blowyng
Thanne was I aferid  for that was myn offis
Straw quod the thredde  ȝe been lewede and nys
It was nat tempered as it aughte to be
Nay quod the forte stynt and lestene to me
  
By cause oure fyr was not mad of bech
That is the cause and othir noon so theech
I can not telle wheron it was long
But wel I wot greet stryf is vs among
 What quod myn lord there is no more to done
Of these perilis I wele be war eft sone
I am rygh sekyr that the pot was crased
Be as be may be ȝe no thyng amased
As vsage is lat swepe the flor aswythe
Pluk vp ȝoure hertys and beth glad and blythe
The mullok on an hep Iswepid was
And on the flor Icaste a canevas
And al the mullok in a seue Ithrowe
And syftid and Ipikid manye a throwe
 Parde quod on  sumwhat of oure metal
ȝit is ther heere they that we haue nat al
And thow this thyng mys happe as now
Anothir tyme it may be weel Inow
Vs muste putte oure good in auenture
A marchaunt parde may not alwey endure
Trustyth me wel in his prosperite  
Sumtyme his good is drouned in the se
And sumtyme comyth it saf vnto the londe
Pes quod myn lord the nexte tyme wele I fonde
To brynge oure craft al in anothir plit
And but I do sere lat me han the wit
There was defaute in sumwhat wel I wot
Anothir seyde the fuyr was ouyr hot
But be it hot or cold I dare seye this
That we concludyn euere more amys
We fayle of that whiche that we woldyn haue
And in oure madnesse eueremore we raue
And whan we been togederis euerichon
Euery man semyth a salamon
But alle thynge whiche that schynyth as the gold
Nis nat gold  as I haue herd told
  
Ne eueri appil that is fayr at eye
Ne is nat good  what so men clappe or crye
Righ so lo faryth it amongis vs
He that semyth the wiseste be Iesus
Is most fol whan it comyth to the pref
And he that semyth treweste is a thef
That schal ȝe knowe er that I from ȝow wende
By that I of myn tale haue mad an ende
 There is a chanoun of religioun
Amongis vs wolde enfecte al a toun
They it as gret were as was nynyue
Rome Alysaundir Troye  and othere thre
Hise sleyghtis and his infinit falsenesse
There coude no man write as I gesse
Thow that he myghte leue a thousend ȝeer
In al this world of falshed nys his per
ffor in hise termys he so wel hym wyndis
And spekyn hise wordis in so slye kyndis
Whan he comune schal with ony wight
That he wele make hym dote anon ryght
But it a fend be as hym seluyn is
fful manye a man hath he begyled er this
And wele ȝif that he leue may a while  
And ȝit men ride and goon ful manye a myle
Hym for to seke and haue his acqueyntaunce
Not knowynge of his false gouernaunce
And ȝif ȝow liste to ȝeue me audyence
I wole it telle  here in ȝoure presence
But worschepful Chanony relygious
Ne demyth nat that I slaudere ȝoure hous
Al thow myn tale of a chanoun be
Of euery ordere sum schrewe is pardee
That god forbede that al a cumpayny
Schulde rewe a synguler manys foly
To slaundere ȝow is nothyng myn entent
But to correcte that is mys Iment
  
This tale was nat only told for ȝow
But for othere mo ȝe wete wel how
That amongis cristis apostellis twelwe
There was no traytour but Iudas hym selue
Thanne why schulde the remenaunt han blame
That gilteles were  be ȝow seye I the same
Saue only this ȝif ȝe wele herkene me
If ony Iudas in ȝoure couent be
Remeuyth hym be tymys I ȝow rede
If schame or los may causen ony drede
And beth nothyng displesid I ȝow preye
But in this cas herkenyth what I schal seye
 In lundene was a prest an annueler
That therin dwellede hadde manye a ȝer
Whiche was so plesaunt and so seruysable
Vnto the wif where as sche was at table
That sche wolde suffere hym no thyng for to paye
ffor bord ne clothing wente he neuere so gaye
And spendynge siluyr hade he righ Inow
Therof no fors I wele procede as now
And telle forth myn tale of the Chanoun
That brougte this prest to confusioun
 This false Chanoun cam vp on a day
Vnto this prestis chaumbere where he lay
Besekynge him to lenyn hym a certeyn  
Of gold and he wolde quite it hym ageeyn
Lene me a mark quod he but dayis thre
And at myn day I wele it quytyn the
And If so be that thow me fynde fals
Anothir day do hange me by the hals
 This man hym tok a mark and that aswythe
And this chanoun hym thankede ofte sythe
And tok his leue and wente forth his weye
And at the thredde day broughte his monye
And to the prest tok his gold ageyn
Wherof this prest was wondir glad and fayn
  
Certis quod he no thyng anoyeth me
To lene a man a nobele or to or thre
Or what thyng were in myn possessioun
Whan he so trewe is of condicioun
That in nowise he breke wele his day
To swich a man I can neuere seyn nay
 What quod this chanoun schulde I be ontrewe
Nay that were a thyng Ifalle were al of newe
Trouthe is a thyng that I wele euere kepe
Vnto that day In whiche that I schal crepe

Beleueth þis as sykere as ys youre crede  
God thanke I and in good tyme be it seyd
That there was neuere man ȝit euele apayed
ffor gold ne siluyr that he to me sente
Ne neuere falshed in myn herte I mente
And sere quod he now of myn pryuyte
Syn ȝe godly han ben on to me
And kythed to me so gret gentillesse
Sumwhat to kythe with ȝoure kyndenesse
I wele ȝow schewe and ȝif ȝow lyste to lere
I wele ȝow teche pleynly the manere
How I can werke in philosophie
Takith good hed ȝe schul wel sen at Iȝe
That I wele don a maystrie er I go
 Ȝe quod the prest  ȝe sere and wele ȝe so
Marie therof I preye ȝow hertely
At ȝoure comaundement trewely
Qud the chanoun and ellis god forbeede  
Lo how this thef coude his seruyse bede
fful soth it is that swich profered seruyse
Stynkyth as wytnesseth these olde wise
And that ful sone I wele it veryfye
In this chanoun rote of alle trecherye
That eueremore delit hath and gladnesse
Sweche fendely thouȝtis in his herte inpresse
  
How cristis peple he may to myschef brynge
God kepe vs from his false dissymulynge
 Not wiste this prest with hom that he delte
Ne of his harm comynge he no thyng felte
O sely prest o sely innocent
With coueytyse anon thow schat ben blent
O graceles ful blynde is thyn conceyte
No thyng art thow war of the disseyte
Whiche that this fox Ischapyn hat to thee
Hise wyly wrenchis  thow ne mayst not fle
Wherfore to the conclusioun
That referith to thyn confusyoun
Vnhappi man anon I wele me hie
To tellyn thyn vnwit and heigh folye
And ek the falsenesse of that othir wreche
As fer forth as that myn conyng wele streche
 This Chanoun was myn lord ȝe wolden wene
Sire hust in feyth and by the heuenys queene
It was a nothir Chanoun and not he
That can an hunderede fold more subtylete
He hath betrayed folkis sundery tyme
Of his falsenesse it dullyth me to ryme
Euere whan that I speke  of his falshede
ffor schame of hym mynne chekis waxen reede
Algatis they begynne for to glowe
ffor rednesse haue I non righ wel I knowe
In myn visage for fumys dyuerse
Of metallis whiche as ȝe han herd me reherse
Consumyd and wastid han myn rednesse
Now tak bed of this Chanounnys curssedenesse
Sere quod he to the prest let ȝoure man gon  
ffor quik siluyr that we hadde it anon
And lat hym bryngyn ouuncis two or thre
And whan he comyth as faste schul ȝe se
A wondyr thyng whiche ȝe say neuere er this
 Sere quod the prest it schal ben don Iwis
  
He bad his seruaunt  fechyn hym this thyng
And he al redy was at his bedyng
And wente hym forth and cam anon ageyn
With this quik syluyr sotly for to seyn
And tok these ouncis thre to the Chanoun
And hem leyde fayre and weel a doun
And bad the seruaunt colis for to brynge
That he anon myght go to hese werkynge
The colis right anon weren Ifet
And this Chanoun tok out a croslet
Of his bosum and schewed it the prest
This instrument wheche that thow sest
Take in thyn hand  and put thyn self therinne
Of this quiksiluir 
In name of cryst to wexe a philysophere
There ben but fewe to whiche that I wolde profere
To schewyn hem thus meche of myn science
ffor ȝe schul sen here be experience
That this quik siluyr I wele mortifye
Rygh in ȝoure sighte anon withoutyn lye
And make it as good siluer and as fyn
As there is ony in ȝoure pors or myn
Or ellis where and make it malliable
And ellis heldith me fals and vnstable
Amongis folk for euere to appere
 I haue a poudere here that coste me ful dere
Schal make al good for it is cause of al
Myn kunnyng whiche that I ȝow schewe schal
Voydith ȝoure man and lat hym be ther oute
And schet the dore whil we ben aboute
Oure pryuyte that no man vs espye
Whilis that we werke in this philosephie
Al as he bad fulfyld was in dede  
This ilke seruaun anon ryght out ȝeede
And his maystyr schette the dore anon
And to here labour spedyly they gon
  
This prest at this chanonys biddyg
Vpon the fer anon sette this thyng
And blew the fuyr and besiede hym ful faste
And this chanoun into the croslet caste
A poudere not I wherof that it was
Imad othir of chalk othir of glas
Or sumwhat ell  was nat worth a flye
To blynde with this prest and bad hym hye
The colis for to couche al aboue
The croslet for in tokenynge I the loue
Quod the chanoun thynne owene handis two
Schul werche alle thynge whiche that schal here be do
Graunt mercy quod the prest and was ful glad
And couchede cole as that the chanoun bad
And whil he besi was this fendeli wreche
This false chanoun the foule fend hym feche
Out of his bosum tok a bechene cole
In which ful subtily was mad an hole
And there in was put of siluyr lymayle
An ounce and stoppid was withoutyn fayle
This hole with wex to putte the lymayl in
And vndyrstondith that this false gyn
Was not mad there but it was mad byfore
And othere thyngis that I schal telle more
Here aftyrward which that he with hym broughte
Er he cam ther hym to begile he thoughte
And so he dede er than they wente a twynne
Til he hadde ternede hym coude he not blynne
It dullede me whan I of hym speke
On his falsehed fayn wolde I be wreke
Ȝif I wiste how but he is her and ther
He is so varyaunt he abit nower
But takyth hed seris now for godis lowe
He tok his cole of which I spak aboue
And in his hand he bar it pryuyly  
And whilis the prest couchede besili  
The colis as I tolde ȝow er this
This chanoun seyde frend ȝe don amys
This is nat couched as it oughte be
But sone I schal amendyn it quod he
Now lat me medle therewith but a while
ffor of ȝow haue I pete be seynt gyle
ȝe been rygh hot I se wel how ȝe swete
Haue here a cloth and wipe awoy the weete
And whilis that the prest wipede his face
This chanoun tok his cole with sory grace
And leyde aboue vp on the mydward
Of the croslet and blew wel aftyrward
Til that the colys begynne faste brenne
Now ȝeue vs drynke quod the Chanoun thānne
As swythe al schal be wel I vndirtake
Sitte we doun and lat vs merye make
And whan that this chanonys bechene cole
Was brent al the lemayle out of the hole
Into the croslet fyl anon adoun
And so it muste nedis be resoun
Syn it so euene aboue couchede was
But therofne wyste the prest allas
He demede alle the colis lyche goode
ffor of the sleyghte he nothyng vndyrstode
And whan this alcamystre saw his tyme
Rise vp quod he sere prest and stand by me
And for I wot weel Ingot haue ȝe non
Goth walkyth forth and bryngeth a chalk ston
ffor I wele make it of the same schap
That is an Ingot  ȝif I may han hap
And brynge ek with ȝow a bolle or a panne
fful of watyr and ȝe schul wel se thanne
How that oure besynesse schal thryue and preue
And ȝit for ȝe schal han non mysbeleue
Ne wrong conceite of me in ȝoure absence
I wele not ben out of ȝoure presence
  
But gon with ȝow and come with ȝow ageyn  
The chambere dore schortly for to seyn
They openede and schette and wente here weye
And forth with hem they caryedyn the keye
And come ageyn withoutyn ony delay
What schulde I taryen al the longe day
He tok the chalk and schop it in the wise
Of an Ingot as I schal ȝow deuyse
I seye he tok out of his owene sleue
A teyne of syluyr euele mote he cheue
Whiche that ne was but an ounce of weighte
And taketh hed now of his owene sleighte
He schop his Ingot in lenthe and in breede
Of this teigne withoutyn ony drede
So slyly that the prest it nat espide
And in his sleue anon he gan it hide
And from the fuyr he tok vp his mater
And in the Ingot put it with merye cheer
And in the watyr vessel he it caste
Whan that hym leste and bad the prest as faste
Loke what there is put in thyn hand and grope
Thow fynde schalt there syluyr as I hope
What deuyl of helle schulde it ellis be
Schauynge of syluyr syluyr is parde
 He put his hand in and tok vp a teyne
Of silluyr fyn and glad in euery veyne
Was this prest whan he seyg that it was so
Goddis blyssyngis and hise moderis also
And alle halwis haue the sere chanoun
Seyde the prest and I here malysoun
But and ȝe vouchen saf to techyn it me
This nobelle craft and this sotylete
I wele been ȝoure in al that euere I may
 Quod the chanoun ȝit wele I make asay
The secunde tyme that ȝe may takyn hede
And been expert of this  and in ȝoure nede
  
Anothir day assay in myn absence
This disciplyne and this crafty science
Let take anothir vnce quod he tho  
Of quyk siluyr withoutyn wordis mo
An do therwith as ȝe han don er this
Whith that othyr which that now syluyr is
 The prest hym besyed in al that euere he can
To doon as this Chanoun this cursede man
Comaundede hym and faste blew the fyr
ffor to come theffect of his desyr
And this chanoun rygh in the meene while
Al redy was this prest eft to begyle
And for a cuntenaunce in his hand he bar
An holmene stikke  taak keepe and be war
In the ende of which an ounce and nomore
Of silvir lemail put was as byfore
Was in his cole  and stoppid with wex weel
ffor to kepe in his lymayl euerydel
And whil the prest was in his besynesse
This chanoun with his stikke gan hym dresse
To hym anon and his poudere caste in
As he dede er the deuyl out of his skyn
Hym turne I preye to god for his falsehede
ffor he was euere fals in thought and dede
And with this stikke aboue the Croslet
That was ordeynyd with that false Iet
He styre the colis til relente gan
The wex aȝen the fer as euery man
But it a fol be wot wel it mot neede
And al that in the stikke was out ȝede
And in the croslet hastyliche it fel
 Now goode sere what wele ȝe bet than weel
Whan that this prest was begiled ageyn
Supposynge nought but trouthe sothe to seyn
He was so glad that I can not expresse
In no manere his trouthe and his gladnesse
  
And to the Chanoun he proferede eft sone
Body and good ȝe quod the Chanoun sone
Thow pore I be crafty thow schat me fynde
I warne the ȝit is there more behynde 
Is there 2ony copyr  herinne seyde he2  
ȝa quod the prest  sere I trowe wel there be
Ellis go beye vs sum and that aswythe
Now goode sere go thyn wey an hithe
He wente his wey and with this coper cam
And this chanoun it in his handis nam
And of that copar weyed vp but an ounce
Al to symple is myn tunge to pronounce
As mynystre of myn wit the doubilnesse
Of this Chanoun rote of alle cursedenesse
He semede frendely to hem that knewyn hym not
But he was feenly bothe in werk and thouȝt
It deryeth me to telle of his falsenesse
And neuer the les ȝit wele I it expresse
To the entent that men may be war therby
And for non othir cause trewely
 He putte his Ounce of copir in the croslet
And on the fer aswythe he hath it set
And cast in poudyr and made the prest to blowe
And in his werkyng for to stoupe lowe
As he dede er and al was but a Iape
Rygh as hym lyste the prest he made
And aftyrward in the Ingot it caste
And in the panne put it as the laste
Of watyr  and in he putte his owene hand
And in his sleue as ȝe beforynhand
Herde me telle he hadde a syluyr teyne
He slyly tok it out this cursede heyne
Vnwetynge this prest of this false craft
And in the pannys boteme he hath it laft
And in the watyr roumbelynge to and fro
And wondyr pryuyly tok vp also
  
The copyr teyne nought knowynge this prest
And hedde it and hym hente by the brest
And to hym spak and thus seyde in his game

sToupith adoun by god ȝe be to blame
Helpith me now as I dede ȝow whil er
Put in ȝoure Hand and lokyth what is ther
This prest tok vp the syluyr teyn anon  
Thanne seyde the chanoun lat hym gon
With these thre teynys 2which thatwe han wrought2
To sum gold smyth and loke ȝif they been ouȝt
ffor be myn feyth I nolde for myn hood
But ȝif there were siluyr fyn and good
And that aswithe preuyd schal 2it be2 
 Vnto the goldsmyth with these teynys thre
They wente and putte these teynys in asay
To fier and hamyr ne myghte no man sey nay
But that they were as hem oghte bee
 This sottede prest ho was gladdere than he
Was neuere brid gladdere aȝen the day
Ne nyghtyngale in the sesoun of may
Was neuere non that leste bet to synge
Ne lady lustiere in carolynge
Or for to speke of loue and womanhede
Ne knyght in armys to don an hardy dede
To standyn in grace of his lady dere
Than hadde this prest this sory craft to lere
And to the Chanoun thus he spak and seide
ffor loue of god that for vs alle deyede
And as I may deserue it vnto ȝow
What schal this resceyt coste tellith me now
 By oure lord quod this Chanoun it is dere
I warne ȝow wel  for saue I and a frere
In  Ingelond there can no man it make
No fors quod he now sere for godys sake
What schal I paye tellith me I preye
Iwis quod he it is wol deere I seye
  
Sire at on word ȝif that ȝow leste it haue
Ȝe schul paye fourty pound so god me saue
And nere the frenchepe that ȝe dede er this
To me ȝe schuldyn paye more Iwis
This prest the summe of fourty pound anon
Of noblis fette and tok hem euerichon
To this Chanun for this ilke resseit
Al his werkyng was but fraude and disseid
Sire prest quod he  I kepe to han no loos  
Of myn craft for I wolde it kept weere clos
And as ȝe loue me kepith it secre
ffor and men knewyn al myn subtilete
By god they woldyn haue so gret enuye
To me by cause of myn philosophie
I schulde been deed there were non othir weye
God it forbede quod the prest what seyȝe
ȝit hadde I leuere to spendyn al myn good
Whiche that I haue and ellis wexe I wood
Than that ȝe schuldyn fallyn in swich myschef
ffor ȝoure goode wil sere haue ȝe rygh good pref
Quod the chanoun and farewel graunt mercy
He wente his wey and neuere the prest hym sey
Aftyr that day and whan the prest schulde
Makyn assay at swych tyme as he wolde
Of this resseit farewel it wolde not be
Lo thus beIapid and begiled was he
Thus made he his introductioun
To brynge folk to distruccioun
 Considerith seris  how that in eche estat
Bytwixe men and gold there is debat
So fer forth that onethis is there non
This multiplyinge thus blent manyon
That in good fey I trowe that it be
The cause grettest of swich skarsete
Philisopheris spekyn so mystily
In this craft that men may not come therby
  
ffor ony with that men han now on dayis
They mowe weel cheteryn as don Iayis
And in here termys sette here lust and peyne
But to here purpos schul they neuere atteyne
A man may lightely lerne ȝif he haue ought
To multyplye and turne his good to noght
Lo swich a lukere is in this lusty game
A manys murthe it wolde turne into grame
And emptyn grete and heuy pursis
And makyn folk for to purchase cursis
Of hem that han here good thereto Ilent  
O fy for schame they that han been brent
Allas can they nat flen the feris hete
ȝe that it vse I rede ȝe it lete
Lest ȝe lese al  for bet than neuere is late
Neuere to thryue were to longe a date
Thow ȝe prolle ay ȝe schul it neuere fynde
ȝe been as bold as is bayard the blynde
That blunderith forth and peril castyth non
He is as bold to renne ageyn a ston
As for to gon besydis in the weye
So fare ȝe that multyplie I seye
ȝf that ȝoure eye can not seen a ryght
Loke that ȝoure mynde lakke not ȝoure sight
ffor thow ȝe loke neuere so broode and stare
ȝe schul no thyng wynne on that chaffare
But waste al that ȝe may rape and renne
Withdrawe the fuyr lest it to faste brenne
Medelyth no more with that art I meene
ffor ȝif ȝe don ȝoure thrift is goon ful cleene
And rygh aswithe I wele ȝow tellyn heere
What that ȝe philisopheris seyn in this mateere
 Lo thus seyth arnold of the newe toun
As his rosarie makyth mencyoun
He seyth riȝt thus withoutyn ony lye
Theere may no man Mercurye mortifye
  
But ȝif it be with his brotheris knowelechyng
How that he  which that fyrst seyde this thing
Of philosopheris fadir was  hermes
He sey how that he dragoun douteles
Ne deyeth nat but ȝif that he be slayn
With his brothir and that is for to sayn
By dragoun mercurye and non othir
He vndyrstod and brymston by his brothyr
That out of sol and luna weere Idrawe
And therfore tak heed  seyde he to myn sawe
Lat no man besye this art for to seche
But ȝif that he thentencioun and speche
Of philisopheris vndyrstonde can  
An ȝif he do he is a lowede man
ffor this science and this cunnynge quod he
Is of the secre of the secretis parde
 Also there was a disciple of plato
That on a tyme he seyde his maystir to
As his bok Senyor wele bere witnesse
And this was his demaunde in sothfastnesse
Teelle me the name of the pryue stoon
And plato answerde vnto hym anoon
Take the ston that Titanos men name
Whiche is that quod he Magnasia is the same
Seyde plato ȝa syre and is it thus
This is ignotum per ignocius
What is magnacia goode sere I ȝow preye
 It is a watyr that is mad I seye
Of elementis foure quod Plato
Telle me the rooche goode sire quod he tho
Of that watyr ȝif that it be ȝoure wil
Nay nay quod plato serteyn that I nyl
 The philisopheris sworn were euerichon
That they schulde discouere it on to non
Nor in the bok it write in no manere
ffor on to cryst it is so lef and deere
  
That he wele not that it discouered be
But wheere it likyth to his deitee
Men for to enspire and ek for to defende
Whom that hym likith lo this is the ende
Thanne conclude I thus syn that god of heuene
Ne wele not that the philisopheris neuene
How that a man schal come vnto this stoon
I rede as for the beste lat it gon
ffor ho so makyth good his aduersarye
As for to werkyn ony thyng In contrarye
Of his wil sertis neuere schal he thryue
Thow that he multyplie terme of lyue
And there a poynt for endit is myn tale
God sende euery trewe man bote of his bale
WOte ȝe not where there stant a lityl toun
Which that Iclepid is Bobbe vp and doun
Vndyr the ble in Cauntyrbury weye
Theere gan oure ost for to Iape and pleye
And seyde seris what doun is in the myre
Is there no man for preyere ne for hire
That wole awake oure felawe here behynde
A thef myghte ful lightely hym robbe and bynde
Se how he nappith so how for Cokkis bonys
That he wele falle from his hors at onys
Is that a cok of lundene with myschaunce
Do hym come forth he knowith his penaunce
ffor he schal telle a tale be myn fey
Al thow it be not worth a botel hey
Awake thow cok quod he god ȝeue the sorwe
What eylith the to slepe by the morwe
Hast thow had flen al nyght or art thow dronke
Or hast thow with sum quene al nyght Iswonkyn
So that thow mayst nat holdyn vp thyn hed
This cok that was ful pale and no thing red
Seyde to oure hoost so god me blysse
As there is fallyn on me swich heuynesse
Not I not why that me were leuere slepe
Than the beste galoun wyn in chepe
  
 Wel quod the Maunciple ȝif it may doon ese
To the sere Cook and to no whight displese
Whiche that here rydyth in this cumpaynye
And that oure host wele of his curteysye
I wele as now excuse the of thyn tale
ffor in good fey thyn visage is ful pale
Thynne eyne daswe ek as that me thynkith
And weel I wot thyn breth ful soure stynkith
That schewith weel thow art nat weel disposed  
Of me certeyn thow schalt nat been Iglosed
Se how he ganyth lo this dronkene wight
As thow he wolde swelwe vs anoon right
Hold clos thyn mouth man by thyn fadyr kyn
The deuyl of helle set his foot ther in
Thyn cursede breth wele enfecte vs alle
ffy stynkynge swyn fy foule mote the befalle
A takyth hede seris of this lusty man
Now swete seris wole ȝe Iuste at the fan
Thereto me thynkyth ȝe been weel Ischape
I trowe that ȝe dronkyn han wyn ape
And that is whan men pleyen with a straw
And with his speche the Cook wex wroth and wraw
And on the Manciple he gan nodde faste
ffor lak of speche and doun the hors hym caste
Wheere as he lay tyl that the hym vp tok
This was a fayr chiuache of a cook
Allas ne hadde holde hym bi his ladil
And er that he ageyn were in his sadil
Theere was greet schowyng  bothe two and fro
To lyfte hym vp and meche care and wo
So vnwery was this sorye pallede gost
And to the mauncyple thanne spak oure hoost
Bycause drynk hat dominacioun
Vpon this man by myn saluacioun
I trowe lewedely he wolde telle his tale
ffor were it wyn or old  or moysti ale
  
That he hath dronkyn he spekyth in his nose
And sneseth faste and ek he hath the pose
He hath also to don moore than Inogh
To kepe hym and his capil out of the slow
And If he falle from his capil eft sone
Thanne schal we alle han Inogh to done
To liftyn vp his heuy dronkene cors
Telle on thyn tale of hym make I no fors
 But ȝit Manciple In feyth thow art to nyce
Thus opynly repreue hym of his vyce
Anothir day he wele parauenture  
Reclayme the and brynge the to loure
I mene he speke wele of smale thyngis
As for to pynche at thynne rekenyngis
That were nat onest ȝif that it come to pref
 No quod the Manciple that were a greet myschef
So myght he lyghtely brynge me in the snare
Ȝit hadde I leuere payen for the mare
Whiche he rit on than he schulde with me stryue
I wele nat wrathe hym also mote I thyrue
That that I spak I seyde but in borde
And wete ȝe weel I haue heere in a gorde
A draght of wyn ȝa of a ripe grape
And right anoon ȝe schul seen a good Iape
This cok schal drenke therof If I may
Vp peyne of deth he wele nat sey me nay
And certeynly to tellyn as it was
Of this vessel this Cook drank faste allas
What nedith hym he drank Inow byforn
And whan he hadde poupid in this horn
To the manciple he tok the gorde ageyn
And of that drenk the Cook was wondyr fayn
And thankede hym in swich wyse as he coude
Thanne gan oure hoost to laghe wondyr loude
And seyde I se weel it is necessarie
Wheere that we goon  we good drynk 1with vs carie1  
ffor that wele turne rancour and disese
To acord and loue and manye a wrong appese
O Bacus Iblyssede 1be thyn name1
That so canst turne ernest into game
Worchipe and thank be to thyn deite
Of that matiere ȝe gete namore of me
Telle on thyn tale manciple I the preye
Weel sere quod he herkenyth what I schal seye
WHan phebus dwellede heere in this erthe adoun
As olde bokys makyn mencioun
He was the moste lusti bacheleere
In al this world and ek the beste archere
He slow Phitoun the serpent as he lay
Slepynge ageyn the sunne vpon a day
And manye a nothir noble worthi dede
He with his bowe wroughte as ȝe may rede
Pleeyen he coude on euery menstrelsye
And syngyn that it was a melodye
To heryn of his cleere voys the soun
Sertis the kyng of thebes Amphioun
That with his syngyng wallede that cete
Koude neuere syngyn half so wel as he
Therto he was the semylyeste man
That is or was sithe that the world began
What nedith it hise feturis to discryue
ffor in this world was non so fayr on lyue
He was therwith fulfyld of gentylesse
Of honour and of parfyt worthynesse
 This phebus that was flour of bachillerie  
As wel in fredom as in chyualrye
ffor his disport in signe ek of victorye
Of phitoun so as tellyth vs the storye
Was wont to beryn in his hand a bowe
 Now hadde this phebus in his hous a  Crowe
Whiche in a cage he fosterede manye a day
And taughte it speke as men teche a Iay
  
Whit was this crowe as is a snow whit swan
And countyrfetid the speche of euery man
He coude whan he schulde telle a tale
Therwith in al this world non nyghtynghale
Ne coude by an hunderede thousent deel
Syngyn so wondir meryely and weel
 Now hadde this phebus in his hous a wyf
Whiche that he louede moore than his lyf
And nyght and day dede euere his diligence
Hire for to pleese and don hire reuerence
Saue only the sothe that I schal sayn
Ialus he was and wolde haue kep here fayn
ffor hym were loth byiapid for to bee
And so is euery wight in swich degre
But al in ydyl for it auaylyth noght
A good wif that is slene in werk and thought
Schulde not been kept in noon awayt certeyn
And trewely the labour is in veyn
To kepe a schrewe for it wele nat bee
This holde I for a verray vanytee
To spille labour for to kepe wivis
Thus wrytyn olde clerkis in here lyuys
But now to purpos as I ferst began
This worthi phebus doth al that he can
To plesyn here  wenynge that sweche plesaunce
And for his manhede and hise gouernaunce
That no man schulde haue put hire from hire grace
But god it wot there may no man enbrace
As to discryue a thyng  whiche that nature
Hath naturelly set in a cryature
 Take any thyng and put it in a cage  
And do al thyn entent and thyn corage
To fostere it tenderely with mete and drynk
Of alle deynteis that thow canst bethynk
And keepe it also clenly as thow may
Al thow his cage of gold be neuere so gay
  
ȝit hath this bryd be twenty thousend fold
Leuere in a forest that is· rude and cold
Gon ete wermys and sweche wrechedenesse
ffor euere this bryd wele doon his busynesse
To escapyn out of his cage ȝif he may
His lyberte this brid desiryth ay
 Lat take a Cat and fostere hym weel with mylk
And tendere flesch and make his couche of silk
And lat hym seen a mous goon by the wal
Anon he weyvith Milk and flesch and al
And eueri deynte that is in that hous
Swich apetit hath he  to ete a mous
Loo heere hat lust his dominacioun
And apetit flemyth discrecioun
 A sche wolf hath also a dyuers kynde
The lewedeste wolf that sche may fynde
Or lest of reputacioun that wele sche take
In tyme whanne hire lust to han a make
 Alle these ensaumplis speke I by these men
That been ontrewe and no thyng by wemen
ffor men han euere a lykerous apetit
On lowere thyng to parfornyn here delyt
Than on here wyuys ben they neuere so fayre
Ne neuere so trewe ne neuere so debonayre
fflesch is so newefangil with myschaunce
That we ne cunne in nothyng han plesaunce
That sounyth into wertew ony whyle
This phebus which that thoughte on no gyle
Disceyuede was for al his Iolyte
ffor vndyr hym anothir hadde sche
A man of litil reputacioun
Not worth to phebus in comparisoun
The more harm is it ofte happith so  
Of whiche there comyth meche harm and wo
And so befel that phebus was absent
His wif anon hath forth his leman sent
  
Hire leman Certis this is a knauych speche
fforȝeuyth it me and that I ȝow beseche
The wyse plato seyth as ȝe may reede
The word mote nede acorde with the dede
ȝif men schal telle propirly a thyng
The word mot Cosyn be to the werkyng
I am a boystoūs man ryght thus seye I
Theere is no differens trewely
Betwixe a wyf that is of high degre
Ȝif of hire body disonest sche be

If it so be thei wirke bothe a mys  
But that the gentile in hire stat aboue
Sche schal be clepid his lady as in loue
And for that othir is a pore woman
Sche schal be clepid his wenche or his lemman
And god it wot myn owene deere brothir
Men leyn that on as as lowe  as lyth that othir
 Righ so bytwixe a titeleles tyraunt
And an outlawe or a thef erraunt
The same I seye there is no difference
To alysaundere was told this sentence
That for the tyraunt is of grettere myght
By force of meyne for to slen doun ryght
And brennyn hous and hom and make al pleyn
Lo therfore is he clepid a capitayn
 And for the outlawe hat but smal meyne
And may not doon so gret an harm as he
Ne brynge a cuntre to so greet myschif
Men clepe hym an outlawe or a thef
But for I am a man not textuel
I wele not telle of textys neuere a del ·
I wele go to myn tale as I began
Whan Phebus wif hath sent for hire leman
Anon they wroughtyn al here lust volage
The white Crowe that heng ay in the cage
  
Beheld here werk and seyde neuere a word  
And whan that hom was come Phebus the lord
This Crowe song Cokhow cokhow cokhow
 What brid quod Phebus what song syngist thow
Ne were thow wone so meryely to synge
That to myn herte it was a reioysynge
To here thyn voys allas what Ioye is this
By god quod he I synge nat amys
Phebus quod he for al thyn worthynes
ffor al thyn beute and thyn gentiles
ffor al thyn song and thyn menstralsye
ffor al thyn waytyng blered is thyn eye
With on of lytyl reputacioun
Nogh worth to the in computacioun
The mountenaunce of a gnatte so mot I thryue
ffor on thyn bed thyn wif I saw hym swyue
What wele ȝe more the crowe anon hym tollde
By sadde tokenys and bi wordis bolde
How that his wif hadde doon hire lecherye
Hym to gret schame and to greet vilenye
And tolde hym oftyn he saw it with hise yen
 This Phebus gan awoyward for to wryen
And thoute his sorweful herte brast ato
His bowe he bente and sette therin a flo
And in his yre his wif thanne hath he slayn
This is theffect there is no more to seyn
ffor sorwe of which he brak his menstrelcie
Bothe harpe and lute geterne and sauterye
And ek he brak hise arwis and his bowe
And aftyr that thus spak he to the crowe
 Traytour quod he with tunge of Scorpioun
Thow hast me brought to myn confusioun
Allas that I was wrought why nere I ded
O deere wyf o gemme of lustiheed
That were to me so sad  and ek so trewe
Now lyst thow deed  with face pale of hewe

O rakele hand to don so foule amys
O troubele wit O yre recheles  
That on auysid smytist gilteles
 O wantrust ful of fals suspecioun
Where was thyn wit and thyn discrecioun
O eueri man be war of rakilnesse
Ne trowe no thyng withoute gret witnesse
Smyt nat to sore er than ȝe wetyn why
And beth auysed weel and sobirly

Vpon ȝoure yre for suspecioun
Allas a thousent folk han rakil yre

Allas for sorw I wele myn seluyn sle
And to the crowe o false thef quod he

Thow sunge whilhom lich a Nyghtyngale
Now schalt thow false thef thyn song forgon

Thus schal men on a traytour been awreke
Thow and thynne ospryng  Schul been blake
Ne neuere swete noyse schul ȝe make
But euere crye aȝen tempest and reyn
In tokenynge that thour the myn wif is slayn
And to the Crowe he styrte and that anon
And pullede hise white federis euerychon
And made hym blak and raft hym al his song
And ek his speche and out ate dore hym slong
Vnto the devil whiche I hym betake
And for this cas been alle crowis blake
 Lordyngis by this exsaumple I ȝow preye
Beth war and takyth kep what that I seye
Ne tellyth neuere no man In ȝoure lyf
How that a nothir man hath dyght his wyf

Daun Salomon as wise clerkis seyn
Techith a man to kepe his tunge weel
But as I seyde I ne am not tixtuel
But natheles that taughte me myn dame  
 Myn sone thynke on the Crowe a godis name
Myn sone kep weel thyn tunge and kep thyn frend
A wekede tunge is werse than a feend
Myn sone from a feend men may hem blysse
Myn sone god of his endeles goodnesse
Wallede a tunge with teth and lippis ek
ffor man schulde hym avise what he spek
Myn sone ful ofte for to meche speche
Hath manye a man been spilt as clerkis teche
But for lytil speche auysely
I no man schent to speke generally
Myn sone thyn tunge schuldist thow restreyne
At alle tymys but whan thow dost thyn peyne
To speke of god in honour and preyere
 The fyrste vertu sone ȝif thow wilt leere
Is to restreyne and kepe weel thyn tunge
Thus lernede childeryn whan that they ben ȝonge
Myn sone of mekyl spekynge euele avysed
There lasse spekynge hadde Inow suffised
Comyth meche harm it was me told and taught
In mechil speche synne wantyth naught
Wist thow whrof rakyl tunge seruyth

But he that hath mysseyd  I dare weel sen

Thow hym repente or be hym lef or loth

Of tydyngis whedyr they been false or trewe
Wheere so thow come amongis highe or lowe
Keek weel thyn tunge and think vpon the Crowe
BY that the Manciple hadde his tale Iendid
The sunne from the south lyne was descendid
So lowe that he ne was not to myn sight
Degreis nynne and twenty as in hight
Ten of the clok it was tho as I gesse
ffor eleuene fote or lytil more or lesse
Myn schadew was at tilke tyme as theere
Of swiche feet as in myn lenthe partede weere
In sexe feet equal of proporcyoun
Therwit the 1monys exaltacyoun1
I mene libra alwey gan assende
As we were enterynge at a thorpis ende
ffor which oure host as he was wone to gye
As in this cas this Ioly cumpaynye
Seyde in this wise lordyngis euerichon
Now lakkith vs no talys mo than on

That tellyth tis tale to vs lustily

Or art a Persoun sey soth by thyn fey

Vnbocle and schewe vs what is in thi male

Thou schuldist knyt vp well a gret matere
Telle vs a fable anon for cockis bones
This Person answerde all at ones
Thou getist fable non ytolde for me

Repreuyth hem that waifen sothfastnesse
And tellen fablis and suche wrecchidnesse
Whi schulde I schewen draf out of my feste
When I maie schewe whete if that me leste

Moralite and vertuous matere
And then that ye wolen ȝeue me audience

Don you plesaunce leefull as I can
But trustith well I am a sothryn man
I can noght geste rom ram ruf bi lettre
Ne god woot rym holde I but litell bettre
And therfore if you list I woll noght glose
I woll you telle a merye tale in prose
To knyt vp all this feste and make an ende
And ihesu for his grace witt me sende  
To schewe you the weie in this viage
Of thilke parfite glorious pilgrymage
That hight hierusalem celestiall
And if ye vouche saf anon ye schall
Begynne vp on my tale for whiche I preie
Telle your avys I can no better seie
But natheles this meditacion

Of clerkis for I am noght text well

Therfore I make protestacion
That I woll stonde to correccion
  
Vp on this word we han assentid sone
ffor as it semyd it was for to done
To endyn in some vertuous sentence
And for to yeue hym space and audience
And bad our Ost he schulde to hym seie
That alle we to telle his tale we preie
Our Ost had the wordis for vs alle
Sir preest quod he now faire mote you bifalle
Seie what you list and we schulen gladly here
And with that word he seide in this manere
Tellith quod he your meditacioun
But hasteth you the sonne woll adoun
Beth fructuous and that in litell space
And to do well god sende you his grace
But here of I wil passe as now  
And of ȝong Gamelyne I wil telle ȝou
The tale of ȝong Gamelyn
Erthen and listeneth and herkenyth a right
And shul here of a doughty knyght
Sir Iohan de Boundys was his name
He coude of norture and of mochel game
Thre sones þe knyght had and with his body hem wan
The eldest was a moche schrewe and sone he began
His brethren loued wel her fader and of hym were agast
The eldist disserued his fader curs and had it at þe last
The gode knyght his fader lyued so ȝore
That deth was comen hym to and handelid him ful sore
The gode knyght cared sore sike þere he lay
How his children shuld lyuen after his day
He had ben wide where but non husbond he was
Al þe londe þat he had hit was purchas
ffayn he wold hit were dressed among hem alle
That eche of hem hadde his part as it myght falle
Tho sente he in to cuntre after wise knyghtes
To helpen delen his londes and dressen hem to rightes
He sent hem word by lettres þai shuld hye blyue
Ȝif þei wold speke with him while he was on lyue


Tho þe knyghtes herden sike þat he lay
Had þey no rest nothir nyght ne day
Til þey come to him þere he lay stille
On his deth bed to abide goddes wille
Then seyde þe goode knyght sike þere he lay  
Lordes I ȝou warne for soþe withoute nay
I may no lenger lyuen here in þis stonde
ffor thorugh goddes wille deth drawes to gronde
Ther nas non of hem alle þat herde hem a right
That þey hadden reuthe of þat ilke knyght
And seiden sir for goddes loue ne dismay ȝou nouȝt
God may done bote of bale þat is now Iwrouȝt
Than spake þe gode knyght sike þere he lay
Bote of bale god may sende I wote it is not nay
But I beseche ȝou knyghtes for þe loue of me
Goth and dresseth my londes among my sones thre
And for þe loue of god delith not hem amys
And forȝeteþ not Gamelyn my ȝong sone þat is
Taketh hede to þat one as wel as to þat oþer
Selde ȝe seen any heire helpen his brother
Tho leten þey þe knyght lyen þat was not in hele
And wenten in to counseil his londis for to dele
ffor to delen hem alle to oon þat was her þoght
And for Gamelyn wast ȝongest he shuld haue nouȝt
Alle þe lond þat þer was þei dalten it in two
And leten Gamelyn þe ȝong withouten lond go
And eche of hem saide to other ful lowde
His brethren myght ȝeue hym lond when he good cowde
When þey had deled at her wille
They comen to þe knyght þer he ley stille
And tolde hym anon how þei had wrought
And þe knyght ther he lay likid it right nought
Than seyde þe knyght by seynt martyn
ffor al þat ȝe haue don ȝet is þe lond myn
ffor go goddes loue Neigboures stondith al stille
And I wil delen my lond right after my wille


Iohn my eldest sone shal haue plowes fyue
That was my fadres heritage while he was on lyue
And my mydlest sone fyue plowes of lond
That I halp for to gete with my right hond
And al myn oþer purchas of londes and ledes  
That I bequeeþe Gamelyn and alle my gode stedes
And I beseke ȝou good men þat law con of lond
ffor Gamelyns loue þat my quest stond
Thus dalt þe knyght his lond by his day
Right on his deth bed sike þere he lay
And sone aftirward he lay stoon stille
And died whan tyme come as it was cristes wille
Anone as he was deed and vnder gras graue
Sone þe elder broþer gyled þe ȝong knaue
He toke in to his honde and his lede
And Gamelyn him selfe to clothen and to fede
He cloþed hym and fedde hym yuel and eke wrothe
And lete him his londes forfare and his houses boþe
His parkes and his wodes and dide noþyng welle
And sithen he it abowȝt on his owne felle
So longe was Gamelyn in his brothers halle
ffor þe strengest of good wille þei doutenden alle
Ther was none þere in noþer ȝong ne old
That wold wrath Gamelyn where he neuer so bold
Gamelyn stode on a day in his brothers ȝerde
And bygan with his hand to hondel his berde
He þouȝt on his landes þat lay onsawe
And his faire okes þat doune were Idrawe
His parkes were broken and his dere reved
Of alle his good stedes noon was him byleued
His houses were vnhiled and ful euel dight
Tho þouȝt Gamelyn it went not a right
Aftirward came his brother walkyng þere
And seide to Gamelyn is oure mete ȝere
Tho wrathed him Gamelyn and swore by goodes booke
Thou shalt go bake þy self I wilnot be þi cooke


Now broþer Gamelyn hou vnswarest þou now
Thou spakkest neuer suche a word as þou dost now
By my feythe seide Gamelyn now me þynkith nede
Of alle þe armes þat I haue I toke neuer ȝet hede
My parkes ben broken and my dere byreved  
Of myn armes and my stedes noght is me byleued
Al þat my fader me quaþ al goth to schame
And þerfore haue goddes curs broþer by þyn name
Than spak his brother þat rape was of rees
Stand stille gadlyng and hold þy pees
Thou shalt fayne to haue þy mete and þy wede
What spekest þou gadlyng of lond or of lede
Than seide Gamelyn þe child þat was ȝyng
Cristes curs mote he haue þat clepith me gadlyng
I am no worse gadlyng ne no worse wight
But borne of a lady and geten of a knyght
Ne dirst he note to Gamelyn neuer a fote go
But clepid to him his men and saide to hem þo
Goth and bethet þis boy and reueth him his witte
And lette hym lerne an oþer tyme to vnsware me bette
Then seide þe child ȝong Gamelyn
Cristes curs mote þou haue brother art þou myn
And ȝif y shal algate be beten anoon
Cristes curs mote þou haue but þou be þat oon
Annoon his brother in þat grete hete
Made his men to fette staffes Gamelyn to bete
When euery of hem hed a staffe nomen
Gamelyn was ware tho he seigh hem comen
Tho Gamelyn seigh hem comen he lokid ouer all
And was war of a pestel stood vnder þe wall
Gamelyn was light and þider he can lepe
And droff alle his brothers men right sone on hepe
And lokid as a wild lyon and layde on gode wone
Tho his brother sei þat he bygan to gone
He fley vp in to a loft and shete þe dore fast
Thus Gamelyn with his pestel made hem alle agast


Some for Gamelyns loue and some for eye
Alle þey drowen hem to halues þoo he gan to flee
What now seide Gamelyn euel mote ȝe þe
Wille ȝe bygynne contyk and so sone flee
Gamelyn souȝt his brother whider he was flow  
And saughe where he lokid oute of a wyndow
Brother seyde Gamelyn come a litul nere
And I wille teche the a play at the bokeler
His brother him vnswarid and seide by seynt Richere
While þat pestel is in thi hond I wole come no nere
Brother I wil make thi pees I swere by crstes ore
Cast away þe pestel and wrath the no more
I moste nede saide Gamelyn wrath me at ones
ffor þou wold make þy men to breke my bones
Ne hadde I hadde mayn and myght in myn armes
To haue hem fro me thei wold haue do de harmes
Gamelyn saide his brother be þou not wroth
ffor to seen the haue harme me were right loth
I ne dede it nouȝt brother but for a fondyng
ffor to loken or þou art strong and art so ȝyng
Come a doune þen to me and graunt me my bone
Of o þyng I wil þe axe and we shul saught sone
Downe þan come his brother þat fekil was and felle
And was swich sore aferd of the pestell
He seide brother Gamelyn axe me þy bone
And loke þou blame but I it graunt sone
Than seide Gamelyn brother I was
And we shull be at one þou most graunt me þis
Alle þat my fader me byquaþ while þat he was on lyue
Thou moust do me it haue ȝif we shul not stryve
That shalt þou haue Gamelyn I swere by cristes ore
Alle þat fader þe bequaþ þough þou woldest haue more
Thi lond þat lith leye wel it shal be sowe
And þyn houses reised vp þat ben leide ful lowe
Thus seide þe knyght to Gamelyn with mouth
And þouȝt on falsenes as he wel couth


The knyght þought on treson an Gamelyn on none
And went and kissed his brother and whenne þey weren atone
Allas ȝong Gamelyn no þyng he ne wiste
With suche fals treson his brother hym kyste
Lyithenyth and lystnyth and holdith ȝoure tong  
And ȝe shul here talkyng of Gamelyn þe ȝong
Ther was ther be siden cried a wrastlyng
And ther for ther was sette a Ram and a ryng
And Gamelyn was in wille to wende þer to
ffor to preuen his myght what he coude do
Brother seid Gamelyn be seynt Richere
Thou most lene me to nyght a litel coursere
That is fressh to þe spores on for to ryde
I most on an Erand a litel here by side
Be god seide his broþer of stedes in my stalle
Go and chese the best spare non of hem alle
Of stedes and of coursers that stoden hem be side
And telle me gode brother whedir þou wilt ride
Here by side brother ys cried a wrastlyng
And þerfore shal be set a Ram an a ryng
Moche worship it were brother to vs alle
Might ȝe the ram and þe ryng bryngen home to þis halle
A stede þer was sadeled smertly and skete
Gamelyn did a paire of spores fast on his fete
He sette his foot in þe stirop þe stede he bystrood
And toward þe wrastlyng þe yong child rood
Tho Gamelyn þe yong was riden oute at gate
The fals knyght his brother lokid yit after þate
And bysouȝt ihesu crist þat is heuen kyng
He myght breke his nekke in þat wrastlyng
As sone as Gamelyn come þere the place was
He light doun of his stede on the gras
And ther he herde a frankeleyn weylaway synge
And bigan bitterly his hondes for to wrynge
Gode man saide Gamelyn whi makest þou þis fare
Is ther no man þat may ȝou helpen oute of care


Allas seide þis fankelyn þat euer y was bore
ffor twey stalworth sones I wene þat I haue lore
A Champyon is in þe place þat haþ wrouȝt me sorowe
ffor he hath slayn my two sones but ȝif god hem borowe
I wel ȝeue ten pound by ihesu crist and more  
With þe nones that I fonde a man to handle hym sore
Gode man seide Gamelyn wilt þou wel done
Hold my hors while my man drawith of my shone
And helpe my man to kepe my clothes and my stede
And I wil in to place gone to loke if y may spede
By god seyde the frankeleyn it shal be done
I wille my self be þy mane to draw of þy shone
And wende þou in to place ihesu crist the spede
And drede not of thi clothes ne of thi gode stede
Barfoot and vngirt Gamelyn In came
Alle þat were in þe place hede of him þei name
How he dorste auntre him to done his myght
That was so doughty a champion in wrastlyng and in fight
Vp sterte þe Champion rapely anone
Toward ȝong Gamelyn he bygan to gone
And seide who is þy fader and who is þy sire
ffor soþe þou art a grete foole þat þou come here
Gamelyn vnswarid þe Champion tho
Thou knew wel my fader while he couthe go
Whilis he was on lyue by seynt Martyn
Sire Iohan of Boundis was his name and I Gamelyn
ffelaw seide the Champion so mote I thryue
I knewe wel the fader whiles he was on lyue
And thi self Gamelyn I wil þat þou it here
While þou were a ȝong boy a moche schrew þou were
Than saide Gamelyn and swore by cristes ore
Now I am older wax þou shal fynde me a more
By god seyde þe Champion wel come mote þou be
Come þou ones in myn honde þou shalt neuer the
It was wel withinne nyght and þe mone shone
When Gamelyn and the Champion to gedre gon gone


The Champion cast tornes to Gamelyn þat was prest
And Gamelyn stode and bade hym done his best
Than seide Gamelyn to þe Champion
Thou art fast aboute to bryng me adon
Now I haue proued mony tornes of thyne  
Thow most he seide proue on or two of myne
Gamelyn to the Champion ȝede smertly anone
Of alle tornes þat he couthe he shewed hym but one
And kest hym on the lift side þat þre ribbes tobrake
And þerto his on arme þat ȝaf a grete crak
Than sayde Gamelyn smertly a none
Shal it be hold for a cast or ellis for none
By god seide þe Champion where it be
He þat comeþ ones in þy honde shal he neuer the
Than seide þe frankelyn þat had his sones þere
Blessed be þou Gamelyn þat euer þou bore were
The frankeleyn seide to the Champion on hym stood hym no eye
This is ȝon Gamelyn þat taught the þis pleie
Aȝen vnsward þe Champion þat liked no þyns wel
He is alther meister and his pleie is right felle
Sithen I wrastelet first it is gon ȝore
But I was in my lif handled neuer so sore
Gamelyn stode in the place anon withoute serke
And seide ȝif þer be mo let hem come to werke
The Champion þat payned hym to werke sore
Hit semeth by his contenance þat he wille nomore
Gamelyn in the place stoode stille as stoon
ffor to abide wrastlyng but þer come non
Ther was none with Gamelyn þat wold wrastle more
ffor he handlid þe Champyon so wonderly sore
To gentil men ȝemed þe place
Come to gamelyn god ȝyue hym gode grace
And seide to hym to on thi hosen and þi shone
ffor soþe at þis tyme þis faire is done
And þan saide Gamelyn so mote I wel fare
I haue not ȝet haluendel sold my ware


Tho seide þe Champion so brok I my swere
He is a fool þat þerof bief þou sillest it so dere
Thoo seide the frankeleyn þat was in moche care
ffelaw he seide why lakkist þou þis ware
By seynt Iame in Gales þat mony man hath sought  
Ȝit is it to good chepe þat þou hast bought
Tho þat wardeyns were of þat wrastlyng
Come and brouȝt Gamelyn þe Ram and þe ryng
    
    
And Gamelyn thouȝt it was a faire þyng
And went with moche Ioy home in þe mornyng
His broþer seie where he came with þe grete route
And bade shit þe gate and hold hym withoute
The porter of his lord was sore agaste
And stert anone to the gate and lokked it faste
Now lytþeþ and lysteneyth boþe yong and old
And ȝe shul he Gamyn of Gamelyn þe bold
Gamelyn come þerto for to haue comyn In
Than was it schet fast with a pyn
Than seide Gamelyn porter vndo þe ȝate
ffor gode mannys sone stond þer ate
Than answered þe porter and sware by goddes berd
Thou ne shalt Gamelyn come in to this ȝerd
Thou lixt seide Gamelyn so broke I my chyne
He smote the wiket with his foote and brake away þe pyne
The porter sey tho it myght no better be
He sette fote on erthe and bygan to flee
By my fey seide Gamelyn þat trauel is lore
ffor I am on fote as light as þou haddest it swore
Gamelyn ouer toke þe porter and his tene wrake
And girt him in the nekke þat þe boon tobrake
And toke him in his arme and threw hym in a welle
Vijc fadame it was depe I haue herd telle
Whan Gamelyn þe ȝong þus had plaide his plaie
Alle þat in the ȝerde were drowen hem awaye


They dredein hym fol sore for werke þat he wrought
And for þe faire companye þat he þedir brought
Gamelyn ȝede to þe ȝate and lete hit vp wide
He lete in alle þat gone old or ride
And seide ȝe be welcome withoute eny greue
ffor we wille be maisters here and axe no man leue
Ȝersterday I left  seyde ȝong Gamelyn  
In my broþer seller fyue tonne wyne
I wilnot þis companye parten on twyne
And ȝe wille don after me while sope ys þerinne
And ȝif my brother gruche or make foule chere
Other for spence of mete or drynke þat we spende here
I am oure Catour and bere oure alþer purse
He shal haue for his gruchyng seynt marie curse
My brother ys a nygon y swere by cristes ore
And we wille spende largely þat he hath spared ȝore
And who þat make gruchyng þat we here dwelle
He shal to porter in to þe drawe welle
Vij dayes and vij nyght  Gamelyn held his fest
With moche solace was there and none chest
In a litel torret his broþer ley steke
And sey hem wast his good and dorst not speke
Erly in a mornyng on the viij day
The gestes come to Gamelyn and wold gone her way
Lordes seide Gamelyn wil ȝe so hye
Alle þe wyne is not ȝet dronke so broke I myn eye
Gamelyn in his hert was ful wo
Whenne his gestes toke her leue fro hym for to go
He wold þey hadde dwelled lenger and þey seide nay
But bytauȝt Gamelyn god and goode day
Thus made Gamelyn his fest and brouȝt it wel to ende
And after his gestes to leue to wende
Lytheþ and lystenyth and holdeth ȝoure tonge
And ȝe shul here Gamen of Gamelyn þe ȝong
Herkenyth lordynges and lystenyth a right
Whenne alle gestes were gon how Gamelyn was dight


Alle þe while þat Gamelyn held his mangerie
His broþer þoght on hym be wreke with his trecherie
Tho Gamelyns gestis were riden and gone
Gamelyn stode anone allone frende hed he none
Tho after felle sone withIn a litul stonde
Gamelyn was taken and ful hard Ibonde
fforþ come þe fals knyght oute of þe solere  
To Gamelyn his broþer he ȝede ful nere
And saide to Gamelyn ho made þe so bolde
ffor to stroien my store of my householde
Brother seyde Gamelyn wrath the right noght
ffor it is mony day gone sith it was boght
ffor broþer þou last hadde by seynt Richere
Of xv plowes of lond þis sixtene ȝere
And of alle the bestis þou hast forþ bredde
That my fader me byquaþ on his deþ bedde
Of alle þis sixtene I ȝeue þe þe prowe
ffor þe mete and the drynke þat we haue spended now
Than sayde þe false knyght euyl mote he the
Herken broþer Gamelyn what I wil geve þe
ffor of my body brother here geten haue I none
I wil make the myn eyer I swere by seynt Iohan
Parfay saide Gamelyn and it so be
And þou þinkest as þou seist gold ȝeld it the
No thyng wist Gamelyn of his broþer gyle
Therfore he hym bygyled in a litul while
Gamelyn seide he oo þyng I þe telle
Tho thow threw my porter in þe drawe wel
I swor in þat wrath and in that grete moote
That þou shuldist be bond both hond and foote
    
    
    
ffor to holden my avou as I the behote
Brother seide Gamelyn as mote ȝe the
Þou shalt be forswore for the loue of me


Tho maden þei Gamelyn to sitte myght he not stonde
Til þey hadde him both foot and honde
The fals knyght his broþer of Gamelyn was agast
And sende after feters to feteren him fast
His broþer made lesynges on hym þer he stode
And tolde hem þat comen In þat Gamelyn was wode
Gamelyn stode to a post bonden in the halle
Tho that comen In  loked on hym alle
Euere stode Gamelyn euen vp right  
But mete and drynke had he none noþer day ne nyght
Than saide Gamelyn brothir by myn hals
Now I haue aspied þou art a party fals
Had I wist þe treson þat þou hast fond
I wold haue ȝeue strokes or I had be bond
Gamelyn stode stille bonde as eny stone
Two dayes and two nyghtes mete hadde he none
Than seide Gamelyn þat stode Ibonde strong
Adam spenser me þinkiþ I fast to long
Adam spenser now I beseche the
ffor þe moche loue my fader loued the
Ȝif þou may come to the keyes lese me out of bond
And I wil parte with the of my fre lond
Than seide Adam þat was þe spencer
I haue serued þy brother þis xvj ȝere
Ȝif I let the gon out of his beure
He wold saie afterward I were a traitour
Adam seide Gamelyn so brok I myn hals
Thou shalt fynd my broþer at þe last fals
Therfore broþer Adam lose me oute of bondes
And I wil parte with the of my fre londes
Vp suche forward seide Adam Iwis
I wil do þerto al þat in me is
Adam seide Gamelyn as mote I the
I wille hold þe couenaunt and þou wil me
Anone as Adams lord to bedde was gone
Adam toke þe keyes and lete Gamelyn oute anone


He vnloked Gamelyn boþe hondes and feete
In hope of auauncement þat he him behete
Than seide Gamelyn þankid be goddes sonde
Now I am lose boþe foote and hande
Hadde I now eten and dronken a right
Ther is none in this hous shuld bynde ne þis nyght
Adam toke Gamelyn as stille as eny stoon
And lad hym in to spense raply anone 
And sette hym to soper right in a priue stede  
He badde him do gladly adam so dide
Anon as Gamelyn had eten wel and fyne
And þerto Idronken wel of þe rede wyne
Adam seyde Gamelyn what is now þi rede
Or I go to my brother and gird of his hede
Gamelyn seid Adam it shal not be so
I con teche the a rede þat is worth þe two
I wote wel for soþe þat þis is no nay
We shul haue a mangery right on sonday
Abbotes and prioures mony here shal be
And oþer men of holy chirche as I telle the
Thou shalt stond vp by þe post as þou wer hond fast
And I shal leue hem vnloke þat away þou may hem cast
Whan þat þei haue eten and wasshen her hondis
Thou shalt biseke hem alle to bryng the oute of bondys
    
    
And if eche of hem say to vs nay
I shal do an oþer I swere by þis day
Thou shalt haue a gode staff I wil haue another
And cristes curs haue þat oon þat falith þat oþir
Ȝe for god seide Gamelyn I sey it for me
Ȝif I faile on my side euel mote I the
Ȝif we shul algate assoile hem of her synne
Warne me brother Adam whan we shul begynne
Gamelyn saide Adam by seynt charite
I wil warne the byforne whan it shal be


Whan I wynke on the loke for to goon
And caste away thy feders and come to me anoon
Adam seyd Gamelyn blessed be þy bones
That is a gode conseil ȝeuen for þe nones
Ȝif þey werne me to bryng þe oute of bondes
I wil sette gode strokes right on her lendes
Tho þe sonday was comen and folke to þe feste
ffaire þei were welcomed boþe lest and meste
And euere as þey at þe halle dore come Inne
They cast here eye on ȝong Gamelyn 
The fals knyght his brothir ful of trecherye  
Alle þe gestes þat þer were at þe mangerye
Of Gamelyn his brothir he told hem with mouthe
Alle þe harme and þe shame þat he telle couthe
Tho þei were Iserued of messes two or thre
Than seide Gamelyn how serue ȝe me
It is noght wel serued by god þat all made
That I sitte fastyng and oþer men make glade
The fals knyght his brother þer as he stoode
Told alle gestes that Gamelyn was woode
And Gamelyn stoode stille and vnswared noght
But Adams wordes he held in his þought
Tho Gamelyn gan speke deolfully with alle
To þe grete lordes þat saten in þe halle
Lordes he saide for cristes passion
Helpe to bryng Gamelyn oute of prison
Than saide an Abbot sorow on his cheke
He shal haue cristes curs and seynt maryes eke
That þe oute of prison beggeþ or borowe
But euer worth hym wel þat doþe þe moche sorowe
After þat abbot þan spake an oþer
I wold þyn heed were of þeigh þou were my brother
Alle þat þe borow foul mote hem falle
Thus þei saide alle þat were in the halle
Than saide a priour euel mote he preue
It is grete sorow and care boy þou art on lyue


Ow seide Gamelyn so broke I my bone
Now I haue spied þat frendes haue I none
Cursed mote he worth both flessh and blood
That euer doth abbot or priour eny good
Adam þe spense toke vp toke vp þe cloþe
And loked on Gamelyn and say þat he was wroth
Adam on þe pantrie litul he þought
    
Adam lokith on Gamelyn and he was war anone
And cast away þe feters and bygan to gone
Tho he come to Adam he toke þe on stafe
And bygan to worche and good strokes ȝafe
Gamelyn come in to the halle and þe spencer boþe  
And lokid hem aboute as þei hadde be wroþe
Gamelyn spreynyþ holiwater with a Oken spire
That some þat stood vp right fel in the fire
Ther was no lewed man þat in þe halle stode
That wolde do Gamelyn ony þing but gode
But stoden bisiden and leten hem boþe wirche
ffor þei hadde no rewth of men of holy chirche
Abbot or priour monk or chanoun
That Gamelyn ouertoke anoon þei ȝeden doun
Ther was noon of alle þat with his staff mette
That he made hem ouerthrow and quitte hem his dette
Gamelyn seide Adam for seint Charite
Paye gode lyueray for þe loue of me
And I wil kepe the dore so euere here I masse
Er þei ben assoyled ther shall noon passe
Doute þee nought seide Gamelyn while we ben in fere
Kepe þou wel þe dore and I wole worche heere
Bistere þee gode Adam and let ther noon fle
And we shull telle largely how many þat þer be
Gamelyn seide Adam do hem but gode
Thei ben men of hooly chirche drawe of hem no blode
Saue wel þe coroun and do hem no harmes
But breke bothe her leggis and sithen her armes


Thus Gamelyn and Adam wrought right fast
And playde with the monkes and made hem agast
Thider þei come ryding iolily with swaynes
And home aȝen þei weren lad in cartes and in waynes
Tho þei hadden alle don þanne seide a gray frere
Alas sir Abbot what dide we now heere
Tho þat we comen hider it was a cold rede
Vs hadde ben better at home with water and with brede
While Gamelyn made ordres of Monkes and frere
Euer stode his brother and made foule chere
Gamelyn vp with his staff þat he wel knewe
And girt hym in þe necke þat he ouerthrewe
A litel aboue the girdel þe rigge boon tobrast  
And sette hym in þe fetres þere he sat sat arst
Sitte þer brother seyde Gamelyn
fforto colen thi body as I dide myne
As swithe as þei hadden wroken hem of her foon
Thei asked water and wasshen anoon
What some for her loue and some for her awe
Alle þe seruauntes serued hem of þe best lawe
The Sherryf was þenne but fyue myle
And alle was told hym in a lytel while
How Gamelyn and Adam hadde don a sory res
Bounden and wounden men aȝens þe kinges pes
Tho bigan soone stryf forto wake
And þe Sherryf aboute Gamelyn for to take
Now lytheth and lystneth so god ȝeue ȝou good fyne
And ȝe shullen here good game of ȝong Gamelyne
ffoure and twenty ȝongemen þat helden hem ful bolde
Come to þe Sherryf and seide þat þei wolde
Gamelyn and Adam fette by her fay
The Sherryf ȝeue hem leue soth forto say
They hyeden fast wolde þei not lynne
Tyl þei come to þe gate ther Gamelyn was Inne
They knokkiden atte gate þe porter was nygh
And lokide out at an hole as man þat was sligh

And let þe wiket stonde ful stille

We wille speke with hem two wordes or thre
ffelowe seide þe porter stonde þere stille
And I wil wende to Gamelyn to wite his wille

And seide sir I warne ȝou heere be comen ȝoure foon

And if I fayle þee þis day yuel mote I thryue
And we shullen so welcome þe Sherrifs men
That some of hem shullen make her beddes in þe fen
At a posterne gate Gamylyn out went
And a good Cartstaff in his hond hent
Adam hente soone anoþer gret staff
fforto helpen Gamelyn and good strokes ȝaf
Adam fel tweyne and Gamelyn fel three
The Other sette feet on erþe and bigan to flee
What seide adam so euere here I masse
I haue right good wyne drynk er ȝe passe


Nay bi god seide þei þi drynk is not goode
It wolde make mannes brayn to lien in his hoode
Gamelyn stode stille and lokide hym aboute
And seide þe Sherrif cometh with a gret route
Adam seide Gamelyn what ben now þi redes
Heere cometh the Sherryf and wil haue oure heedes
Adam seide to Gamelyn my rede is now þis
Abide we no lenger lest we fare Amys
I rede þat we to wode gone er þat we be founde
Better is þere louse þan in towne be bounde
Adam toke by þe hond ȝong Gamelyn
And euery of hem drank a draught of wyn
And aftir token her cours and wenten her way  
Tho fonde the Sherryf nest but noon Eye
The Sherryf light downe and wente into halle
And fonde þe lorde fetred fast withalle
The Sherryf vnfetrede hym right soone Anone
And sente aftir a lege to hele his rygge bone
Lete we now þe fals knyght lie in his care
And talke we of Gamelyn and loke howe he fare
Gamelyn into the wode stalkid stille
And adam spencer liked right ille
Adam swore to Gamelyn by seint Richere
Now I se it is mery to be a spencere
That leuer me were keyes to bere
Thanne walken in this wilde wode my clothes to tere
Adam seide Gamelyn dismay thee right noght
Many goode mannes child in care is brought
As þei stode talking bothen in fere
Adam herde talking of men and nygh hym thoght þei were
Tho Gamelyn vndir wode lokide a right
Seuene score of ȝongemen he se wel Idight
Alle Sate at þe mete compas aboute
Adam seide Gamelyn now haue I no doute
After bale cometh bote thorogh goddis myght
Me þenke of mete and drynk I haue a sight


Adam lokide tho vndir wode bough
And tho he Say mete and he was glad ynough
ffor he hoped to god to haue his dele
And he was sore alonged aftir a good mele
As he seide þat word þe mayster outlawe
Sawgh Adam and Gamelyn vndir wode shawe
Ȝongemen seide þe maister bi þe goode Rode
I am war of gestes god send vs goode
Ȝonde ben two ȝongemen wel dight
And perauenture ther ben more who so lokid a right
Arisith up ȝongemen and fette hem to me
It is good that we witen what men they be
Vp ther sterten seuene fro the dynere  
And metten with Gamelyn and adam spencere
Whan þei weren nygh hem þanne seide that one
Ȝeldeth ȝou ȝongemen ȝoure bowes and ȝoure flone
Thanne seide Gamelyn that ȝonge was of eelde
Mich sorowe mote thei haue þat to ȝou hem ȝelde
I course noon other but right my selue
Though ȝe fette to ȝou fyue þan be ȝe twelue
Tho þei herde bi his word that myght was in his arme
Ther was noon of hem þat wolde do hem harme
But seide to Gamelyn myldly and stille
Come afore our maister and seie to hym þi wille
Ȝongemen seide Gamelyn by ȝoure lewte
What man is ȝoure maister that ȝe with be
Alle þei answeride withoute lesyng
Oure mayster is corouned of outelawis king
Adam seide Gamelyn go we in cristes name
He may neiþer mete ne drynk werne vs for shame
If þat he be hende and come of gentyl bloode
He wole ȝeue us mete and drynk and do us some goode
By seint Iame seide adam what harme þat I gete
I wil auenture me that I hadde mete
Gamelyn and adam wente forth in fere
And þei grette þe mayster þat þei fonde þere


Thanne seide the mayster king of outlawis
What seke ȝe ȝongemen vndir wode shawes
Gamelyn answeride þe king with his coroun
He must nedis walke in feeld þat may not walke in toun
Sire we walke not heere noon harme to do
But if we mete a dere to shete therto
As men that ben hungry and mowe no mete fynde
And ben hard bistad vnder wode lynde
Of Gamelyn wordis the maister hadde ruthe
And seide ȝe shal haue ynow haue god my treuthe
He bad hem sitte doun forto take reste
And bad hem ete and drynke and that of the beste
As þei eten and drunken wel and fyne  
Thanne seide oon to another þis is Gamelyne
Tho was the maister outlawe into Counsel nome
And tolde how it was Gamelyn that was thider come
Anone as he herde how it was bifalle
He made hym maister vnder hym ouer hem alle
Withynne the thridde woke hym come tydyng
To the maister outlawe that was her king
That he shulde come home his pees was maad
And of that good tyding he was ful glade
Tho seide he to his ȝongemen soth forto telle
Me ben comen tydynges I may no lenger dwelle
Tho was gamelyn anone without tariyng
Made maister outlawe and corouned her king
Tho was Gamelyn crowned king of outlawes
And walkide a while vndir wode shawes
The fals knyght his brother was Shereue and sire
And lete his brother endite for hate and for hire
Tho were his bondemen sory and no þing glad
Whanne Gamelyn her lord wolfes heed was cried and maad
And sent oute of his men where þei myght hym fynde
fforto seke Gamelyn vndir wode lynde
To telle hym tidyng the wynde was went
And all his good reued and alle his men shent


Whanne þei hadden hym founden on knees þei hem setten
And adoun with her hoode and her lord gretten
Sire wrathe ȝou nought for þe goode roode
ffor we haue brought ȝou tydyng but þei be nought gode
Now is þi brother Sherreue and hath the baillie
And hath endited thee and wolfes heed doth thee crie
Allas seide Gamelyn þat euere I was so slak
That I ne hadde broke his necke tho I his rigge brak
Goth gretith wel myn husbondes and wyf
I wil be atte þe next shire and god sende me lyf
Gamelyn cam redy to þe next shire
And there was his brother boþe lord and sire
Gamelyn booldlich come into the mote halle  
And putte adoun his hoode among the lordis alle
God saue ȝou lordis that here bee
But brok bak Sherreue yuel mote thou thee
Why hast thou do me that Shame and vylonye
fforto late endite me and wolfes heed do me crie
Tho thought the fals knyght fforto ben awreke
And lete Gamelyn most he no thing speke
Might ther be no grace but Gamelyn atte þe laste
Was cast in prisoun and fetered faste
Gamelyn hath a brother that hight Sir Ote
As good a knyght and hende as myght gone on fote
Anone ȝede a messager to that good knyght
And tolde hym al togidre how gamelyn was dight
Anone as Sir Ote herde how Gamelyn was dight
He was right Sori was he no thing light
And lete sadle a stede and the way he name
And to his tweye breþerne ryght soone he came
Sir Seide Sir Ote to þe Sherreue tho
We ben but three briþerne shullen we neuere be mo
And thou hast prisoned the best of vs alle
Sich another brother yuel mote hym bifalle
Sir Ote seide the fals knyght lat be thi cours
Bi god for thy wordes he shal fare the wors


To the kinges prisoun he is nome
And there he shal abide tyl the Iustice come
Parde seide Sir Ote better it Shal be
I bydde hym to maynprise þat þou graunt me
Tyl the next sitting of delyueraunce
And late thanne Gamelyn stonde to his chaunce
Brother in siche a forward I take hym to þee
And bi þi fadris soule þat þee bigat and me
But he be redy whanne the Iustice Sitte
Thou shalt bere þe Iugement for al thi gret witte
I graunt wel seide Sir Ote that it so be
Late delyuer hym anoon and take hym to me
Tho was gamelyn delyuered to Sir Ote his brother  
And that nyght dwellide the oon with the other
On the morowen seide Gamelyn to Sir Ote þe hende
Brother he seide I mote forth fro ȝou wende
To loke how my ȝongemen leden her lyf
Whether they lyuen in ioye or ellis in stryf
By god seide sir Ote þat is a cold rede
Now I see that alle þe cark shall falle on myn hede
ffor whanne þe Iustice sitte and þou be not founde
I shal anoon be take and in thi stede bounde
Brother seide Gamelyn dismay thee nought
ffor by seynt Iame in Gales þat many man hath sought
If þat god almyghty holde me my lyf and my witte
I wille be redy whanne þe Iustice Sitte
Thanne seide Sir Ote to Gamelyn god shilde þee fro shame
Come whanne þou seest tyme and bringe vs out of blame
Litheth and listneth and holde ȝou stille
And ȝe shullen heere how Gamelyn hadde his wille
Gamelyn wente vndir wode Rys
And fonde there plaiyng ȝongemen of prys
Tho was ȝong Gamelyn right glad ynough
Whanne he fonde his men vndir wode bough
Gamelyn and his men talkiden in fere
And they hadde good game her mayster to heere


His men tolde hym of Auentures þat þei hadde founde
And Gamelyn hem told aȝen hou he was fast bounde
Whyle Gamelyn was outlawe hadde he no cors
Ther was no man that for hym farde the wors
But Abbotes and prioures Monkes and Chanoun
On hem left he nought whanne he might hem nome
Whyle Gamelyn and his men made mirthes Ryue
The fals knyght his brother yuel mote he pryue
ffor he was fast aboute boþe day and other
fforto hire the quest to hangen his brother
Gamelyn stode on a day and biheelde
The wodes and the shawes and the wylde feelde
He thought on his brother how he hym byhette  
That he wolde be redy whanne the Iustice sette
He thought wel he wolde withoute delay
Come afore the Iustice to kepen his day
And sayde to his ȝonge men dighteth ȝow ȝare
ffor whanne the Iustice sitte we must be thare
ffor I am vndir borowe tyl that I come
And my brother for me to prison shal be nome
By seynt Iame seyde his ȝongemen and þou rede þerto
Ordeyne how it shal be and it shal be do
While Gamelyn was comyng þere þe Iustice Satt
The fals knyght his brother forȝate he not þat
To hire the men on his quest to hangen his brother
Though they hadde not the oon þei wolde haue þe oþer
Tho come Gamelyn fro vndir þe wode Rys
And brought with hym ȝonge men of prys
I see wel seide Gamelyn the Iustice is sette
Go aforn Adam and loke how it spette
Adam went into þe halle and lokide al aboute
He say þere stonde lordes grete and stoute
And sir Ote hir brother fetered ful fast
Tho wente Adam oute of þe halle as he were agast
Adam seyde to Gamelyn and to his felowes alle
Sir Ote stondith fetered in the mote halle


    
    
If god ȝeue vs grace wel for to do
He shal it abigge that it brought þerto
Thanne seide Adam þat lokkes hadde hore
Cristes curs mote he haue þat hym bonde so sore
And þou wolt Gamelyn do aftir my rede
Ther is none in the halle þat shal bere awey his hede
Adam seide Gamelyn we wille not do so
We wil sle þe gyltif and late þe other go
I wil into þe halle and with the Iustice speke
On hem þat ben gyltif I wil ben awreke
Lete none scape atte þe dore take ȝongemen ȝeme
ffor I wil be Iustice þis day domes to deme
God spede me þis daye And my newe werke  
Adam come with me ffor þou schalte be my Clarke
His Men answerede hym And badde hym doone his best
And yefe þou to vs haue nede þou schalte sfynde vs prest
We woll stonde with the whyle þat we maye dure
Butte we werke Mannelye paye vs none hyere
Yonge Men sayde Gamelyn so motte I well thee
As trusty A Mayster ȝe schulle fynde of me
Righte there As the Iustyce satte in the halle
In wente Gamelyn Amonges hem all  
Gamelyn lete vnfetter his brother owte of bonde
Than sayde Sir Ote his broþere þat was hende
Thou haddeste Almoste Gamelyn dwellede to longe
The qweste is owte of Me þat I schulde honge
Brother sayde Gamelyn As god yeue me gode reste
This daye þey schullen be hangede þat bene on thy qweste
And the Iustyce bothe that is the Iugge Man
And þe Schryve boþe þroughe hym hitt biganne
Than sayde Gamelyn to the Iustyce
Now is thy power doone þou Muste nedes Aryse
Thou haste youen domes þat bene euylle dyghte
I woll sytten in þe Sete And dressen hem aryghte


The Iustyce sate stylle And rose notte anone
And Gamelyn cleuede his Cheke bone
Gamelyn toke hym in his Armes and no more spake
Butte þrewe hym ouer the barre and his Arme brake
Durste none to Gamelyn saye butte gode
ffor ffere of the Company þat withoute stode
Gamelyn sette hym downe in the Iustyce stede
    
    
Harken of bourde that Gamelyn tho dyde
He lette ffettere his brother and þe ffalse Iustyce
And lete hem come to þe barre þat oone with that other
Tho Gamelyn hadde þus ydone hadde he no reste
Tylle he hadde enquerede who was on the qweste
ffor to demen sir Ote his brother ffor to honge
Or he wyste whiche þey were itt þoughte hym to longe
Butte As soone as Gamelyn wyste where they were
He dydde hem euerychone fettren in ffere
And bryngen hem to the barre And sette hem in rewe
By my faythe sayde the Iustyce þe Schryve is A schrewe
Than sayde Gamelyn to the Iustyce
Thou haste youen domes of the worste Assyce
And the xij sysours that weren of the qweste
They schulle to daye be hangede So god yeue me gode reste
Than sayde the Schryve to yonge Gamelyn
Lorde I crye the Mercye brother Arte thou Myne
Therefor sayde Gamelyn haue thou Cristes curse
ffor And thou were Mayster yett schulde I ffare worse  
ffor to make schorte tale And notte to longe
He ordeynede hym A qweste of his men so stronge
The Iustyce and the Schryve bothe hangede hye
To wayuen with the ropes And with the wynde drye
And the xij sisours Sorrowe haue þat recke
All they were hangede ffaste by the necke
Thus endede the ffalse knyghte with his treccherye
That euer hadde ledde his lyfe in ffalsenesse and ffollye


He was hangede by the necke and noughte by the purse
That was the Mede þat he hadde ffor his ffaders curse
Sir Ote was eldeste And Gamelyn was yonge
Wenten with her ffrendes and passede with the kynge
They made pease with the kynge on the beste syse
The kynge louede Sir Ote well And made hym Iustyce
And affter the kynge made Gamelyn boþe in Este and Weste
Chyfe Iustyce of his fre fforeste
All his wyghte yonge Men þe kynge foryaue her gylte
And sythen in gode office þe kynge hadde all hem pylte
Thus wyse wanne Gamelyn his londe and his lede
And wrake hym of his ennemyes And qwytte hem her Mede
And Sir Ote his brother Made hym his heyer
And sythen weddede Gamelyn A wyfe boþe gode and ffayer
They lyueden togider whyle that Criste wolde
And sythen was Gamelyn grauen vnder Molde
And So schall we all Maye þer no Man flee
God brynge vs to the Ioye þat euer schall be
