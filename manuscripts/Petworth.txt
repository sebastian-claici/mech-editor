WHan that Aprille with his shoures soote  
The drought of marche hath perced to þe roote
And bathes euery veyne in swich licoure
Of which vertue engendrid is þe floure
Whan zephirus ek with his swete breth
Inspired hath in euery holt and heth
The tendre croppis and þe yonge sonne
Hath in the ram his halfe cours yronne
And smale foules make melodye
That slepen al nyght with open eyghe
So prikeþ hem nature in here corages
Than longen folk to gon on pilgrymages
And palmers for to seke straunge strondes
To ferne halowes couthe in sondry londes
And specially fram euery shires ende
Of engelond to Caunterbury they wende
The holy blisseful martir for to seke
That hem hath holpen when that þey were seke
Byfille þat in that seson on aday
In southwerk atte Tabbard as I lay
Redy to wende on my pilgrymage
To Cantirbury with ful devout corage
At nyht was come in to þat hostellerye
Wel nyne and twenty on a companye
Of sondry folk by auenture yfalle
In felaschipe and pilgrymes were þey alle
That toward Cantirbery wolde ryde


The Chambres and stables weren wyde
And wel weren esed atte beste
And schortly whan the sonne was to reste
So hadde I spoken with hem euerychon
That I was of here felaschipe anon
And made forward erly for to ryse
To take oure wey there as I you deuyse
But natheles whil I haue tyme and space
Or þat I ferther in this tale pace
Me thynkeþ it accordant to reson
To telle yow al the Condicion
Of ech of hem so as it semed me  
And whiche they were and of what degre
And eke in what array þat they were Inne
And at a knyght þan I wol first bigynne
Aknyght þer was and þat a worthy man
That fro þe tyme þat he ferst bigan
To riden out he louede Chyualrye
Trouthe and honour fredom and curtesye
fful worthy was he in his lordis werre
And therto hadde he ryden no man ferre
As wel in Cristendom as in hethenesse
And euere honoured for his worthynesse
 At Alisaundre he was whan it  wonne
fful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne
Aboven alle naciouns in Pruce
In lettowe had he reysed and in Ruce
No cristene man so ofte of his degre
In Gernade at the sege ek hadde he be
Of Algezire and riden in belmarye
At Lyeis was he and at Satalye
When they were wonne and in the grete see
At many a noble armeye had he be
At mortel batailles had he ben fyftene
And fouhten for oure faith at tramessene
In lystes thryes and ay slayne his foo


This ilke worthy knyght had ben also
Somtyme with the lord of Palatye
Ayeyn an othir hethen in Turkye
And euere more he hadde a souereyne pry
And though þat he was worthy he was wys
And of his port as meke as is a mayde
He neuer yet no velonye ne sayde
In al his lyf vnto no manere wight
He was a verrey parfit gentil knyght
ffor to tellen yow of his array
His hors weren gode but he was not gay
Of fustyon he werede a gepon
Al bismotered with his habirgeon
ffor he was late ycome from his viage  
And wente for to don his pilgrymage
With hym þer was his sone a yong squyere
A louyere and a lusty bachelere
With lockes crulle as they were leyd in presse
Of twenty yere of age he was I gesse
Of his stature he was of euene lengtne
And wondirly delyuere and gret of strengthe
And he hadde be somtyme in chyuachye
In fflaundres in Artoys and in Pikardye
And born him wel as of so litil space
In hope to stonde in his lady grace
Embroyded was he as it were a mede
All ful of fresshe floures white and rede
Syngynge he was or floytynge al the day
He was also fressh as ys þe moneth of may
Short was his gowne with sleves longe and wyde
Wel koude he sitte on an hors and faire ryde
He koude songes make and wel endite
Iuste and eke daunce and wel portrey and write
So hote he louede that by nygter tale
He slepte namore than doth a nyghtyngale
Corteys he was lowely and servisable


And karf biforn his fadir at the table
ANothir yeman hadde he and seruantes na mo
At that tyme for hym lyst ryde so
And he was clad in coote and hood of grene
A sheef of pocok arewes bryght and kene
Vndir his belt he bar full thriftily
Wel couthe he dresse his takel yemanly
Hise arewes drouped noght with feþeres lowe
And in his hond he bar a myghty bowe
A not hed hadde he with a broun visage
Of wode craft wel couthe he al the vsage
Vppon his arme he bar a gay bracer
And by his side a swerd and a bokeler
And on that oþir syde a gay daggere
Harneysed wel and sharp as poynt of spere
A Cristoffre on his brest of seluer shene  
An horn he bar the bawdrik was of grene
A foster was he sotly as I gesse
Ther was a nonne also a prioresse
That of hir smylynge was ful symple and coy
Hire grettest ooth was but by seyte loy
And she was clepid ma dame Englentyne
fful wel she song the seruyse divyne
Entuned in hire nose ful semyly
And frenshe she spak ful faire and fetysly
Aftir the skole of Stratford atte bowe
ffor frensch of Parys was to hire vnknowe
At mete wel Itaught was sche with alle
She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle
Ne wete hire fyngres in hire sause depe
Wel couthe she carye a morsel and wel kepe
That no drope ne fille vppon hire breste
In curtesye was set ful mochel hire leste
Hire ouer lippe wiped she so clene
That in hir cuppe ther was no ferthing sene
Of grece whan she dronken hadde hire draughte


fful semyly aftir hir mete she raughte
And sikerly sche was of gret disporte
And ful plesaunt and amable of porte
And peynede hire to counterfete chere
Of court and to ben estatliche of manere
And to be holden digne of reuerence
But for to speken of hir Conciense
She was so charitable and so pitous
She wolde wepe yif that she sauh a mous
Kaugh in a trappe yif it were ded or bledde
Of smale houndes had she that she fedde
With rostid flessh or mylk or wastelbrede
But sore wepte she yf oon of hem were dede
Or yf men smoot yt with a yerde smerte
And al was conscience and tendre herte
fful semeliche hire wympil pynchid was
Hir nose was streight hire eighen grey as glas
Hire mouth ful smal and therto softe and rede  
But sekerly she hadde a fair forhede
It was almost a spanne brood I trowe
ffor hardely she was nouht vndirgrowe
fful fetys was hir cloke as I was waar
Of smal coral aboute hir arme she baar
A paire of bedys gaudid al with grene
And ther on hyng a broche of gold ful shene
On which þer was first writen a crowned A
And aftir amor vincit omnia
An othir Nonne with hire hadde she
That was hire chapeleyn and prestes thre
Amonk þer was a fair for the maistrye
An out ridere that loued venerye
A manly man to ben an Abbot able
fful many a deynte hors hadde he in stable
And whanne he rood  men myhte his brydill here
Gynglynge in a whistelynge wynd as clere
And eke as loude as dooth þe chapel belle


Ther as this lord was keper of the selle
The reule of seynt Maure or of seint Benet
Bi cause þat yt was olde and somdel streit
This ylke monke leet olde þynges pace
And heeld aftir the newe world the space
He yaf nouht of the text a pulled hen
That seith that hunters be nouht holy men
Ne that a monke whan he is recheles
Is likened tille a fisshe þat is watirles
This is to seye a monke out of his cloistre
But thilke text held he nouht worth an oystre
And I seyde his opynion was good
What shulde he studie and make hymself wood
Vpon a book alwey in cloistre to poure
Or swynke with his hondis and laboure
As Austyn bit hou shal the world be serued
Lat Austyn haue his swynk to him reserued
Therfore he was a pricasour aright
Grehoundes he hadde  as swift as foule in flight
Of prikynge and of huntynge for the hare  
Was al his lust for no cost wole he spare
I seigh hise sleves Ipurfiled at the hond
With grys and that the fynest of a lond
And for to festne his hood vndir the Chynne
He hadde of gold wrought a ful curious pynne
A loue knotte in the gretter ende þer was
His hed was ballyd that shon as ony glas
And eke his face as he hadde ben anoynt
He was a lord ful fat and in good poynt
Hise eighen stepe and rollynge in his hede
That stemede as a fourneys of a lede
Hise botes souple his hors in grete estate
Now certeynly he was a fair prelate
He nas nat pale as a forpyned goost
A fat swan louede he best of any roost
His palfray was  broun as ys a berye


A ffrere ther was a watoune and  merye
A lymytour a ful solempne man
In alle the ordres foure is noon that can
So mochel of daliance and fair langage
He hadde made ful many a Mariage
Of yonge wommen at his owne cost
Vn to his ordre he was a noble post
fful wel biloued and famulier was he
With frankeleynes oueral in his contre
And with worthy wommen of the toun
ffor he hadde power of confessioun
As seide hym self more than a Curat
ffor  his ordre he was lycenciat
fful swetely herede he confession
And plesaunt was his absolucion
He was an esy man to yeue penance
Ther as he wiste to han a good pitance
ffor wnto a pore ordre for to yeue
Is signe that a man ys wel yshreve
ffor yf he yaf he dorste make avaunt
He wiste þat a man was repentaunt
ffor many a man is so hard of his herte  
He may noght wepe al þouh him sore smerte
Ther fore in stede of wepynge and preieres
Men mote yeue seluer  to the pore freres
His tipet was ay fassed ful of knyfes
And pynnes for to yeue faire wyfes
And certeynly he hadde a mery note
Wel coude he syngen and playen on a roote
Of yeddynges he bar vttirly the pryce
His necke white was as the flour delyce
Therto he was strong as a champioun
He knew the tauernes wel in every toun
And eueriche Osteller and tapestere
Bet than a lazer or a beggere
ffor vnto swich a worthy man as he


Acordith nouht as by his faculte
To haue with swich seke lazers aqueyntance
It is nouht honest  it may nouht avance
ffor to delen with swich poraille
But al with riche and sillers of vitaille
And oueral ther as profite sholde aryse
Curtays he was and lowely of seruyse
Ther nas no man nowher so vertuous
He was the beste beggere in his hous
     
ffor þouh a widewe hadde nouht a sho
So plesaunt was his Inprincipio
Yet wolde he haue a ferthyng or he wente
His purchace was wel bettere þan his rente
And rage he couthe as it were riht a whelpe
In louedaies ther coude he mochil helpe
ffor ther he was not liche a cloistrere
With a thredbare cope as a pore scolere
But he was lyke a maistir or a pope
Of double worstede was his semy cope
That rounded as a belle out of the presse
Somwhat he lipsede for his wantonesse
To make his englyssh swete vppon his tonge
And in his harpynge whan þat he had songe
Hise eyghen twynclede in his hede aright  
As doon the sterres in a frosty nyht
This worthy lymytour was clepid hubert
A Marchant was ther with a longe berd
In motle and heyh on horse he satte
Vppon his heued a flaundrisshe beuer hatte
Hise botis clapsid faire and fetisly
His resouns he spak ful solempnely
Shewynge alwey the encres of his wynnynge
He wolde the see were kept for any thynge
Bitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle


Wel coude he in eschange sheldes selle
This worthy man ful wel his witte bisette
Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette
So estatly was he of his gouernance
With his bargaynes and with his cheuyssance
fforsothe he was a worthy man with alle
But sothely to seyne I not how men hym calle
A Clerk þer was of Oxenforde also
That vnto logyk hadde longe Igo
As lene was his hors as ys a rake
And he was not right fat I wndirtake
But lokede holewh and þerto soburly
fful thredbare was his ouerest Courtepy
ffor he hadde yit geten him no benefice
Ne was so wordly  to haue office
ffor hym was leuere haue at his bed hede
Twenty bokes clad in blak or rede
Of Aristotle and his philosophie
Then robes riche or fithel or gay sautrye
But al be that he was a philosofre
Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre
But al that he myhte of his frendes hente
On bokes and on lernynge he it spente
And besily gan for tho soules preye
Of hem that yaf hym wharwith to skoleaye
Of studie took he moost cure and most hede
Naught a word spak he  more than was nede 
And that was seid in forme and reuerence  
And short and quyk and ful  hey sentence
Sownynge in moral vertue was his speche
And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche
A sergant of the lawe  war and wys
That often hadde ben atte parvys
That was also ful riche of excellence
Discret he was and of gret reuerence
He semed swich hise wordis wern so wise


Iustice he was ful often in assise
By patent and by pleyn commyssioun
ffor his science and for his high renoun
Of fees and robes hadde he many on
So gret a purchassour was nowher non
Al was fee symple to him in effecte
His purchassynge myht nouht ben infecte
Nowher so besy a man as he ther nas
And yet he semed bisiere than he was
In termes hadde he caas and domes alle
That from the tyme of kyng william were falle
Therto he cowde endite and make a thyng
Ther couthe no wight pynche at his writyng
And euery statute couthe he pleyne by roote
He rood but homely in a medle coote
Gert with a sent of selk wiþ barres smale
Of his array telle I no lenger tale
Affrankeleyn was in his compaignye
Whit was his berd as is the daieseye
Of his complexioun he was sangwyne
Wel louede he by the morewe a soppe in wyne
To lyuen in delite euere was his wone
ffor he was Epiournes owne sone
That helde opynyon þat pleyn delite
Was verrey felicite parfite
An houshaldere and that a greet was he
Seint Iulyan he was in his contre
His bred his ale was alleweys aftir oon
A bettir envyned man  was nowher noon 
With oute bakemete was neuere his hous  
Of fissche and fleisshe and þat so plentevous
It snewede in his hous of mete and drynke
Of alle deyntethes that men couthe thinke
Aftir the sondry sesons of the yere
So changed he his mete and his sopere
fful many a fat partrich hadde he in Mewe


And many a breme and many a luce in stewe
Wo was his cook but  his sauce were
Poynant and sharpe and redy al his gere
His table dormant in his halle al way
Stood redy couered al the longe day
At sessions ther was he lord and sire
fful often tyme he was knyght of the shire
An anelas and a gypsere al of silke
Heng at his girdel white as morne mylke
A sherreff had he ben  and a comptour
Was nowher swich a worthy vauasour
AN habirdasshere and a Carpenter
A Webbe a Diere and a Tapecere
And they were clothid alle in oo lyuere
Of a solempne and a greet fraternyte
fful fressh and newe here gere apiked was
Here knyfes nere chap nouht with bras
But al with syluer wrought ful clene and wel
Here gerdelles and her pouches euery del
Wel semed ech of hem a fair burgeys
To sitten in a yeldhalle on a deys
Eueriche for the wisdom that he can
Was shaply for to bene an Aldirman
For catell hadde they Inouh and Rente
And eke her wifes wolde it wel assente
And elles certeyn they were to blame
It is ful fair to be clepid Madame
And gon to vigilies al be fore
And haue a mantel rialliche Ibore
A Cook they hadde  with hem for the nones
To boille the chikenes with þe maribones
And poudre Marchant tart of Gallyngale  
Wel kowde he knowe a drauht of london ale
He Couthe roste and sethe and broyle and ffrye
Maken Mortrews and wel bake a pye
But gret ham was it  as it thouhte me


That on his shene a mormal hadde he
For blank manger that made he with the beste
A Shipman was ther  wonyng fer bi weste
For ouht I woot he was of Dertemouthe
He rood vppon a Rouncy as he couthe
In a gowne of ffaldyng to the kne
A daggar hangynge in a lace hadde he
Aboute his necke vndir his arme doun
The hote somer hadde made his hiew al broun
And Certeynly he was a good felawe
fful many a drauht of wyn hadde he drawe
ffrom burdeux ward while the chapmen slepe
Of nyce conscience took he no kepe
Yif that he fauht  and hadde the heihere hond
By watir he sente hem home to euery lond
But of his craft  to rikene wel his tydes
His stremes and his daunger him bisydes
His herberuh his moone and his lodmanage
Ther nos noon such from hulle to Cartage
Hardy he was  and wys to vndirtake
With many a tempest had his berd be shake
He knew alle the hauenes as they were
ffro gutlond to the cape de fynystere
And euery cryke in bretaygne and in Spayne
His barge yclepid was the maudeleyne
With us ther was a doctour of ffisik
In al this world ne was ther none hym lik
To speke of fisike and of surgerye
ffor he was grounded in astronomye
He kepte his pacient a ful greet del
In houres by his magik naturel
Wel couthe he fortune the assendent
Of his ymages for his pacient
He knew the cause of euery maladye  
Were it of hoot or cold or moyst or drye
And wher engendred and  what humour


He was a verrey parfit practisour
The cause Iknowe and of his harm the roote
Anoon he yaf the sike man his boote
fful redy hadde he hise apotecaries
To sende hem drugges  and his letuaries
ffor ech of hem made othir for to wynne
Her frendshipe nas nat newe to bigynne
Wel knew he the olde Escalapius
And diascoride and ek Rufus
Old ypocras Hayly and Galien
Serapion Rasis and Auysen
Aueroys Damascien and constantyne
Bernard and Gatisden and Gilbertyne
Of his diete mesurable was he
ffor it was of no superfluyte
Bot of gret norshinge and digestable
His studie was but litel on the bible
In sangweyn and in perce he clad was al
Lyned with Taffata and with sendal
And yet he was but esy of dispense
He kepte that he wan in pestilence
ffor gold in Phisik is a cordeal
Therfore he louede gold in special
A Good wiff ther was of besides bathe
But she was somdel def and þat was scathe
Of cloth makynge sche hadde such an haunt
She passid hem of ypres and of Gaunt
In alle the parisch wif ne was ther noon
That to the offrynge toforn hir shulde goon
And yf ther dide  certeyn wroth was she
That she was out of al charite
Hir couerchefes ful fyne were of ground
I durste swere they weyeden ten pound
That on a Sonday weren vpon hire hede
Hir hosen weren of fyne scarlet rede
fful streight Iteied  and shoes ful moist and newe  

Bold was hir face and faire  and red of hiewe
She was a worthi womman al hir lyue
Housbondes atte chirche dore she hadde fyue
With outen othir companie in youthe
But ther of nedith nouht to speke as nouthe
And thries hadde she bene at Ierusalem
She had passed many a strange strem
At Rome sche had ben  and at boloyne
In Galice at saint Iame and at Coloigne
She koude moche on wandrynge bi the weye
Gat tothid was she sothely for to seie
Vp on an Amblere esily she satte
Iwympled wel and on hir heed an hatte
As brood as is a bokellere or a targe
A fot mantel abouten hire hipes large
And on hire feet a paire of spores sharpe
In felaschipe wel couthe sche lawhe and carpe
Of remedies of loue she kneuh parchaunce
ffor she couthe of that art the daunce
A Good man was there of religioun
And was a pore persoun of a toun
But riche he was of holy thouht and werk
He was also a lerned man and a clerk
That Cristes gospel treuly wolde preche
His parisschens deuoutly wolde he teche
Benyngne he was and wondir diligent
And in aduersite  ful pacient
And swich he was preued ofte sithes
fful looth were him to cursen for his tythes
But rather wolde he yeuen out of doute
Vnto his poure parisshens aboute
Of his offrynge and of his substance
He couthe in litil thing han suffisance
Wide was hise parisshe and houses fer asondir
But he ne lafte nouthir for rayne ne for thundir
In sikenesse nor in meschief to visite


The ferrest in his parisch myche and lite
Vp on his fete  and in his hond a staff  
This noble ensample to his shepe he yaf
That ferst he wroughte and aftirward þat he tauhte
Out of the gospel he þo wordes cauhte
And this figure he addede ek therto
That yf gold ruste  what shal Iren do
For if a prest be foul on whom we triste
No wondir is a lewed man to ruste
And shame it is yf a prest take kepe
A shiten sheperde and a clene shepe
Wel ouhte a preest ensample for to yeue
By his clennesse hou that his sheepe shulde lyue
He set nauht his benefice to hire
And leet his sheep acombred in the myre
And ran to london vn to seint Poules
To seke hym a chanterye for soules
Or with a bretherhede to bene with holde
But duelte at home  and kepte wel his folde
So that the wolf ne made it not myscarye
He was a shepperde and not a mercenarie
And thouh he holy were and vertuous
He was nouht to synful men dispitous
Ne on his speche daungerous ne digne
But in his techynge discret and benygne
To drawen folk to heuene by fairnesse
By good ensample  this was his bisynesse
But it were eny person obstynate
What so he were of heigh or lowh estate
Hym wolde he snebbe sharply for the nones
A bettre prest I trowe þat nowher noon es
He waitede aftir no pompe and reuerence
Ne maked hym a spiced conscience
But cristes lore  and hise apostles tuelue
He tauhte  but ferst he folewed in hymselue
With hym ther was a plouhman  was his broþir


That hadde Ilad of dong ful many a fothir
And a trewe swynkere and a good was he
Lyvynge in pees  and parfit charite
God loued he best with al his hole herte  
At alle tymes thouh he gamed or smerte
And than his neighbure riht as hymselue
He wolde thresshe and therto dike and delue
For cristes sake  for euery pouere wight
With oute hire  yif hit lay in his myght
Hise tythis payed he ful faire and wel
Bothen of his propre swynke and his catel
In a tabbard he rood vp on a mere
Ther was also a Reve and a Mellere
A somenour and a Pardoner also
A Maunciple and my self ther nar na mo
The mellere was a strong carle for the nones
fful bigge he was  of brawne and ek of bones
That proued wel  for oueral thare he cam
Atte wrastelynge  he wolde haue awey the ram
He was short shuldred a thicke knarre
Ther was no dore that he ne wolde heue of barre
Or breke it at a rennynge with his heed
His berd as any sowe or fox was reed
And therto brood as þouh it were a spade
Vp on the cop right of his nose he hade
A werte and þeron stood a tuft of heres
Rede as the brysteles of a sowes eres
His nose þrilles blake were and wyde
A swerd and a bokelere bar he be his side
His mouthe as greet was as a greet fourneys
He was a iangelere and a goliardeys
And that was moost of synne and of harlotryes
Wel couthe he stele corn  and tolle thryes
And yit he hadde a thombe of gold parde
A white cote and a blewe hood wered he
A baggepipe wel couthe he blowe and sowne


And þerwith al he brouht us out of towne
A Gentil manciple was þer o a temple
Of which a catour myghte take ensample
ffor to ben wise in biynge of vitaille
ffor wheþir þat he payed  or toke by taille
Algate he waitede so in his achate  
That he was ay beforn and in good estate
Now is not þat of god a ful fair grace
That such a lewed mannes wit shal pace
The wysdom of an hepe of lerned men
Of maystres hadde he mo þan thries ten
That were of lawe expert an Curious
Of wich ther was a doseyn in that hous
Worthy to bene stywardes of Rente and lond
Of any lord that is in Ingelond
To make hym lyue by his propre good
In honour detteles but if that he were wood
Or lyue als skarsly as hym lyst desire
And able for to helpen al a shire
In any cas that myhte falle or happe
And yit this Maunciple sette ther althir cappe
The Reue was a sclendre colerik man
His berd was shaue  as nyhe as euer he can
His heer was by hise eres ful rounde yshorne
His toppe was docked like a prest byforne
fful longe were his legges and ful lene
Ilike a staf  ther was no calf ysene
Wel couthe he kepe a Garner or a bynne
Ther was none auditour couthe on hym wynne
Wel wiste he  by the drought and by the reyne
The yeldynge of his seed  and of his greyne
Hise lordes sheepe  hise neete  hise dayerie
His swyne  his hors  his stoor  and his pultrye
Was hoolly in this reues gouernynge
And by his covenant  yaf the rekenynge
Syn that his lord was twenty yeer of age


Ther couthe no man brynge hym in arerage
Ther nas baylyf ne herde nor othir hyne
That he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne
They were adrad of hym  as of the deth
His wonynge was ful faire vpon an heth
With grene trees  shadewed was his place
He couthe bettre than his lord purchace
fful riche he was astored pryuely  
His lorde he couþe wel plese and subily
To ȝeue and lene him of his owne goode
To haue a þonke and yit a cote and hode
In ȝouþe he had lered a good mistere
He was a wel good wriȝt a Carpentere
This Reue satte vpon a wel good stot
That was al pomel grey and highte scot
A longe Surcote of Peers vppon he hadde
And by his side he bare a rusty blade
Of Northfolk was þis Reue of which I telle
Besides a toune men clepen it Baldewelle
Tukked he was as is a frere aboute
And euere he rode þe hynderest of our route
A Somnour was ther wiþ vs in that place
That had a fury cherubynes face
ffor Sauseflewme he was wiþ eyen narowe
Als hote he was and leccherous as a sparowe
With scalled browes blak and pilled beerde
Of his visage children weren aferde
Ther nas quyk siluer litarge or bremston
Boras orsure no oyle of tartre nōōn
Ne oynement þat wold clense and byte
That him myght helpe of his whelkes white
Ne of  knobbes sitting in his chekes
Wel loued he garlike oynyons and eke lekes
And for to drink strong wyne rede as blode
Than wolde he speke and cry as he were wode
And whan  he wel dronken had þe wyne


Than wolde he speke no worde but latyne
A fewe teermes had he two or thre
That he had lerned out of som decree
No wonder is he herd to al þe day
And eke ȝe knowen it wel how þat a Iay
Can clepe watt as wel as can þe pope
But who so couþe in oþer þing hym grope
Than had he spent al his Philosophie  
Ay questio quid iuris wold he crye
He was a gentile harlot and a kinde
A better felawe shul men not fynde
He wolde suffre for a quarte of wyne
A good felawe to haue his concubyne
A twelue month and excuse him ate fulle
fful priuely eke a ffynche couþe he pulle
And if he fonde owhere a good felawe
He wolde techen hym to han noon awe
In such caas of þe archedekens curs
But if  mannys soule were in his purs
ffor in his purs he shuld punshed be
Purs is þe erchedekenes Helle seide he
But wel I wote he lyed riȝt in dede
Of cursing ouȝt eche gilty man to drede
ffor curs wil slee riȝt as assoyling saueth
And also war hym of a significauith
In daunger had he at his owne gyse
The yonge Geerles of þe diocise
And knewe her counsaile and what was al her rede
A Gallonde had he sette vpon his hede
As grete as it were for an ale stake
A Bokelere had he made hym of a Cake
With hym þer rode a gentile Pardoner
Of rouncyuale his frende and his comper
That streght was commen from þe courte of Rome
fful lowde songe he come hider loue come
This somnour bare to hym a stif burdon


Was neuere trumpe of half so gret a soun
This Pardoner had heer as ȝelowe as wexe
But smoth it henge as doþ a strike of flexe
By ounces henge his lockes þat he had
And þerwiþ he his shulders ouersprad
But thyn it lay by culpons oon and on
But hode for Iolite wered he noon
ffor it was trussed vp in his walette  
Hym þouȝt he rode al of þe newe gette
Discheuele sauf his cap he rode al bare
Suche glaryng eyen had he as an hare
A vernycle had he sewed vpon his cappe
His walet  biforn him in his lappe
Bret ful of pardon commen from Rome al hote
A voyce he had as smal as a goote
No beerde ne had he ne neuere shuld haue
As smoth it was as it were late shaue
I trowe he were a gelding or a mare
But of his craft from Barwik into ware
Ne was þer suche a noþer pardonere
ffor in his male he had a pilowbere
Which þat he seide was oure lady vaile
He seide he had a gobet of þe saile
That seynt Peter had whan þat he went
Vpon þe see to Ihesu crist hym hent
He had a croys of laton ful of stones
And in a glas he had pigges bones
But wiþ þise relikes whan þat he fonde
A poor person dwellyng vpon londe
Vpon a day he gate hym more moneye
Þan þe the persone gate in Monþes tweye
And þus wiþ feyned flateryng and Iapes
He made þe Person and þe puple his apes
But trewly to tellen at þe laste
He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste
Wel couþe he rede a lesson or a storye


But alþerbest he song an offertorie
ffor wel he wist whan þat songe was songe
He moste preche and wel afile his tonge
To wynne siluer as he  wel cowde
Therfore he songe so merily and lowde
Now have I tolld ȝou soþly in a clause
The astaat þe aray þe nombre and eke þe cause
Why þat assembled was þis companye  
In Suthwerk at þis gentil hostrye
That hight þe Tabard faste by þe belle
But nowe is tyme to ȝou forto telle
Howe þat we beren vs þat ilke nyght
Whan  were in þat Hostrie alight
And after wil I tellen of our viage
And al þe remenaunt of our Pilgrymage
But furst I prey ȝou of ȝoure curtesie
That ȝe ne rette it not my vilanye
þoo þat I pleynly speke in þis matere
To telle ȝou her wordes and her chere
Ne þouȝe he speke her wordes proprely
ffor þis ȝe knowen as wel as I
Who so shal telle a tale after a man
He mote reherce as nyghe as euer he can
Eueriche word if it be in his charge
Al speke he neuere so rudely and large
Or ellis he mote telle his tale vntrewe
Or feyne þinggis or fynde wordes newe
He may not spare al þough he were his broþer
He mot also wel say oo word as another
Crist spak him self ful brode in holy writte
And wel ȝe wote no vilanye is itte
Eke Plato seiþ who so can hym rede
The wordes mote be cosyn to þe dede
Also I prey ȝou  forȝeue it me
Al haue I not sette folk in her degre
Here in þis tale as þat thei shulde stonde


My witte is short ȝe may wel vnderstonde
Grete chere made oure hooste vs euerechon
And to þe soper sette he vs anon
He serued vs with vitailles at þe best
Stronge was þe wyne and wel  drink vs lest
A semely man our hooste was wiþ all
ffor to  bene a marshal in an hall
A large man he was with yen stepe  
A fairer Burges is  none in chepe
Bold of his speche and wise and wel ytauȝt
And of manhode hym lacked right naught
Eke þerto he was right a mery man
And after sopere pleyen he bygan
And spak of myrth amonge oþer þinges
Whan that we had made our rekenyngges
And seide þus now lordingges trewly
Ȝe bene to me welcome riȝt hertely
ffor be my trouþe if þat I shal not lye
I seegh not þis ȝere so mery a companye
At ones in þis harborowe as is nowe
ffayne wold I do ȝou merthe wist I howe
And of a merþe I am right now byþought
To don ȝou ease and it shal coste nouȝt
Ȝe gone to canterbery god ȝou spede
þe blisful martir quite ȝou ȝour mede
And wel I wote as ȝe goon by þe way
Ȝe shapen ȝou to talen and to pley
ffor trewly conforte ne myrthe is nōn
To riden by þe wey dombe as a stone
And þerfor wil I make ȝou disporte
As I seide erste and don ȝou som conforte
And if ȝou likeþ alle by oon assente
 fforto stonden at my Iuggemente
And forto worchen as I shal ȝou seie
To morowe whan ȝe riden by þe weie
Now be my faders soule þat is dede


But ȝe be mery I wil ȝeue ȝou my hede
Holde vp ȝoure hondes wiþ out more speche
Our counsaile was not longe for to seche
Vs þouȝt it was not  worþe to make to wis
And graunted hym wiþ oute more avis
And bad him seie his veredit as him lest
Lordingges quod he nowe herkeneþ for þe best
But take it not I prei ȝou in disdeyne  
This is þe point to speke short and pleyne
That eche of ȝou to shorte wiþ our waye
In þis viage shal telle tailles twaye
To Caunterbery ward I mene it so
And homwardes he shal telle oþere twoo
Of auentures þat han whilom bifalle
And which of ȝou þat bereþ hym best of alle
þat is to sey þat telleþ in þis cas
Tales of best sentence and most solas
shal haue a sopere at our alder cost
Her in þis place sitting by þis post
Whan þat we commen ageyn from Canterburye
And forto make ȝou þe more merye
I wil my seluen goodly wiþ ȝou ride
Right at myne owne cost and be ȝour gide
And who so wil my Iugement wiþseye
Shal pay al þat we spenden by þe weye
And if ȝe vouche sauf þat it be so
Telle me anoon wiþ outen wordes moo
And I will erly shape me þerfore
þis þinge was graunted and our oþes swore
Wiþ ful glad hert and preien hym also
þat he wolde vouchesauf so to do
And þat he wolde be our gouernour
And of our tales Iugge and roportour
And sette a sopere at a certeyn price
And we wold rewled bene at his deuice
In heghe and lough and þus by on assent


We bene accorded to þe Iuggement
And þer vpon þe wyne was fette anon
We dronken and to reste wente echon
Wiþ oute eny lenger tariynge
On morowe whan þe day gan to sprynge
Vp roos oure hooste and was oure alder Cok
And gadered vs to gidere in a flok
And forþ we riden a litel more þan paas  
Vnto þe watering of Seynt Thomas
And þer our hooste gan his hors areste
And seide lordes harkeneþ if yow leste
Ȝe wote ȝoure forward and I it ȝou record
If euensonge and morowsonge accord
Lat see nowe who shal telle þe first tale
As euer mote I drinke wyne or ale
Who so be rebell to my Iuggement
Shal paye for al þat by þe way is spent
Now draweþ Cut er þat we ferþer twynne
Which þat haþ þe shortest shal bygynne
 Sir knyght quod he my maister and my lorde
Now droweþ Cutte for þat is myn accorde
Commeth nere quod he my lady prioresse
And ȝe sir Clerk lat be ȝoure shamfastnesse
Ne stodieth nouȝt lay honde to euery man
Anon to drawe every wight bygan
And shortely forto tellen as it was
Were it be auenture or sort or cas
The soþe is þis þe Cut fille to þe knyȝt
Of which full glad and bliþe was euery wiȝt
And tellen he most his tale as it was reson
By forward and by compocion
As ȝe han herde what needet wordes moo
And whan þis good man seegh þat it was soo
As he þat wise was and obedient
To kepen his forward by his fre assent
He seide siþen I shal bygynne þe game


What welcome be þe Cutte a goddis name
Now lat vs ride and harkeneþ what I saye
And wiþ þat word we riden forþ our waye
And  byganne wiþ riȝt a mery chere
His tale anon and seide as ȝe may here
Whilom was  as olde stories tellen vs  
A worþi duk hight theseus
Of Athenes he was lord and gouernour
And in his tyme suche a Conquerour
That gretter was  noon vnder þe sunne
fful many a riche contre had he wonne
What wiþ his wisdom and his chyualrye
He conquered al þe regne of femynye
That whilom was ycleped Sithia
And wedded þe quene ypolita
And brouȝt her home wiþ hym to his cuntre
Whith moch glorie and gret solempnite
And eke her ȝenge suster Emelie
And þus with victorie and with melodye
Lat I þis noble Duke to Athenes ride
And al his hooste in armes hym beside
And certes if it nere to longe to here
I wold haue tolde fully þe manere
Howe wonnen was þe Reaume of ffemyny
By Theseus and by his Chiualrye
And of þe grete bataille for þe nones
Bytwyxen Athenes and amazones
And howe asseged was ypolita
The faire ladye qune of Scithia
And of þe feest þat was at her weddinge
And of þe tempest at her home commynge
But al þat þing I mot as nowe forbere
I haue god wote a large feelde to ere
And weike bene þe oxen in my plough
The remenaunte of þe tale is long ynogh
I wil not letten eke noon of þis route


Lat euery felawe telle his tale aboute
And lat se nowe who shal þe soper wynne
And þer I lafte I wil aȝein bygynne
This Duk of whom I make mencioun  
Whan he was commen almost to þe toun
In al his wele and his most Pride
He was war as he cast his eyen atside
Where þat þer kneled in þe highe waye
A companye of ladys twey and tweye
Eche after oþer clad in cloþes blake
But suche a crye and such a woo þei make
That in þis worlde is creature lyuynge
That herde suche anoþer wamentinge
And of þis crie þei nolde neuere stynte
Til þei þe Reynes of his bridel hente
What folk bene ȝe þat at myn home commynge
Pertourben so my feest wiþ criynge
Quod Theseus haue ȝe so grete envie
Of myn honour þat þus compleyn and crye
Or who haþ ȝou mysdone or offended
Telleþ me if it may be amendet
And whi þat ȝe bene cloped þus in blak
The eldest lady of hem al spak
Whan she had swowned wiþ a dedly chere
þat it was rauthe forto sene and here
She seide lord to whom fortune haþ ȝeuen
Victorie and as a conquerour to lyuen
Nat greueþ vs ȝoure glory and ȝour honour
But we biseke mercy and socour
Haue mercy on our woo and our distresse
Some drope of Pite þorgh þi gentelnesse
Vpon vs wrecched wommen lat nowe falle
ffor certes lord þer is noon of vs alle
That she ne haþ bene a doches or a quene
Nowe bene we Catyues as it is wel sene
Thonked be fortune and her fals qwhele


þat noon estate ensureþ forto bene wele
Now certes lord to abide ȝour presence
Here in þis temple of þe goddes clemence
We han be wayting al þis fourtnyȝt  
Helpe vs lord siþ it is in þi myght
I wrecche which þat wepe and weile þus
Whilom was wif to king Cappaneus
That starfe at Thebes cursed be þat day
And alle we þat bene in þis araye
And maken al þis lamentacioun
We losten alle our husbondes at þat toun
While þat þe assege þer aboute lay
And ȝit nowe þe olde Creon weillaway
That lord is nowe of Thebes Cite
ffulfilled of yre and of iniquite
He for despite and for his tyrannye
To doon þe dede bodys vilenye
Of al our lordes which þat bene sclawe
Haþ al þe bodies on an hepe ydrawe
And wol not suffre hem by non assent
Neiþere to bene yburied neiþer brent
But makeþ houndes ete hem in despit
And wiþ þat word withouten more respit
þei fillen a Gruf and criden pitously
Haue on vs wrecched women som mercy
And lat oure sorowe synken in þi hert
 This gentel duke doune from his courser stert
Wiþ herte pitous whan he herde hem speke
Him þouȝte þat his hert wold altobreke
Whan he seegh hem so pitous and so mate
þat whilom were of so grete astate
And in his armes he hem alle vp hente
And hem conforteþ in ful good entente
And swore his oþe as he was trewe knyȝt
He wolde done so ferforþly his myȝt
Vppon the Tirant Creon hem to wreke


þat alle þe puple of Grece shuld speke
How Creon was of Theseus yserued
As he þat had his deþ ful wel deserued
And right anon withouten more abode  
His baner he displeied and forþ rode
To Thebes ward and al his hooste beside
No ner Athenes wold he goo ne ride
Ne take his case fulli half a day
But onward on his way þat nyȝt he lay
And sent anoon ypolita the quene
And Emelye hir yonge sustre Shene
Vnto þe toune of Athenes to dwelle
And forþe he ritte þer is no more to telle
The rede statue of Mars wiþ spere and targe
So shyneþ in his white baner large
þat alle the feeldes glyteren vp and doun
And by his baner born is hys pynyoun
Of gold ful riche in which þer was ybete
þe Mynataur which þat he wan in Crete
Thus riȝt þis duk thus riȝt þis conquerour
And in his ooste of Chyualrye þe flour
Til þat he come to Thebes and alight
ffaire in a felde þer as he þouȝt to fiȝt
But shortely forto speken of þis þing
With Creon whiche þat was of Thebes king
He faught and sclowgh him manly as a knyght
In pleyn bataille and put þe folk to flight
And by asseut he wan the Cite after
And rent adoun boþ walle spare and rafter
And to þe ladies he restored ageyn
þe bones of her frendes þat were scleyn
To done obsequies as was þe gyse
But it were al to longe forto devise
The grete clamour and þe wamentynge
þat þe ladies made at þe brennynge
Of þe bodies and þe grete honour


That theseus þe noble conquerour
Doþ to þe bodies whan þei ffrom hym went
But shortely to telle is myn entent
Whan þat þis worþi Duke þis theseus  
Haþ Creon sclayn and wonne Thebes þus
Stille in þat felde he toke al nyȝt his rest
And did wiþ al þe contre as hym lest
To Ransake in þe caas of þe bodies dede
Hem for to stripe of harneyes and of wede
The pilours dyden bysynesse and Cure
Aftere þe bataille and þe discomfiture
And so bifelle þat in þe caas þei founde
þorgh girt wiþ many a greuous blody wounde
Two yonge knyghtes ligging by and by
Bothen in armes same wrouȝt ful richelie
Of whiche two Arcita hight that oon
And þat oþere knyȝt hight Palamon
Not fully quyk ne fully dede þei were
But by her cote armours and by her gere
The herowdes knewe hem self in special
As þei þat were of þe blood Riall
Of Thebes and of sustren two yborn
Out of þe caas þe Pilours han hem torn
And han hem caried soft vnto þe tent
Of Theseus and he ful sone hem sent
To Athenes to dwellen in Prison
Perpetuelly hem nolde he not raunson
And whan this worþi Duke haþ þus ydon
He toke his ooste and home he ritte anon
Wiþ laurere corowned as a conquerour
And þer he lyueþ in Ioie and in honour
Teerme of his lif what nedeþ wordes moo
And in a toure in anguissh and in woo
Dwellen þis Palamon and eke arcite
ffor euermore þer may no gold hem quyte
This passeþ yere by yere and day by day


Till it fille onys in a morowe of May
That Emely þat fairer was to sene
Than is þe lyle vpon his stalke grene
And fressher þan þe may wiþ floures newe  
ffor wiþ þe roos colour strof hir hwe
I not which was þe fairer of hem twoo
Er it were day as was her wone to doo
She was arisen and al a redy dight
ffor May wil haue no scloggardy on nyȝt
The seson pricketh euery gentile hert
And makeþ hit out of his slepe to stert
And sithen arise and doo May obseruaunce
This makeþ Emely to haue remembraunce
To don honour to May and forto rise
Ycloþed was she fressh forto devise
 Her ȝelowe heer was breided in a tresse
Behynde her bak a ȝeerde longe y gesse
And in þe gardyne at sonne vprist
She walkeþ vp and doun and as her list
She gadereþ floures partie white and rede
To make a subtile garlonde for her hede
And as an aungel heuenly she songe
The grete toure þat was so þikke and stronge
Which of þe castel was þe chief dongeon
There as þe knyghtes weren in prison
Of which I tolke ȝowe and telle shall
Was euene Ioynant to þe gardyn wall
Ther as þis Emely had her pleying
Briȝt was þe sonne and cleer in þat mornyng
And palamon þis woful prisonere
As was his wonne by lieue of his Gaillere
Was rysen and romed in a chamber on high
In which he al þe noble Cite segh
And eke þe gardyne ful of braunches grene
Ther as þe fressh emelye þe shene
Was in her walk and romed vp and doun


This soriful prisoner þis Palamoun
Goþ in þe Chambre romyng to and froo
And to him self compleynyng of his woo
That he was born ful ofte seide allas  
And so byfelle by auenture or caas
That þorowe a wyndowe þikke of mony a barre
Of yren grete and square as eny sparre
He cast his eyen vpon Emelia
A þerwiþ al he bleynte and cried A
As þouȝe he stongen were vnto þe hert
And wiþ þat crie Arcyte anon vp stert
And seide Cosyn myne what eileþ þe
That art so pale and dedly on to see
Whi cridest þowe who haþ þe don offence
ffor goddis loue take al in pacience
Our prison for it may noon othere be
ffortune hath ȝeue vs þis aduersite
Som wikke aspecte or disposicion
Of Saturne by som constellacion
Haþ ȝeuen by þis al þouȝe he had hit sworn
So stode þe heuene whan þat we were born
We mote endure it þis is short and playn
This Palamon answerd and seide agayn
Cosyn forsoþ of þis opynyon
Thow hast a veyn ymagynacion
This prison caused me not  to crie
But I was hirt riȝt nowe þorgh out myn ye
Into myn hert þat wil my bane be
The fairnesse of þat lady þat I see
Ȝonde in þe gardyne romyng to and fro
Is cause of al my criyng and my woo 
I not where she be womman or goddesse
But Venus is it soþly as I gesse
And þerwiþal on knees doun he fille
And seide Venus if it be þi wille
Ȝowe in þis gardyne þus to transfigure


Bifore me soriful wrecched creature
Out of þis Prison helpe þat we mowe scape
And if so be my destany be shape
By eterne worde to dyen in prison  
Of oure lynage haue som compassion
That is so lowe ybrouȝt by tyrannye
And wiþ þat word arcite gan aspie
Where as þis lady romed to and froo
And wiþ þat siȝt her bewte hurte hym soo
þat if þat Palamon was wounded sore
Arcite is hurte as moche as he or more
And wiþ a sighe he seide pitously
þe fresshe bewte sleeþ me sodeynly
Of hur þat romeþ in ȝonder place
And but if I haue her mercy and her grace
þat I may seen hir atte leeste way
I ne am but dede þer nys no more to say
This Palamon whan he þise wordes herde
Dispitously he loked and answerde
Wheder seist þou þis in ernest or in pleye
Nay quod Arcite in ernest be my feye
God helpe me so me lest ful euel play
This Palamon gan knytte his browes tway
It were to the quod he no gret honour
ffor to be fals ne for to be traitour
To me þat am þi Cosyn and þi broþer
Isworne ful depe and eche of vs to oþer
That neuere for to dyen in þe peyn
Til þat þe deþe departe shal vs tweyn
Neiþer in loue to hynder oþer
Ne in noon oþer caas my lief broþer
But þat þou shuldest trewly ferþermore
In euery caas and I shal forther þe þore
þis was þine othe and myn also certeyn
I wote riȝt wele þow darst it not wiþseyn
Thus art þow of my counsel out of doute


And nowe þou woldest falsly ben aboute
To loue my lady whom I loue and serue
And euer shal to þat myn herte sterue
Now certes fals Arcite þow shalt not so  
I loued her first and tolde þe my woo
As to my counsaile and my broþer sworn
To forþere me as I haue tolde biforn
ffor which þow art ybounden as a knyght
To helpe me if it lay in þi myght
Or ellis art þou fals I dar wel sayn
This arcite ful prudently spak agayn
Thow shalt quod he be raþer fals þan I
But þou art fals I telle þe witterly
ffor paramour I loued her first þan þou
What wilt þow seyn  þou wist it not ȝit nowe
Whedere she be a womman or goddes
Thyne is affeccion of holynes
And myne is loue as to a creature
ffor which I tolde þe myn auenture
As to my cosyn and to my broþere sworn
I pose þat þou louedest hur biforn
Woost þow not wel þe olde clerkes sawe
Þat who shal ȝeue a louer eny lawe
Loue is a gretter lawe by my pan
þan may be ȝeue to eny erþely man
And þerfor positif lawe and swich decree
Is broke al day for loue in eche degre
A man mote nedes loue mawgre his hede
He may not fleen it þouȝe he shuld be dede
Al be she mayde or widowe or ellis wif
And eke it is not likly al þi liff
To stonden in her grace no more shal I
ffor wel þou woost þi self verrely
þat þou and I bene dampned to prison
Perpetuelly vs geyneth no raunson
We stryuen as  houndes for þe boon


þei foughten alday and ȝit her parte was non
þere come a kite while þat þei were so wroth
þat bare away þe boon bitwene hem both
Ak þerfore at þe kingges courte my brother  
Eche man for him self þer is noon oþer
Loue if þe list for I loue and ay shal
And soþly leue broþer þis is all
Here in þis prison mote we endure
And euerich of vs take his auenture
Grete was þe strif and longe bytwix hem tweye
If þat I had leisere for to seye
But to þis effect I hapned on a day
To tellen yowe as soþly as I may
A worþi duc þat hight Perotheus
þat ffelawe was vnto duc Theseus
Siþ þilk day þat þei weren children lite
Was commen to Athenes his felawe to visite
And forto pley as he was wont to doo
ffor in þis worlde he loued no man soo
And he loued him also tenderly ageyn
So wel þei loued as olde bokes seyn 
That whan þat oon was dede soþly to telle
His felowe went and souȝt him doun in helle
But of þat storie list me not to write
Duc Perotheus loued wel arcite
And had him knowe at Thebes yere by yere
And fynaly at þe request and preiere
Of Perotheus wiþ out ony raunson
Duc theseus him lete out of Prison
ffrely to goon wher þat him list oueral
In suche a gise as I you telle shall
This was þe forward pleynly for to endite
Bitwene Theseus and hym iercite
That if so were þat arcite were founde
Euer in his lif be day or nyȝt or stounde
In eny cuntre of this theseus


And he were kaught it was acorded þus
That wiþ a swerde he shuld lese his hede
Þer nas non oþer remedye ne rede
But takeþ his leue and homward he hym spedde  
Lat hym be war his nek lith to wedde
How grete a sorowe suffreþ nowe arcite
The deth he feleþ þorgh his herte smyte
He wepeþ and weileþ and crieþ pitously
To sleen hym self he waiteth priuely
He saide Allas þat day þat I was born
Now is my prison wors than  beforn
Nowe is me shape eternaly to dwelle
Nouȝt in purgotorye but in helle
Allas þat euere I knewe Perotheus
ffor ellis had I ydwelled with theseus
Yfetered in his prison euermoo
Than had I bene in blisse and not in woo
Only þe sight of her whom þat I serue
Thoow þat I neuere hir grace may deserue
Wold haue ysuffised right ynowe for me
Oo dere Cosyn Palamon quod he
Thine is þe victorie of þis auenture
fful blisfully in prison myȝt þou dure
In prison certes nay but paradis
Wel hath fortune turned þe the dys
þat hast þe sight of hur and I þe absence
ffor possible is siþ þou hast her presence
And art a knyght an worþi and an able
That by som caas siþ fortune is chaungeable
Thowe maiste to þi desire somtyme atteyn
But I þat am exiled and bareyn
Of al grace and in so gret despeir
That þer nys erþe water fuyr ne eire
Ne creature þat of hem maked is
Þat may me helpe or done comfort in þis
Wel ouȝte I sterue in wanhope and distresse


ffare wele my lif my lust and my gladnesse
Allas whi pleynen men so in comune
Of purueaunce of god and of fortune
That ȝeueþ hem ful oft in mony a gyse  
Wel bet þan þei can hem self devise
Som man desireþ forto haue ricchesse
That cause is of his mordere and gret siknesse
And som man wolde out of his prison fayn
That in his hous is of his mayne sclayn
Infinite harmes bene in þis matiere
We wote not what þinge þat we preien here
We faren as he þat dronken is as mous
A dronken man wote wele he haþ an hous
But he ne woote which þe riȝt way is þidere
And to a dronken man þe way is sclydere
And certes in þis world so faren wee
We sechen fast aftere felicite
But we goon wronge ful oft trewly
Thus may we seie alle and namelich I
That wende and had a grete opynyon
That if I myȝte skapen from prison
þan had I be in Ioie and parfite hele
þer nowe I am exiled fro my wele
Siþ þat I may not seen ȝou Emelye
I am but dede þer nys no remedye
Vppon þat oþer side Palamon
Whan þat he wist þat arcite was agon
Swich sorowe he makeþ þat þe grete tour
Resouneþ of his ȝellinge and clamour
The pure fettres of his shynes grete
Were of his bitter salte teeres wete
Allas quod he Arcita cosyn myne
Of al our strif god wote þe fruyte is þine
Thow walkest now in Thebes at þi large
And of my woo þou ȝeuest litel charge
Thow maist siþ þou hast wisdom and manhede


Assemble alle þe folk of our kinrede
And make a werre so sharpe on þis Cite
þat by som auenture or som trete
Thow maist haue hir to lady and to wiff  
ffor whom þat I most nedes lese my liff
ffor as by way of possibilite
Siþ þou art at þi large of prison free
And art a lorde grete is þine auauntage
More þan is myne þat sterue here in a kage
ffor I mote wepe and weile while þat I lyue
Wiþ al þe woo þat prison may me ȝeue
And eke wiþ peyn þat loue me ȝeueþ alsoo
þat doubleþ al my torment and my woo
þer wiþ þe fire of gelesie vpsterte
Wiþ in his brest and hente hym by þe herte
So woodly þat he like was to biholde
The boxtre or þe asshen dede and colde
That seide he o cruel goddes þat gouerne
This world wiþ byndinge of ȝoure worde eterne
And writen in þe table of Athamaunt
Ȝoure parlement and ȝoure eterne graunt
What is mankinde more vnto ȝou holde
Þan is the shepe þat roukeþ in þe folde
ffor sclayn is man riȝt as an oþer beest
And dwelleþ eke in prison and in arest
And haþ siknesse and grete aduersite
And oft tymes giltlees parde
What gouernaunce is in þis prescience
That giltlees tormenteþ Innocence
And encreseþ þis al my penaunce
þat man is bounden to his obseruaunce
ffor goddes sake to letten of his wille
Ther as a beest may al his list fulfille
And whan a beest is dede he hath no peyn
But aftere his deth man mote wepe and pleyn
Thogh in þis world he haue care and woo


Wiþ outen doute it may stonden soo
The answere of þis lete I to dyuynes
But wel I wote þat in þis world gret pyne es
 Allas I se a serpent or a theef  
þat mony an trewe man haþ done meschief
Goon at his large and where hym list may turne
But I mote bene in prison þorgh Saturne
And eke þorghe Iuno Ialous and eke wode
þat haþ destroied wel nygh al þe blode
Of Thebes wiþ his waaste walles wide
And Venus sleeþ me on þat oþer side
ffor Ialousy and fere of him Arcite
Now wil I stinte of Palamon a lite
And lat hym in his prison stille dwelle
And of Arcite forþ I wil ȝowe telle
The somer passeþ and þe nyȝtes longe
Encresceþ double wise þe peynes stronge
Boþen of þe louer and of þe prisoner
I not whiche haþ þe woofuller myster
ffor shortely for to seyn of þis Palamōn
Perpetuelly is dampned to prison
In cheynes and  fettres to þe dede
And Arcite is exiled vp is hede
ffor euermore as out of þat cuntre
Ne neuere ne shal his lady see
 Ȝow louyers aske I now þis questiōn
Who haþ þe wors Arcite or Palamōn
That oon may se his lady day by day
But in Prison mot he dwelle alway
That oþer wher hym list may ride and goo
But seen his lady shal he neuer moo
Now devyneþ as ȝou list þat ȝe can
ffor I wil telle forþ as I byganne


 Whan þat Arcite to Thebes commen was
fful often a daie he swelt and seide alas
ffor seen his lady shal he neuere moo
And shortely to concluden all his woo
So mykel sorowe had neuere creature
þat is or shal while þat þe world may dure
 His slepe his mete his drink is hym byraft  
þat lene he wexeþ and drye as is a shaft
His eyen holowe and grisly to biholde
His hwe falowe and pale as asshen colde
And solitarye he was and euer allone
And waillinge al þe nyȝt making his mone
And if he herde songe or instrument
Than wolde he wepe he myȝt not stent
So feble eke were his spirites  and he lowe
And chaunged so þat no man can knowe
His speche neiþer his voys þouȝe men it herde
And in his gere for al þe worlde he ferde
Not comly liche to louers maladye
Of heres but rather like manye
Engendred of humour malancolike
Byforn his celle fantastike
And shortely turned was al vp and doun
Both habite and disposicioun
Of him þis wooful louer Daine Arcite
What shuld I alday of his woo endite
Whan he endured had a ȝere or two
This cruel torment and þis peyn and woo
At Thebes in his courte as I seide
Vpon a nyght in slepe as he hym leide
Hym þouȝt howe þat the wenged god Mercurye
Biforn him stode and bad hym to be merye
His slepy yeerde in honde he bare vpriȝt
An hatte he wered vpon his heres briȝt


Araied was þis god as he toke kepe
As he was whan þat Argus toke his slepe
And seide him þus to Athenes shalt þou wende
Ther is þe shapen of þi woo an ende
And wiþ þat worde Arcite woke and stert
Nowe trewly howe sore þat euer me smert
Quod he to Athenes nowe wil I fare
Ne for þe drede of deþe shal I not spare
To see my lady þat I loue and serue  
In her presence I ne recche þough I sterue
And wiþ þat word he kaught a grete myrour
And seegh þat chaunged was al his colour
And seegh his visage al in anoþer kinde
And right anon it ranne him in his mynde
That siþen his face was so disfigured
Of malady þe which he had endured
He myghte wel if þat he bare hym lowe
Lyue in Athenes euermore vnknowe
And seen his lady wel nye day be day
And right anon he chaunged his aray
And clad him as a poor labore
And  alon sauf oonly a sqwiere
That knewe his priuete and al his caas
Whiche was disgised poorly as he waas
To Athenes is he gon þe nexte way
And to þe courte he went vpon a day
And at þe gate he profered his seruyse
To drugge and drawe what so men wil deuise
And shortely of þis mater forto seyn
He felle in office wiþ a chamberleyn
The whiche þat was dwelling wiþ Emelye
ffor he was wise and sone couþe aspye
Of euery seruaunte which þat serueþ here
Wel couþe he hewen wode and water bere
ffor he was yonge and myghty for þe nonys
And þerto he was stronge and bigge of bonys


To done þat eny wiȝt him can deuise
A ȝeer or two he was in þis seruyse
Page in þe Chambre of Emely þe briȝt
And Philostrate he seide þat he hiȝt
But half so wel biloued a man as he
Ne was þer neuer in courte of his degre
He was  gentil of Condicioun
þat þorowe out al þe court was his renoun
Thei seide þat it was a charite  
That theseus wolde enhaunce his degre
And putten hym in worshipful seruyse
þer as he myght his vertue exercise
And þus wiþ in a while his name is spronge
Bothen of his dedes and of his good tonge
That Theseus haþ taken hym so nere
þat of his chambere he made hym a squyere
And ȝaue him gold to meyntene his degre
And eke men brouȝt hym out of his cuntre
ffro ȝere to ȝere ful priuely his rente
But honestly and sleiȝly he it spente
That no man wondred how þat he it hadde
And thre ȝere in þis wise his lif he ladde
And bare hym so in pees and eke in werre
þer is no man þat Theseus hath derre
And in þis blisse lete I nowe Arcite
And speke I wil of Palamon a lite
 In derknesse in horrible and strong prison
This vij ȝere hath sitten Palamon
fforpyned what for woo and for distresse
Who feleth double soor and hevynesse
But Palamon þat loue destreyneþ so
That wode out of his wit he goþ for woo
And eke þerto he is a prisonere
Perpetuelly not oonly for a ȝere
Who cowde ryme in englissh proprely
His martierdome for soþ it am not I


Therfor I passe as liȝtly as I may
 It felle þat in þe vij ȝere of May
The iij nyght as olde bokes seyn
þat al þis story telleþ more pleyn
Were it by auenture or be destynye
As whan a þing is shape it shal be
That sone aftere the mydnyȝt Palamon
By helpinge of a frende brak prison
And fleeþ þe Cite fast as he may goo   
ffor he had ȝeue his gaylere drink so
Of a Clerrey made of a certeyn wyne
Wiþ vercotiks and opy of Thebes fyne
þat al þat nyȝt þough þat men wold hym shake
þe Gailler sclepte and myȝte not awake
 And þus he fleeþ as fast as euer he may
þe nyȝt was short and fast by þe day
þat nedes cost he most him self hiden
And til a groue faste ther besiden
Wiþ dredful foote þan stalkeþ Palamon
ffor shortely þis was his opynyon
That in þat groue he wolde hym hide alday
And in þe nyght þan wolde he take his way
To Thebes ward his frendes forto prey
On theseus to helpe hym to werrey
A shortely eiþer he wold lese his liff
Or wynnen Emely to his louely wiff
This is þeffeste and his entente pleyn
 Nowe wil I turne vnto Arcite ageyn
That litel wist howe negh þat was his care
Til þat fortune had kauȝt hym in his snare
The bysy larke massagere of day
Salueþ in her songe þe morowe gray
And ffiry Phebus riseþ vp so briȝt
þat al þe Orient laugheth of his siȝt
And wiþ his stremes drieþ in þe greues 
The siluer dropes honging in þe leues


 And Arcita þat in þe courte Royall
With Theseus his squyer pryncipall
Is risen and lokeþ on þe mery day
And forto don his obseruaunce to Maij
Remembring þe point of his desire
He on his coursere sterting as þe fire
Is riden into þe feeldes him to pley
Out of þe courte were it a myle or twey
And to þe Groue of which þat I ȝou tolde  
By auenture his way bygon to holde
And maken hym a garlond of þe greues
Were it of wodbynde or hawthorn leues
And loude he songe aȝeinst þe sonne shene
May wiþ all þi floures and þi grene
Welcome be þowe faire fresshe May
I hope þat I somme grene gete may
And from his courser wiþ a lusty herte
Into þe Groue ful hastely he sterte
And in a path he romeþ vp and doun
þer as by auenture of þis Palamoun
Was in a busshe þat no man myȝt hym see
ffor soor afferd of his deþ was he
 No þinge ne knewe he þat it was Arcyte
God wote he wold haue trowed it ful lite
But soþ is seide goon sithen mony ȝeres
That feelde hath yen and þe wode haþ eeres
It is ful faire a man to bere hym euene
ffor alday meten men at vnsef steuene
fful litel wote Arcite of his felawe
þat was so nygh to harken of his sawe
ffor in þe busshe he sitteþ now ful stille
Whan þat Arcite had romed al his fille
And songen at the roundel lustely
Into a stody he felle sodeynly
As don þise louers in her queynt geres
Now in þe croppe now doun in þe breres


Now vp nowe doune as Boket in a welle
Riȝt as þe friday soþly forto telle
Now it shyneþ nowe it reyneþ faste
Riȝt so gan gery Venus euer caste
The hertes of her folk riȝt as hir day
Is Gerful riȝt so chaungeþ she aray
Selde is þe friday al þe weke ylike
 Whan þat Arcite had ysonge he gan to sike
And sette hym doune with oute eny more  
Allas quod he þat day þat I was bore
Howe longe Iuno þorgh þi cruelte
Wiltow werryen Thebes þe Citee
Allas ybrought is to confusion
The blood Roial of Cadme and Amphion
Of Cadmus whiche þat was þe first man
That Thebes bilt or first þe toune bygan
And of þe Cite first was corowned kinge
Of his lynage am I and of his ofspringe
By verrey lyne as of þe stok Roiall
And nowe I am so Catif and so thral
That he þat is my mortal enemye
I serue him as his sqwier poorlye
And ȝit doþ me Iuno wel more shame
ffor I dar not beknowe myn owne name
But þer  I was wonte to hiȝt Arcite
Now hight I Philostrate not worþe a myte
 Allas þou felle Mars allas þou Iuno
Thus haþ ȝoure Ire our lynage alfordo
Sauf oonly me and wrecched Palamon
That Theseus martereþ in prison
And ouer al þis to sleen me vtterly
Loue haþ faire his darte so brennyngly
Istiked þorgh my trewe careful herte
That shapen was my deþ arst þan my sherte
Ȝe sleen me wiþ ȝoure yen Emelye
Ȝe ben þe cause wherfore þat I dye


Of al the remenant of myn oþer care
Ne sette I nouȝt the mountance of a tare
So þat I cowde do ouȝt to ȝour plesaunce
And wiþ þat word he felle doun in a traunce
A longe tyme and afterward he vp stert
þis Palamon þat þouȝt þat þorgh  herte
He felte a colde swerde sodeinly glide
ffor Ire he qwoke no lenger wold he bide
 And whan þat he had herde Arcites tale
As he were wode wiþ face dede and pale
He stert hym vp out of the buskes thikke
And seide Arcite fals traitour quykke
Now art þou hent þat louest my lady soo
ffor whom þat I haue al þis peyn and woo
And art my blood and to my counsel sworne
As I ful oft have tolde þe here to forn
And hast byiaped here Duke Theseus
And falsly chaunged hast þi name þus
I wil be dede or ellis þou shalt dye
Thowe shalt not loue my lady Emely
But I wil loue hir oonly and no moo
ffor I am Palamon þi mortel ffoo
And þouȝe þat I no wepen haue in þis place
But out of prison am Istert by grace
I drede nouȝt but eiþer þou shalt dye
Or þou ne shalt not loue Emelye
Chese which þou wilt or þou shalt not asterte
 This Arcite wiþ ful dispitous herte
Whan he hym knewe and had his tale herd
As feers as a lyon pulled out a swerd
And seide þus by god þat sitteþ aboue
Ne it were þat þou art seke and wode for loue
And eke þat þou no wepen hast in þis place
Thow shuldest neuere out of þis groue pace
þat þou ne shuldest dyen of myn honde
ffor I defie þe swerte and þe bonde


Which þat þou seist I haue made to þe
What verrey fool þenk wel þat loue is free
And I wil loue hir mawgre al þi myȝt
But for as moche as þou art a worþi knyȝt
And willest to darreyn hir by bataille
Haue here my trouþe to morwe I nyl not faille
Wiþ outen witting of eny oþere wight  
That here I wil be founden as a knyght
And bringen harneis riȝt ynough for þe
And chese þe best and leue þe worst for me
And mete and drink þis nyghte wil I bringe
Ynough for þe and cloþes for þi beddynge
And if so be þat þou my lady wynne
And sclee me in þis wode þer I am Inne
Thow maist wel haue þi lady as for me
This Palamon answerd I graunte it þe
And þus þei bene departed til a morowe
Whan eche of hem had leide his feiþ to borowe
 O cupide out of al charite
O regne þat wold no felawe haue wiþ þe
fful soþ is seide þat loue ne lordship
Wil not his þonkes haue no felawship
We fynde þat of Arcite and Palamoun
Arcite is riden anon into the toun
And on þe morowe er it were day liȝt
fful priuely two harneys haþ he diȝt
Both suffisaunt and mete to darreyn
The bataille in þe feelde bytwix hem tweyn
And on his hors allone as he was born
He carieþ al his harneys hym biforn
And in þe Groue at tyme and place ysette
This Arcite and þis Palamon ben mette
To chaungen gan þe colour in her face
Right as þe hunters in  reyne of trace
That stondeþ atte gap wiþ a spere
Whan hunted is þe lyon or þe bere


And hereþ him come russhing in þe Greues
And brekeþ both  bowes and þe leues
And þenkeþ here commeth my mortal enemye
Wiþ oute faile he mote be dede or I
ffor eiþer I moot scleen him atte gappe
Or he moot sclee me if þat me myshappe
So feerden  in chaungyng of here hwe  
As fer as euerich of hem oþer knewe
Ther nas no good day ne no saluynge
But streiȝt wiþ oute worde or rehersinge
Euerich of hem helpeþ forto arme oþer
As frendly as he were his owne broþer
And after þat with sharpe speres stronge
They foynen eche at oþer wonder longe
Thow myȝtest wene þat þis Palamon
In his fightinge were a wood lyon
And as  cruel tigre was Arcite
As wilde boores gon þei togider smyte
That frothen white as fome for yre woode
Vp to þe Ancle fought þei in her bloode
And in þis wise I lete hem fighting dwelle
And forþ I wil of Theseus ȝou telle
 The destanye minister generall
That executeþ in þe world ouer all
The purueaunce þat god haþ say bifore
So stronge it is þat þei þe world had it swore
Þe contrarie of a þinge be ye or nay
Ȝit som tyme it shal falle on a day
That falleþ nouȝt eft wiþ in a þousand yere
ffor certeynly our appetites here
Be it of werre or pees or hate or loue
Al is þis rewled by þe sight aboue
This mene I nowe by myghty Theseus
That forto hunte is so desirous
And namely atte grete hert in Maij
That in his bed þer daweþ hym no day


That he nys cladde and redy forto ride
Wiþ hunte and horn and houndes hym biside
ffor in his hunting haþ he swich delite
That it is al his ioye and appetite
To bene hym self þe grete hertes bane
ffor after Mars he serueþ nowe Dyane
Cleer was þe day as I haue told er þis   
And Theseus wiþ al Ioie and blis
Wiþ his ypolita þe faire quene
And Emely cloþed al in grene
On huntinge bene þei riden rially
And to þe Groue þat stode ful fast by
In which þer was an herte as men hym tolde
But Theseus þe streighte way haþ holde
And to þe launde he rideþ hym ful riȝt
ffor þider was þe hert wonte to haue his fliȝt
And ouer a broke and so forþ on his way
This duke wil haue a cours at hym or tway
Wiþ houndes swich as þat him list comaunde
And whan þis duke was come vnto þe launde
Vnder þe sonne he loked anon
He was ware of Arcite and Palamon
That fouȝten breme as it were boles two
The briȝte swerdes wenten to and fro
So hidously þat wiþ þe leest stroke
It semeþ þat it wold fellen an oke
But what þei were no þing he ne wote
This duke his courser wiþ his spores smoote
And at a stert he was atwixe hem twoo
A pulled out a swerde and cried hoo
No more vp peyn of lesing of ȝour hede
By myghty mars he shal anon be dede
That smyteþ eny stroke þat I may sene
But telleþ me what myster men ȝe bene
That ben so hardy forto fiȝten here
Wiþ oute Iugge or oþer officere


 As it were in litel liste ryally
This Palamon answerde hastily
And seide Sir what nedeþ wordes moo
We han þe deþe deserued boþ twoo
Two woful wrecched be we two catyfes
Þat bene encombred of oure owne lifes
And as þow art a riȝtful lorde and Iuge  
Ne ȝeue vs neiþer mercy ne refuge
But scle me furst for seinte Iarite
But slee my felowe eke as wel as me
Or slee hym  for þough þo knowest lite
This is þi mortal ffoo þis is arcite
That from þi londe is banshed on his hede
ffor whiche he haþ deserued to be dede
ffor þis is he þat come vnto þi gate
And saide þat he hight Philostrate
Thus haþ he Iaped þe ful mony a ȝere
And þou hast made him þi chief squyere
And þis is he þat loueþ Emelye
ffor siþ þat day is commen þat I shal dye
I make pleynly my confession
That I am þilk wooful Palamon
That haþ þi prison broken wikkedly
I am þi mortal foo and it am I
That loueþ so hote Emely þe briȝt
That I wil dye present in her siȝt
Wherfore I axe deþ and my Iwes
But scle my felawe in þe same wise
ffor boþe we han deserued forto be sclayn
This worþi duke answerd anon agayn
And saide þis is a short conclusion
Ȝoure owne mouþe be ȝoure confession
Haþ dampned þer ȝou and I wil it recorde
Hit nedeþ not to pyne ȝou wiþ acorde
He shul be dede by myȝty mars þe rede
The quene anoon for verrey wommanhede


Gan  to wepe and so seide Emelye
And al þe ladis in þe companye
Grete pite was it as it þouȝt hem alle
That euere such a chaunce shuld byfalle
ffor gentil men þei were of grete astate
And no þinge but for loue was þis debate
And seegh her blody woundes wide and sore  
And alle criden boþ lasse and more
Haue mercy vpon vs wommen alle
And on her bare knees doun þei falle
And wold han kissed his fete þer he stoode
Til at þe last asclaked was his moode
ffor pite renneþ sone in gentile herte
And þoughe he first for ire quoke and sterte
He haþ considered shortly in a clause
The trespase of hem both and þe cause
And al þouȝe his Ire her gilt accused
Ȝit in his reson he hem both excused
And þus he þouȝte wel þat euery man
Wol helpe him self in loue if þat he can
And eke delyuere him self out of prison
And eke him self had compassion
Of wommen for þei wepen euere in oon
And in his gentile hert he þouȝt anōn
And soft vnto him self he seide fye
Vpon a lord þat wil haue no mercy
But be a lyon boþe in word and dede
To hem þat bene in repentaunce and drede
As wel as to a prowde dispitous man
That wil meytene þat he first bygan
That lord haþ litel in discreccion
That in such caas can no diuision
But weieþ pride and humblenesse after oon
And shortely whan his Ire was þus agon
He gan to loken vp wiþ eyen light
And spake þise same wordes al on hight


The god of love o Benedicite
How myghty and howe grete a lord is he
Aȝeinst his myght þer ȝeyneþ non obstacles
He may be cleped a god for his myracles
ffor he can maken at is owne gyse
Of euerich hert as þat hym list devise
Lo here þis arcite and þis Palamon  
That quietely were out of prison gon
And myght haue lyued in thebes Rially
And weten I am her mortal enemye
And þat her deþ is in  myght also 
And ȝit haþ loue mawgre her eyen two
Brouȝt him hidere boþ forto dye
Now lokeþ is not þis a grete folye
Who may be a fool but if he loue
Biholde for goddes loue þat sitteþ aboue
See howe þei blede bene þei not wel araied
Thus haþ her lorde þe god of loue hem paied
Her wages and her fees for her seruise
And ȝit þei wenene for to bene ful wise
That seruen loue for ouȝt þat may bifalle
But ȝit is þis þe beste game of alle
That she for whom þei haue þis Iolite
Can hem as moche thonke as me
Shee wote no more of al þis hote fare
By god þan wote an Cuckowe or an hare
But al most be assaied hote and cold
A man mote be a fool or ȝonge or old
I wote it by my self for yore agone
ffor in my tyme a seruaunte was I oone
And þerfor sith I knowe of loues peyne
And wote howe sore it can a man distreyne
As he þat haþ oft bene cauȝt in his laas
I ȝou forȝiue al holy þis trespaas 
Atte request of þe quene þat kneleþ here
And eke of Emelye my suster dere


And ȝe shul boþe vnto me swere
That neuermore ȝe shul my cuntre dere
Ne make werre vpon me nyȝt ne day
But bene my frendes in al þat ȝe may
I nowe forȝeue þis trespase euery dell
And þei hym swore his axing fair and well
And him of lordship and of mercye preide  
And so hem graunteþ grace and þus he seide
To speke of Rial lynage and ricches
Thoo þat she were a quene or a princesse
Eche of ȝou boþe is worþi doutelees
To wedden whan tyme is but naþelees
I speke as for my suster Emelye
ffor whoom ȝe haue þis strif and Ielosie
Ȝe wote ȝoure self ze may not wedden two
At ones þouȝe ȝe fiȝten euermoo
þat oon of ȝou be he loþ or liefe
He mot go pipen in an yve liefe
This is to say she may not nowe haue both
Ne be ȝe neuere so Ielous and so wroth
And forþi þer nowe put in þis degre
That eche of ȝou shal haue his destane
As him is shape and harkeneþ in what wise
Lo here ȝoure ende and þat I shal devise
 My wille is þis for plat conclusion
Wiþ oute eny replicacion
Ȝif þat ȝou likeþ take it for þe best
That euery of ȝou shal go wher hym lest
ffrely wiþ outen raunson  daungere
At þis day fifty wekes fer ne nere
Euerich of ȝou shal bryng an C knyȝtes
Armed for listes vp al rightes
Al redy to darreyn hir by batayle
And þis bihote I ȝou wiþ outen faile
Vpon my trouþe and as I am a knyȝt
þat wheder of ȝou boþ þat haþ myȝt


This is to seyn þat whedere he or þowe
May wiþ his hundred as I haue spoke of nowe
Slee his contrary or out of lystes drive
Than shal I ȝeue hym Emely to wyve
To whom þat fortune haþ ȝeue so faire a grace
The listes shal I do maken in þis place
And god so wisly on my soule rwe  
As I shal cuene Iuge be and trwe
Ȝe shal non oþere ende wiþ me make
þat oon of ȝou shal be dede or take
And if yow þenke þis is wel yseide
Sey ȝoure avice and holde ȝou wel apaide
This is ȝoure ende and ȝour conclusion
Who lokeþ lightly now but Palamon
Swo springeth vp for Ioie but Arcite
Who coude telle or who coude it endite
The Ioie þat is made in þat place
Whan Theseus haþ don so faire a grace
But doune on knees went euery manere wiȝt
And thonked hym wiþ al her hert and myȝt
And namely þise Thybeanes mony sith
And þus wiþ hope and herte blith
Thei take her leue and homward gan þei ride
Tho Thebesward wiþ olde walles wide
    
 I trowe men wolde deme it necligence
If I forȝete to telle þe dispence
Of Theseus þat goþ so bisily
To maken vp þe listes rially
That suche a noble theatre as it was
I dar wel seyn in þis world ther nas
The circuyte a myle was aboute
Walled wiþ stone and dicched al wiþ oute
Rounde was þe shappe in mancre of a compas 


fful of degrees þe heght of sixty paas
That whan a man was sette on oon degre
He letted not his felawe forto see
Estward þer stode a gate of Marbel white
Westward right such a noþer in þe opposite
And shortely to conclude such a place
Was non in erþe as in so litel space
ffor in þe londe þer nas no crafty man
That Geometrye or arsmetrike can
Ne purtraiour ne keruer of ymages  
That Theseus ne ȝaue him mete and wages
The theater to make and to devise
And forto doon his riȝt and his sacrifise
He Estward haþ on þe gate aboue
In worship of wenus goddes of loue
Done maken an awtere and an oratorie
And on þe westward side in memorie
Of Mars he haþ maked riȝt such anoþere
þat cost largely of gold a ffoþere
And norþward in a tourett on þe wall
Of Alabaster white and rede Corall
An oratorie riche forto see
In worship of Diane of chaastite
Haþ Theseus done wrouȝt in noble wise
But ȝit had I forgete forto devise
That noble kervingges and þe pourtratures
þe shappe þe countenaunce and þe figures
þat weren in þe oratories thre
ffirst in þe temple of Venus maist þou see
Wrouȝt on þe walle ful pitous to biholde
þe broken slepes and þe sighes colde
þe sacred teeres and þe waymentynge
þe firy strokes of þe desiringe
þat loues seruauntes in þis lif enduren
þe Oþes þat her conauntes assuren
Plesaunce and hope desire foolhardynesse


Beaute and þouȝt bawdry richesse
Charmes and force lesingges and flaterye
Dispence bysynesse and Ielowsie
þat wered of ȝolowe goldes a garlonde
And a Cukkowe sitting on her honde
ffeestes instrumentes Carolles daunces
Iuste and array and al þe circumstaunces
Of loue whiche I rekened and reken shall
By ordere were peynted on þe wall
And mo þan I con  of menciōn  
ffor soþly al þe mōnt of Citharōn
Ther Venus haþ her principal dwellinge
Was shewed in þe walle in purtraiynge
Wiþ al þe Gardeyne and þe lustynesse
Not was forȝeten þe porter ydelnesse
Ne narcisus þe faire of yore agone
Ne ȝit þe foly of king salamon
Ne ȝit þe grete strengthe of hercules
þe enchauntementz of Medea and certes
Ne of Turnus wiþ þe hardy fires corage
þe riche Cresus catif in seruage
Thus may ȝe sene þat wisdom ne ricchesse
Bewte ne scleighte strengthe hardynesse
Ne may with Venus holde chaumpartie
ffor as her list þe world þan may she gie
 Loo alle þise folk so caught were in her las
To þei for woo ful often seide alas
Suffiseþ here oon ensample or two
And þoughe þer coude rekne a thousand moo
The statue of Venus glorious to see
Was naked fletinge in þe large see
And from þe nauel doun al keuered was
Wiþ wawes grene and briȝt as eny glas
A Citole in hire riȝte hond had she
And on her hede ful semely to see
A Rose garlonde fresshe an wel smellinge


Aboue her hede her dowues flateringe
Byfore hir stode hir sone Cupido
Vpon his shulders wenges had he two
And blynde he was as it is ofte sene
A bowe he bare and arowes briȝt and kene
 Whi shuld I not eke as wel telle ȝou alle
The pourtrature þat was vpon þe walle
Wiþ in þe temple of myȝty mars þe rede
Al peynted was þe walle in lengthe and brede
Like to þe Estres of þe grisly place  
þe hight þe grte temple of Mars in trace
In þilk colde frosty Regyōn
Ther as Mars haþ his souereyn manciōn
 ffirst on þe walle was peynted a foreste
In which þer wonneþ neiþer man ne beste
Wiþ knotty knarry bareyn trees olde
Of stubbes sharpe and hidous to biholde
In which þer was a rombled and a swoghe
As þough a storme shuld breke euery bouȝe
And dounward  from an hille vnder a bent
There stode þe temple of Mars Armypotent
Wrought of al of burnyd steel of which þe entent
Was longe and streit and goostly forto sent
And þer out came a rage in such a wise
Þat it made al þe gates forto rise
Til norþeron liȝt in at þe doores shoōn
ffor wyndowe on þe wall þan was þer nōn
þorowe whiche men myȝt eny light discerne
þe door was al of Athamant eterne
Yclenched ouertwert and endelonge
Wiþ Iren towe forto make it stronge
Euery piler þe temple to sustene
Was tonne grete of yren briȝt and shene
Ther seghe I furst þe  ymagynyng
Of felowny and al þe compassing
The cruel Ire rede as eny gleede


þe Pikpurs and eke þe pale drede
þe smyler wiþ þe knyf vnder þe cloke
þe shippen brennyng wiþ þe blak smoke
þe treson of þe morþering in þe bedde
þe open werre wiþ woundes al bybledde
Conteckte wiþ blody knyff and sharpe manace
Al ful of chirkinge was þat sory place
Þe scleer of him self ȝit segh I þere
His hertebloode haþ baþed al his here
The nayle ydryuen in þe shode a nyȝt  
Wiþ colde deþe wiþ mouþe gaping vp riȝt
Amyddes of þe temple satte a meschaunce
Wiþ discomfort and sori countenaunce
Ȝit saughe I woodnesse laughing in his rage
Armed compleint outhees and fires corage
Þe Careyn in þe bussh wiþ þrote ycorve
A thousand sclayne and not of qualme ystorue
This tyraunt wiþ þe pray by force yrafte
þe toune destroied þer nas no þing ylafte
Ȝit seghe I brent þe shippes Hoppesteres
The hunte strāngled wiþ þe wilde beres
The sowe fretinge þe childe riȝt in þe cradell
The Coke yscalded for al his longe ladell
Nouȝt was forgeten by þe infortune of Marte
The Carter ouerriden wiþ þe Carte
Vndere þe whele ful lowe he lay adoun
þere were also of Martes dyuysioun
þe Barboure þe bochere and þe Smyth
þat forgeþ sharpe swerdes on þe stith
And al aboue depeynted in a toure
Saughe I conquest sittinge in grete honoure
Wiþ þe sharpe swerde ouer his hede
Hanginge by a sotile twyned þrede
Depeinted was þe the sclauughter of Iuliu
Of grete Nero and of Anthoneus
Al be þat þilke tyme þei were vnborn


Ȝit was her deþ depeinted þer biforn
By manasing of Mars riȝt by figure
so was it shewed in þe purtrature
As is depeinted in þe certres aboue
Who shal be ded or slayne for loue
Suffiseþ oon ensample in stories olde
I may not rekne hem al þouȝe I wolde
þe statue of mars vpon a carte stode
Armed and loked grymme as he were wode
And ouer his hode þer shyneþ two figures  
Of sterres þat bene cleped in figures
That oon Puella that oþer rubeus
This god of armes was araied þus
A wolf þer stode to forn him at his fete
Wiþ eyen rede and of a man he ete
Wiþ sotel pensel was depeynted þis storie
In recordinge of Mars and  his glorie
 Nowe to þe temple of Dyane þe chaste
As shortely as I can I wil me haste
To telle ȝou al the descripcioun
Depeynted was þe walle vp and doun
Of huntinge and of shamfast chastite
þer saughe I how wooful calistope
Whan þat Dyane agreued was  here
Was turned from a womman to a bere
And after was she made þe lodesterre
Thus was she peynted I can say ȝou no ferre
Her sone is eke a sterre as ȝe may see
þer saughe I dane turned to a tree
I mene not þe goddes Dyane
But Penneus doughter which þat hiȝte dane
þer saugh I Attheon an hert ymaked
ffor vengeaunce þat he segh diane al naked
I saugh þat how his houndes haue hym caughte
And freten him for þei knewe hym nauȝte
Ȝit ypeynted was a litel ferþermore


Howe Atthelaunt hunted þe wilde bore
And maleagre and mony oþer moo
ffor whiche diane wrouȝt hym care and woo
Ther seghe I many anoþer worþi story
Whiche men list not to drowe to memory
This goddes vpon an hert ful wel she sette
Wiþ smale houndes al about her fete
And vnderneþe her fete she had a mone
Wexing it was and shal wany sone
In gaudy grene her statue cloþes was  
Wiþ bowe in honde and arowes in a cas
Her eyen keste she ful lowe a doune
Ther Pluto haþ his derke regioun
A woman travailing was hir biforn
But for her child was so longe vnborn
fful pitously lucyna can she calle
And seide helpe for þou maist best of alle
Wel coude he peynte lyvely þat it wrouȝt
Wiþ mony a floreyne he þe coloures bouȝt
 Now bene þise listes made and theseus
That at his grete cost araied þus
þe temple and þe theatre euery dele
Whan it was done him liked wonder wele
But stint I wil of Theseus a lite
And speke of Palamon and  arcite
The  approcheþ of her retournynge
þat eueriche shuld an C knyghtes bringe
The bataille to darrey as I you tolde
And to Athenes her couenaunte forto holde
Haþ euery of hem brouȝt an C knyghtes
Wel armed for þe werre at al rightes
And sikerly þer trowed many a man
That neuere siþ þat þe world bygan
That forto speke of knyghthode of her honde
As fer as god haþ maked see or londe
Nas of so fewe so noble a companye


ffor euery wight þat loued chivalrye
And wold his þonkes haue a passaunte name
Haþ preide þat he myght be of þat game
And wel was him þat þerto chosen was
ffor if þer felle to morow such a caas
Ȝe knowen wel þat euery lusty knyȝt
þat loueþ paramours and haþ  myȝt
Were it in engelonde or ellis where
þei wolden fayne wilnen to be þere
To fight for a lady O benedicite  
It were a lusty sighte forto se
And right so feerden þei wiþ Palamon
Wiþ hym þei wenten knyghtes mony on
Som wol be armed in an haberiōn
And a brest plate and a litel gippōn
And some wil haue a peire plates large
And some wil haue a Spruse plate sheeld or targe
Somme wil  armed on his legges welle
And haue an axe and some a mace of stele
þer nas no newe gyse þat it nas olde
Armed were þei as I haue ȝou tolde
Euerich after his opynyōn
Ther maist þou see commyng with Palamon
Ligurge hym self þe grete king of trace
Blak was his visage and manly was his face
þe Cercles of þe eyen in his hede
þei glowden bitwix ȝelowe and rede
And liche a lyon loked he aboute
With kempte heeres on his browes stoute
His lymes grete his brawnes stronge
His sholdres brode his armes rounde and longe
And as þe Gyse was in his cuntre
fful heghe vpon a chare of gold stode he
Wiþ iiij white boles in þe trais
In stede of cote armure and his harnais
Wiþ nailles ȝelowe and briȝt as eny gold


He had a berres skyn coleblake for olde
His longe heer was kempte behinde his bak
As eny rauens feþere it shoon for blak
A wreþe of gold arme briȝt of huge wiȝt
Vpon his hede sette ful of stonys briȝt
Of fyne Rubies and of dyamauntz
About his chare þer went white alauntz
xxti and moo as grete as ony ster
To hunten at þe lyon or þe deer
And folowed hym wiþ mosel fast ybounde  
Colers of golde and torrettes philed rounde
An C lordes had he in his route
Armed ful wel wiþ hertes steerne and stoute
 With Arcite in stories as men fynde
The grete Emetreus þe king of ynde
Vpon a stede bay trapped in stele
Couered wiþ a cloþe of gold diapred wele
Come riding liche þe god of armed Mars
His cote armure was a cloþe of tars
Couched wiþ peerles white rounde and grete
His sadel was of brent gold newe ybete
A mantel vpon his shulder hongynge
Bretful of rubies rede as fire sparlinge
His Crispe here liche rynges was yronne
And þat was ȝelowe and glitering as þe sonne
His nose was heghe his eyen briȝt citryn
His lippes rounde his colour was Sangwyn
A fewe frakens in his face spreynt
Bitwix ȝelowe and somdele blak ymeynt
And as a lyon he is eyen caste
Of xxvti ȝere his age y caste
His beerd was wel bygonne forto springe
His vois was as a trompet þondringe
Vpon his hede he wered a laurer grene
A garlond fresshe and lusty forto sene
Vpon his honde he bare for his delite


An Egle tame as eny lylye white
An C lordes had he wiþ hym þere
Al armed sauf her hedes in al her gere
fful richely in al maner þingges
ffor trusteþ wel þat dukes Erles kyngges
Were gadered in þis noble companye
ffor loue and for encrees of chyualrye
About þis knyȝt þer ranne on euery part
fful mony a tame lyon and leopart
And in þis wise þise lordes al and some  
Bene on þe sonday to þe Cite come
Aboute prime and in þe toun alight
This Theseus þis duke þis worþi knyȝt
Whan he had brouȝt hem into his Cite
And Inned hem  after her degre
He feesteth hem and doþ so gret laboure
To esen hem and done hem al honoure
That ȝit men wenen þat no mannys witte
Of noon astate ne cowde amenden it
The mynstralsy þe servise at þe feest
The grete ȝiftes to þe most and leest
The riche aray of Theseus palays
Ne who sat first and laste vpon þe dees
What ladies fairest bene or best daunsinge
Or whiche of hem can beste daunce or singe
Ne who most felingly spekeþ of loue
What hawkes sitten or perche aboue
What houndes liggen on þe floor adoun
Of al this nowe I make no mencyoun
But al þe effecte þat þenkeþ me þe best
Nowe commeþ þe poynt herkneþ if ȝou lest
 The sonday nyght er day gan to springe
Whan Palamon þe larke herd singe
Al þouȝe it ner not day by howres two
Ȝit songe þe larke and Palamon riȝt þoo
Wiþ holy hert and wiþ an highe corage


He roos vp to weden on his pilgrymage
Vnto þe blisful Cithera benygne
I mene Venus honurable and digne
And in her houre he walkeþ forþ apaas
Vnto þe listes þer þe tempel was
And doune he kneleþ and wiþ humble chere
And herte sore he seide as ȝe shal here
 ffairest o faire o lady myne Venus
Douȝtere to Ioue and spouse to Vlcanus
Thow glader of þe mounte of Citheroun  
ffor þilk loue þou haddest to adoun
Haue pite on my bitter teeres smerte
And take myn humble preier at þine herte
Alas I ne haue no langage to telle
Þe effecte ne þe tourment of myn helle
Myne herte may myn armes not bewreye
I am so confused þat I can not seye
But mercy lady briȝt þat woost wele
My þouȝt and seest what harmes I fele
Considere al þis and rwe vpon my sore
As wisly as I shal for euermore
Hensforþ my myȝt þi trewe seruaunte be
And hole werre alwaie wiþ chaastite
That make I myne avowe so as ȝe may helpe
I kepe not of armes for to ȝelpe
Ne I ne axe not to morowe to haue victorie
Ne renoun in þis caas ne veynglorie
Of price of armes blowen vp and doun
But I wold haue fully possessioun
Of Emelye and dye in her seruise
ffynde þou þe manere howe and in what wise
I recche not but it may better be
To haue victorie of hem or þei of me
So that I haue my lemman in myn armes
ffor þouȝe so be þat mars is god of armes
Ȝoure vertue is so grete in heuene aboue


þat if þe lest I shal wel haue my loue
Thy tempel shal I worship euermoo
And on þine awtere wher I ride or goo
I wil doon sacrifise and fires bete
And ȝif ȝe wil not so my lady swete
þan prey I ȝou to morowe wiþ a spere
þat Arcita me þorghe þe herte bere
Then rekke I not whan I haue lost my lif
þouȝe Arcita wynne her to his wiff
This is þe effecte and eende of my priere  
Ȝeue me my lady þou blisful lady dere
 Whan þe orison was dōn of Palamōn
His sacrifise he did and þat anōn
fful pitously wiþ al circumstaunces
Al telle I not as nowe his obseruaunces
But atte laste þe statue of Venus shoke
And made a signe wherby þat he toke
Þat his preier accepted was þat day
ffor þouȝe þe signe shewed a delay
Ȝit wist he wele þat graunted was his bone
And wiþ glad hert he went awaie ful sone
 þe iij houre inequal þat Palamon
Byganne to venus temple forto gon
Vp roos þe sonne and vp roos Emelye
And to þe temple of Dyane gan she hie
Hir maidens þat she þider wiþ hir ladde
fful redily wiþ hem þe fire þei hadde
þe encense þe cloþes and þe remenaunte all
þat to þe sacrifise longen shall
þe hornes ful of meth as was þe gise
þer lacked nouȝt to don her sacrifise
Smoking þe temple ful of cloþes faire
This Emelie wiþ herte debonaire
Hir lady wasshe wiþ water of a welle
But howe she did hir riȝt I dar not telle
But it be eny þing in generall


And ȝit it were a game to here it all
To him þat meneþ wel it were no charge
But it is good a man be at his large
Hir briȝt heres were kempte vntressed all
A corone of a grene oke seriall
Vpon her hede was sette ful faire and mete
Two fires on þe awter gan she bete
And did her þingges as men may biholde
In stace of Thebes and þise bokes olde
Whan kindeled was þe fire wiþ pitous chere  
Vnto Diane she spake as ȝe may here
 O chaaste goddes of þe wodes grene
To whoom boþ heuene and erþe and see is sene
Quene of  regne of Polute derk and lowe
Goddes of maydenes þat myn hert hast knowe
fful mony a ȝere and woost what I desire
As kepe me from þi vengeance and þine Ire
That attheon abouȝte cruelly
Chaast goddes wel woost þou that I
Desire to be a maiden al my liff
Ne neuere wil I be  loue ne wiff
I am þou woost ȝit of þi companye
A maide and loue huntyng and venerye
And for to walke in þe wodes wilde
And not to be a wiff and be wiþ childe
Nat wil I knowe company of man
Now helpe me lady siþ ȝe may and can
ffor þoo þre formes þat þou hast in þe
And Palamon þat haþ such loue to me
And eke Arcite þat loueþ me so sore
This grace I prei þe wiþ out more
And sende loue and pees ytwyx hem twoo
And fro me turne away her hertes so
That al her hote loue and her desire
And al her bysy torment and her fire
Be queynt or turned in an oþere place


And if so be þou wilt do me no grace
Or if it be my destany be shaped soo
That I shal nedes haue oon of hem two
As sende me him þat most desireþ me
Biholde goddesse of clene chaastite
The bitter teeres þat on my chekes falle
Siþ þou art maide and keper of vs alle
My maydenhode þou kepe and wel conserue
And while I lif a maiden I wil þe serue
þe fires brenne vpon þe Auter clere  
While Emely was þus in his preiere
But sodeynly she seghe a þinge queynt
ffor right anoon oon of þe fires queynt
And quicked ageyn and after þat anōn
That oþer fire was queynt and al agōn
And as it queint it made a qwistelinge
As done þise wete brondes in her brennynge
 And at þe brondes eende out ranne anōn
As it were blody dropes mony ōn
ffor which so sore agaste was Emelie
þat she was wel nyghe madde and gan to crye
ffor she ne wiste what it signified
But only for þe fire þus she criede
And wepte þat it was pite for to here
And þer wiþ al Diane gan to apere
Wiþ bowe on hond right as an hunteresse
And seide douȝtere stint of þine heuynesse
And monge the goddes high it is affermed
And by eterne worde writt and confermed
þow shalt be wedded vnto oon of þoo
þat han for þe so moche care and woo
But vnto which of hem I may not telle
ffare wele I may no lenger dwelle
þe fire whiche þat on myn awter brenne
Shal þe declaren er þat þou go henne
Thine aventure of loue as in þis caas


And with þat worde þe Arowes in þe caas
Of þe goddes clateren fast and ringe
And forþ she went and made a vanysshinge
ffor whiche þis Emely astonyed was
And seide what mounteth þis alas
I put me in þi protectiōn
Diane and in þi disposiciōn
And home she goþ þe neste way
This is þe effecte þer is no more to say
Þe nexte houre of Mars folowing þis  
Arcite vnto þe temple ywalked is
Of feers mars to done his sacrifise
Wiþ al þe myghtes of his peynymes wise
Wiþ pitous hert and heghe deuociōn
Riȝt þus to Mars he seide his Orison
 O stronge god þat in the regnes colde
Of taars honoured art and lord yholde
And hast in euery regne and euery londe
Of armes al þe bridel in þine honde
And hem fortunest as þe list devise
Accepte of me my pitous sacrifise
If so be my þouȝte may deserue
And þat my myght be worþi forto serue
Thi godhede þat I may be oon of þine
Þan preie I þe to rwe vpon my pyne
ffor þilk peyn and þat hoote fire
In which þou brentest whilom for desyre
Whan þou vsedist the beaute
Of faire yonge fresshe venus free
And haddest hure in armes at þi wille
All þoughe þe onys on a tyme mysfelle
Whan vlcanus had kauȝt þe in his laas
And foonde þe ligging be his wif alaas
ffor thilk sorowe þat was in þine herte
Haue rauthe as wel vpon my peynes smerte
I am ȝonge and vnkonyng as þou wooste


And as I trowe wiþ loue offended moste
þat euere was eny lyues creature
ffor she þat doþ me al this woo endure
Ne recheþ neuere wher I sinke of flete
And wel I wote ere she me mercy hete
I mote wiþ strengthe wynne her in þis place
And wel I wote wiþ outen helpe or grace
Of þe ne may my strengthe not availe
Than helpe me lord to morowe in my bataile
ffor þilk fire þat whilom brente þe  
As wel as þat fire now brenneþ me
And do þat I to morowe haue victorie
Myne be þe travaile and þine be þe glorie
Þi souereyn temple wil I most honouren
Of eny place and alway most labouren
In þi plesaunce and in þi craftes stronge
And in þi temple I wil my baner honge
And all þe armes in my companye
And euermore vnto þe day I dye
Eterne fire I wil byfore þe fynde
And eke to þis awowe I wil me bynde
My lorde my here þat hongeþ lowe a dowe
þat neuere ȝit ne felt offencioun
Of rasoure ne of shere I wil þe ȝeue
And bene þi trewe seruaunte while I lyue
Now lord haue rouþe vpon my sorowes sore
Ȝif me þe victorie I axe þe no more
The preier stint of Arcita þe stronge
The Ryngges on þe tempel door ȝit honge
And eke the doors clateren ful fast
Of whiche Arcita somwhat hym agast
The fires brennen vpon þe auter briȝt
That it gan al the temple for to light
And swete smelle anoon þe grounde vp ȝaf
And Arcita anon his honde vp haf
And more ensense vnto þe fire he cast


Wiþ oþer riȝtes moo and atte last
The statue of Mars bygan his hauberk rynge
And wiþ þat soune he herde a murmurynge
fful lowe and dym þat seide þus victorie
ffor which he ȝaue to mars honour and glorie
An þus wiþ Ioie and hope wel to fare
Arcita is brouȝt of Moche care
As fayn as foule is of þe briȝte sonne
And riȝt anon such strif is bygonne
ffor þilk grauntyng in þe heuene aboue  
Bytwix venus þe goddes of loue
And Mars þe steerne god armypotent
Þat Iubiter was bysy it to stent
Til at þe  Pale Saturnus þe colde
Þat knewe so mony of auentures olde

Þat he ful sone haþ plesed every part
And sooþ is seide elde haþ grete auauntage
And elde is boþ wisdome and vsage
Men may þe olde attenne but not atrede

Al be it þat it is aȝeinst his kinde
Of al his strif he can remedye fynde
My dere doughter Venus quod saturne
My cours þat haþ so wide forto turne
Haþ more powere þan wote eny man
Myne is þe drenchinge in þe see so wan
Myne is þe prison in þe derke cote
Myn is þe stranglinge and þe hanging by þe þrote

While I dwelle in þe signe of the lyōn
Myne is þe Ruyne of he heghe halles
Þe fallinge of þe toures and of þe walles
Vpon þe mynour or vpon þe carpentere

And myn be þe maladies colde

Nowe wepe no more I shal do my diligence
That Palamon þat is þine owne knyȝt
Shal haue his lady as þou hast  hiȝt
Thouȝe Mars shal helpe his knyȝt ȝit naþelees
Bytwix ȝou tweyne þer mot be somtyme pees
Al be ȝe not of oon complexiōn  
That causeþ al day such dyuysion
I am þine eile redy at þi wille
Wepe no more I wil þi lust fulfille
Now wil I stinten of þise goddes aboue
Of Mars and of venus goddes of loue
And pleynly I wil telle ȝou as I can
Þe grete effecte for which þat I biganne
     
Grete was þe feest in Athenes þat day
And eke þat lusty seson in  may
Made euery wight to be in suche plesaunce
And al þat day Iusten þei and daunce
And spenden it in Venus high seruyse
But by þe cause þat þei shulden rise
Erly forto seen þe grete fight
Vnto her reste went þei atte nyght
And on þe morowe whan day gan to springe
Of hors and harnays noyse and clateringe
Þer was in hostelrye aboute
And to þe palaies rode þer mony a route
Of lordes vpon stedes and palfreis
þer maist þou see dyvising of harneis
So vncouþe and so riche and wrouȝt so well
Of Goldsmythrie of browding and of steell


The sheeldes briȝte teesteers and trappures
Goldhewen helmes hauberkes and cote armures
Lordys in parementis on her coursers
Knyghtes of retenue and eke swiers
Nailinge þe speres and helmes bokelinge
Sigyng of sheeldes wiþ layvers lasinge
Ther as nede is þei were no þing ydell
þe ffomynge steedes on þe golden bridell
Snavyng and fast þe armurers also
Wiþ file and hamure riding to and froo
Ȝemen on foote and comons many on
Wiþ shorte staues þikke as þei may gon
Pipes trompettes nakerns and clariouns  
Þat in þe bataille blewen blody sownes
Þe paleis ful of puple vp and doun
Here þre þer ten holdinge her questioun
Dyuynyng of þise thibeanes knyȝtes twoo
Some seide þus some seide it shal be so
Somme helde wiþ him wiþ þe blake berde
Somme wiþ þe balled some with þe þikke hered
Some seide he loked grymme and he wold fight
He haþ a sparþe of xxti pounde wight
þus was þe halle ful of dyuynynge
Longe aftere þe sonne gan to springe
þe grete Theseus of his slepe gan wake
Wiþ mynstralcie and nois þat þei make
Heelde ȝit þe chambre of his palais riche
Til þat þe thebeane knyghtes boþ yliche
Honoured weren into þe place fette
Duke Theseus is at þe wyndowe sette
Araide riȝt as he were a god in trone
The puple presed þidereward ful sone
Him forto seen and done him high reuerence
And eke to harken his heest and his sentence
An herowde on a scaffold made an oo 
Til al þe noise of þe puple was doo


And whan he see þe puple of noise al stille
Thus shewed he þe myȝty dukes wille
Þe lord haþ of his heghe discreciōn
Considered þat it were destrucciōn
To gentel blood to feghten in þis gise
Of mortall bataile now in þis emprise
Wherfore to shapen þat þei shal not die
He wille his firste purpoos modefie
No man þerfor vp peyne of losse of liff
No maner shotte ne pollax ne short knyff
Into þe listes sende or þidere bringe
Ne shorter swerd forto stoke wiþ poynt bitinge
No man ne drawe ne bere it be his side  
Ne no man shal vnto his felawe ride
But oon cours wiþ a sharpe grounden spere
ffoyn if hym list on foote hym self to were
And he þat is at meschief shal be take
And not sclayn but be brouȝt to a stake
þat shal be ordeyned on eiþer side
But þidere he shal be foorce and þer abide
And if so falle þe Chevetayn be take
On eiþer side or ellis sclayn his make
No lenger shal þe tornamente laste
God spede ȝou goo and leye on faste
Wiþ swerdes and longe maces fiȝteþ ȝour fille
Go nowe ȝoure way þis is þe lordes wille
The vois of puple touched heuene
So loude cried þei wiþ mery steuene
God saue suche a lord þat is so good
He wilneþ no distruction of blood
Vp goþ þe trompes and þe melody
And to þe listes ritt þe company
By ordinaunce þorghe out þe cite large
Honged wiþ cloþes of gold and not wiþ sarge
fful like a lorde þis noble duc gan ride
Thise two Thebeanes on eiþer syde


And aftere rode þe quene and Emelye
And after þat a nother companye
Of oon and oþer after her degre
And þus þei passen þorgh out þe Cite
And to the listes come þei be tyme
It nas not of þe day ȝit fully pryme
Whan sette was Theseus ful riche and hie
Ypolita þe quene and Emely
And oþer ladies in degrees aboute
Vnto þe setes preesen al þe route
And westward þorgh þe gates vnder mart 
Arcite and eke þe hundred of his part
With banere rede is entred riȝt anōn  
And in þat self moment Palamōn
Is vnder venus estward in þat place
With baner white and hardy chere and face
And in al þe world to seken vp and doun
So euene wiþ out variacioun
Þer nere suche companys tweye
ffor þer nas noon so wise þat coude seie
That eny had of oþer auauntage
Of worthynesse ne of estate ne age
So euen were þei chosen forto gesse
And in to ringges faire þei hem dresse
Whan þat her names redde were euerechon
þat in her nombre gile were þer nōn
Tho were þe gates shette and cried was loude
Do now ȝoure devoire yonge knyȝtes proude
The herawdes left her prikking vp and doun
Now ryngen trompes loude and claryoun
Þer is no more to seyn  est and west
In goon þe sharpe speres ful sadly into þarest
In goþ þe sharpe spere into þe side
Þere seen men who can iuste and who can ride
Þere shyueren shaftes vppon sheeldes þikke
He fileth þorgh þe herte spone þe prikke


Vp springen speres xxti fote on hight
Out goon þe swerdes as þe siluer white
þe helmes þei tohewen and toshrede
Out bresteþ þe blode with sterne stremes rede
Wiþ myȝty maces þe bones þei tobrest
And þorgh þe thikkest of þe throng gan threst
Þere stomblen stedes stronge and doun gon alle
He rolleþ vnder fote as doþ a balle
He foyneþ on his foote wiþ his tronchoun
And he hym hurteþ wiþ his hors adoun
He þorgh þe body is born and siþ is take
Maugre his hede and brouȝt vnto þe stake
As forward was  þer he most abide  
Anoþer lad is on þat oþere side
And somtyme doþ hem theseus forto rest
Hem to refresshe and drink ȝif hem lest
fful of a day han þise thybeanes two
Togidere mette and wrouȝt eche oþer woo
Vnhorsed haþ eche oþere of hem twey
Þer was no tigre in vale of Galgopleye
Whan hir whelpe is stole whan it is lite
So cruel on þe hunte as is Arcite
ffor Ielous hert vpon þis Palamon
Ne in Belmerie þer is so felle a lion
Þat hunted is or for his hunger wode
Ne of his pray desireþ so þe bloode
As Palamon to sclee his foo Arcite
þe Ielous strokes on her helmes bite
Out renneþ blood of boþ her sides rede
Somtyme an ende þer is on euery dede
ffor or þe sonne vnto þe reste went
Þe Stronge king Emetrius gan hent
This Palamon as he fauȝt wiþ Arcite
And made his swerde depe in his flesshe bite
And by  force of xxti is he take
Vnȝolden and drowen to þe stake


And in þe Rescowe of þis Palamon
The stronge king ligurge is born doun
And kinge Emetrius for al his grete strength
Is born out of his sadel his swerdes length
So hit hym Palamon er he were take
But al for nouȝt he was brouȝt to þe stake
His hardy herte may hym helpe nouȝt
He mote abide whan þat he is ykauȝt
By force and eke by composiciōn
Who soroweþ now but woful Palamon
They mote no more go ageyn to fiȝt
And whan þat he had sene þat siȝt
He cried Hoo no more for it is don  
Ne noon shal lenger to his felawe gon
I wil be trewe Iuge and not partie
Arcite of Thebes shal haue Emelye
That by his fortune haþ hir faire wonnen
Anon þer is a vois of puple bygonne
ffor Ioie of þis so loude and high wiþalle
It semed þat þe listes shulden falle
What can nowe faire Venus do aboue
What seiþ she now what doþ þis quene of loue
But wepeþ so for wanting of her wille
Til þat her teeres in þe listes fille
She seide I am ashamed doutelees
Saturnus seide doughter hold þi pees
Mars haþ his wil his knyght haþ al his bone
And by myne hede þou shalt be esed sone
The trompours wiþ þe loude mynstralsie
The harawdes þat ful loude ȝelle and crye
Bene in her wele for Ioie of daun arcyte
But harkeneþ me and stinte vois a lite
Swiche a myracle þer bifelle anōn
This ferce Arcite haþ of his helme ydon
And on a courcere forto shew his face
He prikkeþ endelonge þe large place


Loking vpward vnto Emelye
And she aȝein him cast a frendly ye
ffor wommen as to speken in comune
Thei folowen al þe fauour of fortune
And was al his  chere as in his herte
Out of þe grounde a fyre Infernal sterte
ffrom Pluto sent  at þe request of Saturne
ffor which his hors for fere gan to turne
And lepe aside and foundred as he lepe
And or þat Arcyte may taken kepe
He pight him on þe pomel of his heued
þat in þe place he laie as he were dede
His brest tobroste wiþ his sadel bowe  
As blak he lay as eny cole or crowe
So was þe blood yronne in his face
Anon he was brouȝt out of þe place
Wiþ herte sore vnto Theseus palays
Þo was he coruen out of his harnays
And in a bedde ybrouȝt ful faire and blyue
ffor he was ȝit in memorie and on lyue
And alway crying after emelie
Duke Theseus wiþ al his companye
Is commen home to Athenes Cite
With alle blisse and grete solempnite
Al be it þat þis auenture is falle
He wolde not discomforte hem alle
Men seide eke þat Arcide shuld not dye
He shal be heled of his maladye
And of anoþer þinge þei were as fayne
þat of hem alle þer nas no man slayne
Al were þei sore ybete and namely on
þat wiþ a spere was þrelled þe brest bon
Two oþer woundes and two broken armes
Somme had salue and some had charmes
ffermacies of erbes and eke saue
þei dronken for þei wold her lyues haue


ffor which þis noble duke as he wel can
Conforteþ and honoureþ euery man
And made Reuel al þe longe nyȝt
Vnto þe straunge lordes as it was riȝt
Ne þere was holde no discomforture
    
     
ffor fallinge is by an awenture
Ne to be lad by force vnto a stake
Vnȝolden and wiþ xxti knyȝtes take
A persone alon wiþ oute moo
And haried forþ by arme fote and too
And eke his stede dryven forþ with staues
With fote men boþ ȝemen and  knaues
It was aretted him no vilanye  
Þer may no man clepe it cowardye
ffor whiche anon duke Theseus lete crye
To stynten al rancour and  envie
Gree þei as wel of on side as of oþer
And eiþer side ylike as oþeres broþer
And ȝaf hem ȝiftes after her degre
And fulli heelde a feeste daies þree
And conueyed þe kingges worþely
Out of his toune a Iourne largely
And home went euery man þe riȝt way
Þer was no more but fare wel and haue good day
 Of þis bataille I wil no more endite
But speke of Palamon and of Arcyte
Swelleþ þe brest of Arcyte and þe sore
Encreseþ at his herte more and more
The clotered blood for eny leche craft
Corrumpeþ and is in his body laft
Þat neiþer veyn blood ne ventowsinge
Ne drinke of herbes may be  helpinge
By vertue expulsif or anymall
ffro þilk vertu cleped naturall


Ne may þe venyme voide ne expelle
The pipes of his longges gan to swell
And euery lacert in his hert adoun
Is shent wiþ venyme and corrupcioun
Hym Geyneþ neiþer forto gete his lif
Vomyte vpward ne dounward laxatif
Al is tobrosten thilk regiōn
Nature haþ no dominaciōn
And certeinly þer nature wil not wirche
ffarewel Phisik go bere þe man to chirche
This is all and some þat Arcita most die
ffor which he sendeþ after Emelie
And Palamon his cosyne dere
þan seide he þus as ȝe shal after here
Not may my woful spirite in myn hert  
Declare a poynt of my sorowes smert
To ȝou my lady þat I loue moste
But I biqueth þe seruise of my gooste
To ȝou abouen euery creature
Siþ þat my lif may no lenger dure
Allas þe woo allas þe peynes stronge
þat I for ȝou haue suffred and so longe
Alas þe deþe alas myn Emelie
Alas departinge of our companye
Alas my hertes quene alas my lief wif
Myn hertes lady endere of my lif
What is þe world what axen men to haue
Now wiþ his loue nowe in his cold graue
Allone wiþ oute eny companye
ffare wel my foo fare wel myn Emely
And softe take me in ȝoure  twey
ffor loue of god herkeneþ what I seie
I haue here wiþ my Cosyn Palamon
Had strif and rancoure mony day agon
ffor loue of ȝou and for my Ielousie
And Iubiter so wis my soule gye


To speken of a seruaunt proprely
Wiþ circumstaunces al trewly
Þat is to seyn trouth honure and knyȝthede
Wisdom humblesse estat and high kynrede
ffredom and al þat longeþ to þat art
So Iubiter haue on my soule part
As in þis worlde riȝt now know I none
So worþi to be biloued as Palamon
Þat serueþ ȝou and wil do al his liff
And if þat ȝe shal euer bene a wif
fforȝete not Palamon þe gentile man
And wiþ þat worde his speche faile bygan
ffor from his fete vnto þe hert was come
þe colde of deþ þat had him ouercome
And ȝit more ouer for in his armes twoo  
þe vtal strength is lost and al ago
Only þe intellecte wiþ oute more
þat dwelled in his herte sik and sore
Gan failen whan þe herte felte deth
Dusken his eyen two and faileþ breþe
But on his lady ȝit cast he his ye
His laste word was mercy Emelye
His spirit chaunged hens and went þere
As I cam neuere I can not telle where
Therfor I stint I am no dyvynystre
Of soules fynde I not in þis registere
Ne me ne list þilk opynyons to telle
Of hem þouȝe þat þei writen wher þei dwelle
Arcite is colde þat mars his soule gye
Now wil I speken forþ of emely
Shrite Emely an halowen Palamon
And Theseus his suster toke anōn
Swownyng and bar hir fro his cours away
What helpeþ it vs to tarien forþ þe day
To tellen howe she wepte boþ euen and morowe
ffor in suche caas wommen han suche sorowe


Whan þat her husbondes bene fro hem agoo
 ffor þe more parte þei sorowen soo
Or ellis fallen in such Maladie

Infinite harmes bene and eke þe teeres
Of olde folk and folk of tendere ȝeres
In all þe toun for deth of þis Thebean
ffor him þer wepen boþ child and man
So grete weping was þer  certayn
Whan Ector was brouȝt and fressh ysclayn
To Troy allas þe pite þat was þere
Cracching of chekes renting eke of here
Whi woldest þou be dede þise wommen crie
And haddest gold ynoghe and emelye
No man myght glade Theseus  
Sauyng his olde fadere Egeus
That knewe þis worldes transmutacioun
As he had sene it vp and doūn
Ioie after woo and woo aftere gladnesse
And sheweþ hem ensample and liknesse
Riȝt as þer dyed neuer man quod he

Riȝt so ther lyued neuere man he seide
In al þis world þat somtyme he ne deyed
þis world is nouȝt but a þorght fare ful of woo
And we bene pilgrymes passing to and froo
Deþ is an ende of euery worldly sore
And ouer al þis ȝit seide he mychel more
To þis effecte ful wisely to enhorte

Duke Theseus wiþ al his bisy Cure
Tasteþ nowe where þat þe sepulture
Of good Arcite may best ymaked be
And eke most honurable of degre
And atte last he toke conclusion
That þer as first Arcite and Palamon


Had for loue þe bataile hem bitwene
þat in þe self groue swete and grene
þer as he had his Amerous desires
His compleynt and for loue his hote fires
He wold make a fire in which þe office
ffuneral he myȝt hem all complice
He lete anon comaunde to hakke and hewe
þe okes olde and leye hem on a rewe
In colpons wel araied forto brenne
His Officers with swift fote thei renne
And riȝt anon at his comaundement
And aftere Theseus haþ ysent
Aftere a beer and it al ouer spradde
Wiþ cloþ of gold the ricchest þat he hadde
And of þe same sute he cloþer Arcite  
Vpon his hondes  his gloues white
Eke on his hede a croune of laurere grene
And in his hand a swerde ful briȝt and kene
He laide him bare þe visage vnto þe bere
Ther wiþ he wepte þat pite was to here
And for þe puple shulde sene hym all
Whan it was daie he brouȝt hym to þe hall
þat roreþ of þe crie and of þe sorowe sone
þoo gan þis woful Thebean Palamon
Wiþ flotery berd and ruggy asshy heres
In cloþes blake dropped al wiþ teeres
And passing oþer of weping Emelie
She rewfullest of al þe companye
In as moche as þe seruyse shuld be
þe more noble and riche in his degre
Duke Theseus lete forþ þe stedes bringe
That trapped were in steel al gliteringe
And keuered wiþ þe armes of Dame Arcite
Vppon þise stedes grete and white
Ther stoden folk of which oon bare his sheelde
Anoþer his spere vpon his hondes helde


The iij bare wiþ him bowe turkeys
Of brent gold was þe caas and eke þe harneys
And riden forþ a paas wiþ sory chere
Towardes þe groue as ȝe shul after here
The noblest of þe Grekes þat þer were
Vpon her shulders cariden þe berc
Wiþ sclak paas and yen rede and wete
þorgh out þe Cite by þe maister strete
þat sprad was al wiþ blak and wonder hye
Riȝt of þe same is þe strete ywrie
Vpon þe Riȝt honde went olde Egeus
And on þat oþer side Duke Theseus
Wiþ vesselles in her hondes of gold ful fyne
Al ful of hony mylk  blood and wyne
Eke Palamon with ful grete companye  
And aftere þat come wooful Emelie
Wiþ fire in hand as was þat time þe Gyse
To do þe office of funeral seruise
High labour  and ful grete apparaillinge
Was at þe seruyse and at þe fire makinge
That wiþ his grene top þe heuene raught
And xxti fadmes in brede þe armes raught
This is to seine þe bowes were so brode
Of strawe first þer was leide mony a lode
But howe þe fire was maked vp hiȝt
Ne eke þe names howe þe trees hiȝt
As Oke fir birch asp alder Elme popelere
Wilowe holme playn assh box Chesteyn bynd laure
Mapel þorne becche ewe hasell wypultre
How þei were felled shal not be tolde for me
Ne howe þe goddes ronnen vp and doun
Disherites of her habitacioun
In whiche þei wonden in rest and pees
Nymphes ffawnes and amadries
Ne howe þe beestes ne þe briddes alle
ffledden for fere whan þei were falle


Ne howe þe grounde agast was of þe liȝt
That was not wonte to se þe sonne briȝt
Ne how þe fire was couched first wiþ stre
And þan wiþ drie stikkes clouen a þree
And þan wiþ grene wode and spicerie
And þan wiþ cloþe of gold and  perrie
And Garlondes honging wiþ mony a floure
The myrr þensence with swete odoure
Ne how arcite lay among al þis
Ne what richesse aboute his body is
Ne howe Emely as was þe Gise
Put in þe fire of funeral seruise
Ne howe she swowned whan made was þe fire
Ne what she spak ne what was her desire
Ne what Ielous men in þe fire cast  
Whan þat þe fire was grete and brente fast
Nowe howe some cast her sheelde and some her spere
And of her vestementes which þei were
And Coppes ful of mylke and wyne and blood
Into þe fire þat brent as it were wode
Ne howe þe greges wiþ an huge route
Thrise riden al þe fire aboute
Vpon þe lift honde wiþ a loude shoutinge
And thries wiþ her speres clateringe
And thries how þe ladise gan crie
Ne howe þat lad was homward Emely
Ne how arcyte is brent in asshen colde
Ne how þe lichewake was holde
Al þat nyght ne howe þe Grekes pleye
The wakeplaies kepe I not to seie
Who wrasteleþ best naked with oile anoynt
Ne who  bare him best in no dysioynt
I wil not tellen all howe þei  gone
Home til Athenes whan þe play is done
But shortely to þe point þan wil I wende
And make of my longe tale an ende


By processe and by length of ȝeres
Al stinte is þe mournyng and þe teeres
Of Greges by oon general assent
Than semed me þer was a parlement
At Athenes vpon a certeyn point and caas
And amonge pointes  yspoken waas
To haue wiþ certeyn contrees alliance
And haue of Thebeanes fully obeisance
ffor which this noble theseus anōn
Lete sende after gentile Palamon
Vnwist of him what was þe cause and whi
But in his blake cloþes sorowfully
He come at his comaundement in hie
Tho sente Theseus for Emelye
Whan þat þei were sette and huyst was al þe place  
And Theseus abiden haþ þe space
Or eny worde come fro his wise brest
His yen sette he þer hym lest
And such a sad visage he sighed stille
And after þat riȝt þus he seide his wille
The firste mouer of þe cause aboue
Whan he first made þe faire cheyn of loue
Gret was þe effecte and high was his entent
Wel wist he why and what þerof he ment
ffor wiþ þat faire cheyne of loue he bonde
The fuyre þe Eire þe water and þe londe
In certeyn boondes þat þei may not flee
That same prince and þat same mouer quod he
Haþ stablesshed in þis wrecched world adoun
Certeyn days and Dominacioun
To al þat is engendred in þis place
Ouer þe whiche day þei may not pace
Al mowe þei ȝit þe daies abregge
Ther nys noon autorite to legge
ffor it is proued by experience
But that me lust declare my sentence


Than may men by þis order discerne
That þilk mouer stable is and eterne
Wel may men knowe but it be a fool
That euery part darrayueth fro his hool
ffor nature haþ not taken his bygynnyng
Of no partie or of catel of no þing
But oon þinge þat parfit is and stable
Descendinge so til it be corruptable
And þerfore of his wise purueaunce
He haþ so wel bysette his ordynaunce
Þat specifie of þingges and progressiones
Shullen endure by successiones
And not eterne wiþ oute eny lye
This maist þou vnderstond and see atte ye
Lo the Oke þat hath so longe a norshinge  
ffro þe tyme þat it bygynneþ furst to springe
And haþ so longe a lif as ȝe may se
Ȝit at þe laste waasted is þe tree
Considereþ eke howe þat þe herde stone
Vnder our fete on which we treden and gone
Ȝit ȝ wasteþ it as it lith in þe way
þe Brode Ryuer somtyme wexeþ dray
þe grete townes so wide wane and wende
Than þe see þat al þis þing haþ ende
And man and womman so we wil also
That nedeþ in oon of þe teermes twoo
þat is to sayn in youþe or ellis in age
He mote be dede þe kinge as wel as page
Some in his bed some in þe depe see
Some in þe large felde as ȝe may see
Ther helpeþ nouȝt al goþ þat ilk waye
þan may I seie þat al þis þing wil deye
What makeþ þis but Iubiter þe king
þat is prince and cause of al þing
Couerting al vnto his propre wille
ffrom which it is darreyude soþ to telle


Aud here agayne no creature on lyue
Of no degre availleþ forto stryue
Than is it wisdome as þenkeþ me
To make vertue of necessite
And take it wel þat we may not eschew
And namely þat  þat to vs all is dwe
And who so gruccheþ ouȝt he doþ foly
And rebell is to him þat al may gye
And certeynly a man haþ most honour
To dyen in his excellence and flour
Whan he is siker of his good name
þan haþ he done his frende ne hym no shame
And gladder auȝt  his frende  ben of his deth
Whan wiþ honour yȝolden is vp þe breeth
Than whan his name appalled is for age  
ffor al forȝeten is his vassalage
Than is þe best as for a worþi fame
To dyen whan he is best of name
The Contrarie of al þis is wilfulnesse
Why grucche we whi haue we heuynesse
That goode Arcite of Chyualre þe flour
Departed is wiþ dwete and wiþ honour
Out of þe foule prison of þis liff
Whi grucchen here his cosyn and his wiff
Of his welfare þat loueþ hem so wel
Can he hem þonk nay god wote neuer a dell
That boþ his soule and eke hem  offende
And ȝit þei mowe not hir lustes amende
What may conclude of þis longe serie
But after woo I rede vs be merie
And þanken Iubiter of al his grace
And or we departen from þis place
I rede we made of sorowes twoo
Oo parfite Ioie lasting euermoo
And loke nowe wher most sorowe is her Inne
þer at wil I furst bygynne


Suster quod he þis is my ful assent
Wiþ all thaues here of my parlement
That Gentile Palamon ȝour owne knygȝt
þat serueþ ȝou wiþ wille herte and myȝt
And euer haþ do siþen ȝe first hym knewe
þat ȝe shal of ȝoure grace vpon hym rewe
And taken  for husbonde and for lord
Lene me ȝoure honde for þis is our accord
Lete se nowe of ȝoure womanly pite
He is a kingges broþer sone parde
And þouȝe he be a poor bachiler
Siþ he haþ serued ȝou so mony a ȝere
And had for ȝou so grete aduersite
It most be considered leueþ me
ffor gentel Mercy ouȝt to passen riȝt  
Than seide he þus to Palamon þe knyȝt
I trowe þere nede litel sermonynge
To make ȝou assente to þis þinge
Commeþ nere and takeþ ȝoure lady by þe honde
Bytwix hem two was made anon þe bonde
þat hiȝte Matrimoyne or mariage
By all þe counsaile and  baronage
And þus wiþ al blisse and melodye
Haþ Palamon ywedded Emelye
And god þat al þis world haþ wrouȝt
Send hym his loue þat haþ it dere bouȝt
ffor nowe is Palamon in al wele
Lyuynge in al blisse in ricches and in hele
And Emely him loueþ so tenderly
And he hir serueþ so gentely
Was neuer no worde hem bitwene
Of Ielousie or eny oþer tene
Thus endeþ þe tale of Palamon and Emelye
And god saue al þis faire companye
Whan þat þe knyght had þus his tale told
In al the companye nas þer ȝonge ne olde
Þat he ne seide it was a noble storie
And worþi to be drawe in memorie
And namely the gentels euerechon
Our hooste loughe and swore so mot I gon
This goþ a riȝt vnbokeled is þe male
Lat se nowe who shal telle anoþere tale
ffor trewly þe game is wel bygonne
Now telleþ ȝe sir monke ȝif ȝe conne
Somwhat to quyte wiþ þe knyghtes tale
The Miller þat fordronke was al pale
So þat vnneþes vppon his hors he satte
He wold availe neiþe hode ne hatte
Ne abide no man for his curtesie  
But in Pilates vois he bygan to crie
And swore by armes blode and bones
I can a noble tale for þe nones
Wiþ þe which I wil now quyte þe knyȝtes tale
Our  seghe þat he was dronke of ale
And seide abide Robyn leue brother
Somme better man shal telle vs first anoþer
Abide and  us wirche thriftely
By goddes soule quod he þat wil not I
ffor I wil speke or ellis go my way
Our hooste answerd seye on a deuel way
Thou arte a fool þi witt is ouercommen
Now harkeneþ quod þe myllere al and som
 But first I make a protestacioun
þat I am dronke I knowe it by my soun
And þerfore ȝif I mysspeke or say
Wite it þe Ale of suthwerk I ȝou pray


ffor I will telle a legend and a liff
Boþ of a Carpenter and  his wiff
How þat a clerke reft the wriȝtes cappe
The reue answerd and seide stint of þi clappe
Lat be þi lewde dronken harlotrie
It is a synne and eke a grete folye
To appeyren eny man or hym diffame
And eke to bringe wives in such name
Þow maist ynowe of oþer þingges seine
Þis dronken Millere spake ful sone ageyn
And seide leue broþer oswalde
Who haþ no wif is no kukwold
But I seie not þerfor þat þou art oon
Ther ben ful good wyues mony on
     
     
Whi art þou angry wiþ my tale nowe
I haue a wiff parde as wel as þou
Ȝit nolde I for þe oxen in my plogh
Take vpon me more þan ynogh
As demen of my seluen þat I were oone  
I wil bylieue þat þat I am none
An husbond shuld not be inquesitif
Of goddes priuete ne of his wif
So he may finde goddes foyson þere
Of þe remenant nedeþ nat to enquere
What shuld I more seie but þe Millere
He nyl his wordes for no man forbere
But tolde his Chirles tale in his manere
Me forþenkeþ þat I shal reherce it here
And þerfore euery gentil wiȝt I preie
Demeþ not for goddes loue þat I seie
Of euel entent but for I mote reherce
Her tales alle be þei better or wors
Or ellis fals somen of my matere
And þerfore who list it not here


Torne ouer þe lief and chese anoþer tale
ffor ȝe shul fynde ynow grete and smale
Of historial þinge þat toucheþ gentilnesse
And eke moralite and holynesse
Blame not me ȝif þat ye chese amys
The Millere is a cheerle ȝe knowe wel þis
So was the Reue eke and other moo
And harlotrie þei told boþ twoo
Avise ȝou and put me out of blame
And eke men shal not make ernest of game
Whilom þer was dwelling in Oxenford
A riche gnof þat gestes helde to bord
And of his craft he was a Carpenter
Wiþ him þer was dwelling a pore scolere
Had lerned arte but al his fantasie
Was turned forto lere Astrologie
And cowde a certeyn of conclusions
To demen by interrogacions
Ȝif þat men axed him incerteyn houres  
Whan þat men shuld haue drouȝte of shoures
Or ȝif men axed him what shuld byfalle
Of euery þing I may not rekne alle
This tale was cleped hende Nicholas
Of derne loue and priue solas
And þerto he was sclegh and ful priue
And liche to a maiden meke to see
A chambre had he in þat ostelrie
Allone wiþout eny companye
fful fetist dight wiþ herbes swote
And he hym self as swete as is þe rote
Of licorace or ony sytuale
His almagist and bokes grete and smale
His asterlaboure longinge for his arte
His awgryme stones layen ful faire aparte
On shelues couched at his beddes heuede
His presse ykeuered wiþ a falding rede
And al aboue þer lay a gay sautrie
On which he made on nyghtes melodye
So swetely þat al þe chambre ronge
And angelus ad virginem he songe
And after þat he songe þe kingges note
fful ofte blessed was his mery þrote


And þus þe swete Clerk his tyme spente
Aftere his frendes fynding and his rente
This Carpentere had wedded newe a wiff
Which þat he loued more þan his liff
Of xviij ȝere she was of age
Ielous he was and kept hir streit in cage
ffor she was wily and yonge and he was olde
And demed hym self to be like a Cukwolde
He knewe not Caton for his wit is rude
Þat bad man shuld wedde his similitude
Men shul wedde aftere her estate
ffor ȝouþe and elde is oft at debate
But sith he was fallen in þe snare  
He most enduren as oþer folk his care
ffair was þis yonge wif and þer wiþ all
As eny wesell her body gent and small
A seynt she wered barred al of silk
A barmecloþe as white as morn mylk
Vpon her lendes ful of mony a gore
White was hir smok and enbrauded al byfore
And eke behinde on her coler aboute
Of Coleblak silk withInne and eke wiþoute
The tapes of hir white volipere
Were of þe same sute of hir colere
Hir Philett brode of silk and sette ful hie
And sikerly she had a lykerous ye
fful smal ypulled were her browes twoo
And þoo were bent and blake as eny sloo
She was more blisful on to se
þan is þe newe Perient tree
And softer þan þe woll is of eiþer
And by hir girdel henge a purs of leder
Tasshed wiþ silk and perled with latoun
In al þis worlde to seke vp and doun
Ther nys no man so wise þat couþe þenche
So gay a popelot or  a wenche


fful briȝt was the shynyng of her hwe
Than in þe toure þe noble forged newe
But of her songe it was as loude and ȝerne
As eny swalowe sittinge on a beerne
Þerto she couþe skippe and make a game
As eny kid or calf folowing his dame
Her mouþe was swete as braket or meth
Or horde of apples leide in hay or heth
Wynsinge she was as is a Ioly colt
Longe as a mast and vpward as a bolt
A broche she bare on her loue coler
As brode as is þe boos of a bokelere
Her shoes were laised on her legges hie  
She was a Primeroll a Pigges nye
ffor eny lorde to liggen in his bedde
Or ȝit for eny  ȝeman to wedde
Now sir and eft sir and so bifelle þe caas
That on a day þis heende Nicholas 
ffelle wiþ þis yonge wif forto rage and play
While þat her husbonde was at osenay
As clerkes bene ful subtile and ful queynte
And prively he kauȝt hur by þe queynte
And seide ywis but I haue my wille
ffor deerne loue of þe lemman I spille
And helde hure fast by þe haunche bonys
And seide lemman my will at onys
Or I wil die as god me saue
And she spronge as a colt in traue
And wiþ her hede sche wried fast away
She saide I wil not kisse þe by my fay
Wy labbe quod she latt be Nicholas
Or I wil crie out harowe and alas
Do way ȝoure hondes for ȝour curtesie
This Nicholas gan mercy forto crie
And spake so faire and profred him ful fast
þat she her loue graunted hym atte last


And swoor hir ooþe by seint Thamas of kent
That she wolde bene at his comaundement
Whan þat she may hir laizere wel aspie
Myn husbonde is so ful of Ielousie
Þat but ȝe waite wele and by prive
I woote riȝt wel I ne am but dede quod she
Ȝe mote be ful deerne as in þis caas
Nay þerof care ȝou not quod Nicholaas
A Clerk has liþerly bysette his while
But ȝif he couþe a carpenter begile
And þus þei acorded and sworne
To awaite a tyme as I haue seide biforn
Whan Nicholas had don þus euery dele  
And twakked her aboute þe lendes welle
He kisseþ her swete and takeþ his sautrie
And pleieþ fast and makeþ melodye
þan fille it þus þat to þe parissh chirche
Cristes werkes for to wirche
This good wif went vpon an halyday
Hir forhede shoon as briȝt as eny day
So was it wasshe whan she left her werk
Now was þere of þe chirch a parissh clerk
Þe which was cleped absalon
Crulle was his heer and as þe golde shone
And strouted as  fanne large and brode
fful streite and euene laie his Ioly shode
His rudde was rede his eyen grey as goos
Wiþ Powles wyndowes corven in his shoos
In hosen rede he wente fetisly
Iclad he was ful smal and proprely
Al in a kirtel of light wagett
fful faire and þikke ben þe poyntes sette
And þervpon he had  gay surplise
As white as is þe blossom on  rise
A mery child he was so god me saue
Wel coude he late blood  clippe and shaue


And make a chartere of londe or a quytaunce
In xxti maners coude he trippe and daunce
After the scole of Oxenforde þoo
And wiþ his legges casten to and froo
And pleyen songes on a small rybibe
Some he songe a loude quynybe
As as wel coude he pley on a gytern
In al þe towne nas brewhous ne taucrn
Þat he ne viset wiþ his solas
þer eny gailerd tapster was
But soth to sayn he was somdele squeymous
Of fartinge and of speche daungerous
This Absolon þat was Ioly and gay  
Goþ wiþ a sensure on þe sonday
Sensinge þe wyues of þe parissh fast
And mony a louely loke on hem he cast
And namely on þe Carpenters wiff
To loke on hyr him þouȝt a mery liff
She was so propre swete and likerous
I dar wel say and she had be a mous
And he a Catt he wold hire hent anōn
This parissh clerk þis Ioly absolon
Haþ in his herte such a loue longynge
That of no wiff toke he non offringe
For curtesie he seide he wolde none
The mone whan it was nyȝt briȝt shone
And absolon his gitern haþ take
For paramours he þouȝte forto wake
And forþe he goþ Ielous and amerous
Til he come to þe Carpenters hous
A litel aftere þe Cok had ycrowe
And dressed hym vnder a shette wyndowe
That was vpon þe Carpenters walle
He singeþ in his vois gentile and smalle
Now dere lady ȝif þi wil be
I prei ȝou þat ȝe wil rewe on me


Ful wel according to his giternynge
This Carpentere awoke and herd hym singe
And spake vnto his wif and seide anon
What alison herest þou not Absolon
Þat chaunteþ þus vndere our boures wall
And she answerd her husbond þer wiþ all
Ȝis god wote Iohn I here it euery dele
þis passeþ forþ what wil ȝe than but wele
ffro day to day þis Ioly absolon
So woweþ hire þat hym was woobygon
He wakeþ al þe nyȝt and al þe day
He kembeþ his lockes brode and made hem gay
He woweþ hir by menes and brocage  
And swoor he wolde bene her wne page
He Syngeþ brokking as a nyghtyngale
He sent her pyment Methe and spised ale
And wafres pyping hote out of þe glede
And to hir often he profered mede
ffor some wil be wonnen for ricches
And some for strokes and some for gentilnesse
Somtyme to shewe his lightnesse and maisstrie
He pleieth herawdes vpon a scaffold hie
But what availleþ him as in þis caas
So loueth she þis hende Nicholaas
That Absolon may blawe þe buke horn
He ne had for his labour but a scorn
And þus she makeþ absolon her Ape
Al his eernest turneþ but to a Iape
ffor soþe þis prouerbe it is no lye
Men seien þus alway þe nyȝte sclie
Makeþ þe feer loue to be loth
ffor þouȝe þat absolon be wode or wroth
By cause þat he fer was from her siȝt
This Niȝte Nicholas stode in his liȝt
Nowe bere ȝou wel thou hende Nicholas
ffor absolon may waille and singe allas


And so byfelle it on a Saterday
This Carpentere was gone to Osnay
And hende Nicholas and Alison
Accorded were to þis conclusion
Þat Nicholas shal shapen hym a wile
This sely Ielous husbonde to begile
And if so be þe game went a riȝt
She shulde sclepe in his arme al þat nyȝt
For þis  his desire and hers also
And riȝt anon wiþoute wordes moo
This Nicholas no lenger wold tarie
But doþ ful softe into his chamber carie
Both mete and drinke for a daye or tweye  
And to hir husbonde bad hir for to seie
If þat he asked after Nicholas
She shulde seie she nyst not wher he was
Of al þat day she see hym not wiþ ye
She trowed þat he was in maladye
ffor no crie her maide can calle
He nolde answere for nouȝt that may bifalle
This passeþ forþ al þe Saterday
That Nicholas stille in his bed lay
And ete and slepte and  what hym lest
Til sonday þat þe sonne goþ to rest
This sely Carpenter haþ grete mervaile
Of Nicholas or what þing myȝt hym aile
And saide I am adrad by seynt Thomas
It stondeth not ariȝt wiþ Nicholas
God shilde þat he deyed sodenily
This world is nowe ful tikil sikerly
I seghe today a coors born to chirche
That now on monday I segh fast wirche
Go vp quod he to his knaue anon
Clepe at his door or knokke wiþ a ston
Loke howe it is and telle me boldely
þis knaue went him vp ful sturdely


And at the Chamber door while þat he stode
He cried an knokked as he were wode
What howe what do ȝe maister Nicholay
Howe may ȝe sclopen al þis longe day
But al for nouȝt he herd neuer a word
An hoole he foonde ful lowe vnder a bord
Ther as þe Catt was wonte forto crepe
And at þe hole he loked in ful depe
And atte last he had of him a siȝt
þis Nicholas satte euere gaping vp riȝt
As he had kiked on þe newe moone
And doune he goþ and told his maister sone
In what araie he segh þat ilke man  
This carpentere to blissen hym bygan
And seide helpe vs seint ffredeswyde
A man wote litel what shal hym betide
This man is fallen wiþ his astronomye
In some woodnesse or in some Agonye
I þouȝt wel howe it shuld be
Men shuld not knowe of goddis privete
Ȝe blessed be alway þe lewde man
þat nouȝt but only his bileeue can
So ferde anoþer clerk with astronomye
He walked into þe feeldes for to prie
Vpon þe sterres to wit what shal byfalle
Til he was in a Marle pitte yfalle
He seighe noȝt but yit by seint Thomas
Me rueþ soor hende Nicholas
He schal be rated of his stodying
If þat I may by Ihesu heuene knyge
Gete me a staf þat I may vnderspore
While þat þou Robyn heuest vp þe dore
He shal out of his stodying as I gesse
And to þe Chamber dore he gan hym dresse
His knaue was a stronge Carle for þe nones
And by þe haspe he haue it vp at ones


Into þe floor þe door fille anon
This Nicholas sat ay stille as ston
And euere gaped vpward into þe eire
þis carpenter wende he were in despeir
And hent hym by þe shuldres myȝtely
And shoke him hard and cried spitously
What Nicholay what loke adoun
Awake and þenk on cristes passioun
I crouche þe from eveles and fro wiȝtes
þerwith þe nyȝt spelle he seide anon riȝtes
On four halues of the hous aboute
And on þe thresshhold on þe dore withoute
Ihesu crist and seynt Benedight  
Blesse þis hous from euery wicked wight
ffor þe nyghtes verye þe white pater noster
Where wentestowe  seynt Peters suster
And atte last þis hende Nicholas
Gan for to sighe sore and seide allas
Shal al þe world be loste eftsones nowe
This Carpentere answerde what seist þowe
What þenk on god as we don þat swynk
This Nicholas answerde focche me drink
And aftere I wil speke in privete
Of certeyn þing þat towcheþ þe and me
I wille telle it noon oþer man cereteyne
This carpenter goþ doun and commeþ ageyne
And brouȝt of myghty ale a large quarte
And whan þat eche of hem had dronke his parte
þis Nicholas his door fast shette
And doun þe Carpenter by hym he sette
And seide Iohn myn hooste lief and dere
Þow shalt vpon þi trouþ swere me heere
That to no wight þou shalt þis counsell wrey
ffor it is cristes counsaile þat I sey
And if þu telle it man þou art forlore
ffor þis vengeannce þou shalt haue þerfore


þat if þow wrey me þou shalt be wode
 Nay crist forbede it for his holy blood
Quod þoo þis sely man I ne am no labbe
Ne þough I seie it I ne am not lief to gabbe
Sey what þowe wolt I shal it neuer telle
To Childe ne wif by hym þat harowed helle
Nowe Iohn quod Nicholas I wil not lie
I haue yfounden in myn astrologie
As I haue loked in þe mone briȝt
þat nowe on monday next a quarter nyȝt
Shal falle a rayn and þat so wild and wode
þat half so grete was never noes flode
This world he saide in lasse þan in an houre  
Shal al be dreint so hidous is þe showre
Thus shal mankinde drenche and lese her liff
This Carpentere answerd allas my wiff
And shal she drenche allas myn alisoun
ffor sorowe of þis he fille almost adoun
And seide is no remedye in þis caas
Wy ȝis for god quod heende Nicholas
If þow wolte worchen aftere lore and rede
Þowe maist not worchen after þine owne hede
ffor þus seith salomon þat was ful trewe
Worche al by counsaile and þou shalt not rewe
And if þou worchen wolt by good counsaille
I vndertake wiþouten mast or saille
Ȝit shal I saue hir and þe and mee
Hast þou not herd how saued was Noe
Whan þat our lorde haþ warned hym byforn
Þat al the world wiþ water shuld be lorn
Ȝis quod þis Carpenter ful ȝore agoo
Hastowe not herde quod Nicholas also
þe sorowe of Noe wiþ his felawship
Or he myȝt gete his wif to ship
Hym had leuere I dar wel vndertake
At þilke tyme þan all his weþeres blake


þat she had a ship hure self allōn
And þerfor woostowe what is best to don
Thix axeth hast and of an hastif þinge
Men may not preche or make taryinge
Anoon go gete vs fast into þis Inne
A knedinge trough or ellis a kemelyne
ffor eche of vs but loke þat þei bene large
In whiche men mowe swymme as in a barge
And han her vitailles suffisaunt
But for a day fye on þe remenaunt
þe water shal aslake and gon away
Aboute pryme vpon þe nexte day
But Robyne may not wit of þis þi knaue  
Ne eke þi maide Gill I may not saue
Axe not why for þouȝe þou axe me
I wil not tellen goddes priuete
It suffiseþ þe but if þi wittes madde
To haue as grete a grace as Noe hadde
þi wif shal I wel saue out of doute
Go nowe þi way and spede þe here aboute
But whan þou hast for hir and þe and me
ygeten vs þise kneding treies þre
Þan shalt þou honge hem in þe roof ful hie
Þat no man of oure purueaunce espie
And whan þou þus hast don as I haue seide
And hast oure vitaile faire in hem yleide
And eke an axe to smyte þe cord a two
Whan þat þe water commeþ þat we may goo
And broke and hole on high vpon the gable
Vnto þe gardyne ward ouer þe stable
þat we may frely passen forþ our waye
Whan þat þe grete shoure is passed awaye
Than shalt þou swymme as mery I vndertake
As doþ þe wight duk aftere þe drake
þan wol I clepe how alison howe Iohn
Be mery for þe flood wil passe anōn


And þowe wilt seyn heil Maister Nicholay
Good morowe I see þe wele for it is day
And þan shal we be lordes al oure lif
Of alle þe world as Noe and his wif
But þat of oo þing I warne þe ful riȝt
Be wel avised on þat ilk nyȝt
Þat we bene entred into þe shippes boord
Þat noon of vs ne speke not a word
Ne Clepe ne crie but bene in his preire
ffor it is goddis owe heeste dere
Thi wif and þou mote honge fer atwynne
ffor þat bitwix ȝou shal be no synne
No more in loking þan þer shal in dede  
Þis ordinaunce is seide so god þe spede
To morowe at nyght whan men bene all aslepe
Into our kneding trowes wil we crepe
And sitten þer abidinge goddis grace
Go nowe þi way I haue no lenger space
To make of þis no lenger sermonyng
Men seyn þus sende þe wise and say no þinge
þou art so wise it nededeþ þe not teche
Go saue our lif and þat I þe biseche
 This sely Carpentere goþ forþ his way
fful oft he seide alas and wayleway
And to his wif he tolde his priuete
And she was war and knewe it bet þan he
What al þis queinte cast was for to saye
But nathelees she feerde as she wold deye
And saide alas go foorþ þi way anon
Helpe vs to scape or we bene dede echon
I am þi trewe verry wedded wiff
Go dere spouse and helpe to saue our lif
Lo swich a grete þing is affectiōn
Men may dye for ymaginaciōn
So depe may impression be take
This sely Carpenter bygynneþ quake


Hym þenkeþ verrely þat he may se
Noe flood come walking as þe See
To drenchen alison his hony dere
He wepeth weilleth and maketh sori chere
He sigheþ wiþ mony a sory swough
And gooþ and geteþ hym a knedinge trough
And aftere a Tubbe and a kemelyne
And prively he sent hem to his Inne
And henge hem in þe roof in privete
His owne honde he made eke ledders þre
To clymben by þe ronges and þe stalkes
Vnto þe tubbes hongyng in þe balkes
And hem vitailled boþ trouȝe and tubbe  
Wiþ brede wiþ chese wiþh good ale in a Iubbe
Suffisinge riȝt ynowe as for a day
But er he had made al þis aray
He sent his knaue and eke his wenche alsoo
Vpon his nede to London for to goo
 And on þe Monday whan it drouȝe to nyȝt
He shette his door wiþouten candel liȝt
And dressed al þing as it shuld be
And shortely clumben vp al þre
Þei seiten stille wel a forlonge way
Now Pater noster Clum seide Nicholay
And Clum quod Iohn and clum seide Alison
This Carpentere seide his devociōn
And stille he sitte and biddeþ his preier
Awaitinge on þe reyne if he it here

Aboute Curfewe tyme or litel more

But ofte he routed for his hede myslay
Doun of þe ledder stalkeþ Nicholay
And Alison ful softe adoune she spedde
Wiþouten wordes moo þei gon to bedde


Þer as þe Carpenter is wonte to lye
Þer was þe reuel and þe melodye
And þus lith alison and Nicholas
In busynes of myrth and of solas
Til þat þe belle of laudes gan to rynge
And freres in þe chaunsel gan to singe
 This Parissh clerk þis amorous absolon
Þat is for loue alway so woo bygon
Vpon þe Monday was at Oseney
Wiþ Company him to disport and pley
And axed vpon a caas a Cloystrere
fful prively after Iohn þe Carpentere
And he drowe hym apart out of þe chirch  
And seide I note I seghe hym here not wirch
Siþ saterday I trowe þat he be went
ffor tymbre þer oure abbot haþ hym sent
ffor he is wonte for tymbre forto goo

Or ellis he is at his hous certeyn
Wher þat he be I can not soþly seyn
This absolon ful Ioly was and liȝt
And þought now is tyme to wake al nyght
ffor sikerly I segh hym not stirenge
Abouten his door siþ day bygan to springe
So mote I thrive I shal atte Cockes crowe

Þat stant ful lowe vpon his bowres walle
To Alison now wil I tellen alle
My loue longyng for þat I shal not mysse

Som manere comfort shal I haue parfay
My mouþe haþ icched al þis longe day
þat is a signe of kissing atte leest
Al nyght me met eek I was at a fest
þerfor I wil goo sclepe an hour or twey
And al þe nyght þan wil I wake and pley


Whan þat þe firste cok haþ crowe anon
Vp stert þis Ioly louer absolon
And hym araied gay and poynt devise
But first he sheweþ greyn and licorise
To smellen swote er he had kempt his here
Vndere his tunge a trewe loue he bere
ffor þerby wende he to be gracious
He roomeþ to the Carpenters hous
And stille he stant vndere þe shot wyndowe
Vnto his brest it raught it was so lowe
And soft he kougheþ wiþ a semy soune
What do ȝe hony combe swete alisoun
My faire brid my swete Synamome  
Awaikeþ lemman myne and spekeþ to me
fful litel þenken ȝe vpon my woo

No wonder is þouȝe that I swelt or swete

Iwis leuman I haue such louelongyng
Þat like a turtel trewe is my mournynge
I may not eten no more þan a maide
Go fro þe wyndowe Iak fool she seide
So god me spede it wil not be compame

Wel bet þan þe by Ihesu absolon
Go forþ þi waie or I wil cast a ston
And lat me slepe a twenty deuelway
Alas quod absolon and weyloway
That trewe loue was euere so euel bysette
Than kisse me siþ it may be no bette
ffor Ihesus loue and for þe loue of me
Wilt þou þan go þi waie þerwith quod she
Ȝe Certes lemman quod þis absolon
þan make þe redy quod she I come anon
    
     
This absolon doune sette hym on his knees


And seid I am a lord at alle degrees
ffor aftere þis I hope þer commeth more
Lemman þi grace and swete brid þine ore
The wyndowe she vndoþ and þat in haste
Haue doo quod she come of and spede þe faste
Lest þat our neigheboures þe espie
þis absolon gan wipe his mouþ ful drie
Derk was þe nyght as picch or as þe cole
And at þe wyndowe out she putt her hole
And absolon him felle no bette ne wers
But wiþ his mouþe he kissed her naked ers
fful sauourly er he was ware of þis
Abak he sterte and þought it was amys
ffor wel he wist a womman haþ no berde  
He felt a þing al roughe and longe yherede
And seide fye alas what haue I doo
Ti he quod she and clapt þe wyndowe to
And absolon goþ forþ a forþer paas
A beerd a beerd seide hende Nicholaas
By goddes corpus þis goþ faire and well
This sely absolon herde it euery dell
And on his lippe he gan for anger bite
And to him self he seide I shal þe quyte
Who rubbeth nowe who freteth nowe his lippes
Wiþ dust wiþ sonde wiþ strawe wiþ cloþ with chippes
But absolon that seiþ ful oft allas
My soule bitake I to Sathanas
But me were leuere þan al þis toune quod he
Of þis despite awroken forto be
Allas quod he allas I ne had ybleynt
His hote love is cold and al yqueynt
ffor fro þat tyme þat he had kist her ers
Of paramours he sette not a kers
ffor he was heled of his malady
fful oft paramours he gan defie
And wepeþ as doþ a child þat is ybete
A softe paas he went ouer þe strete


Vnto a smyth men clepen dann Gervase
That in his forge smyteþ plowh harnase
He sharpeth share and culter bisily
This absolon knokkeþ al Esily
And seide vnto Gervays and þat anon
What who art þou it am I absolon
What Absolon what cristes swete tre
Why rise ȝe so rathe o benedicite
What eileþ ȝou som gay gerle god it wote
Haþ brouȝt ȝou þus on þe Vyritote
By seynt Noet ȝe whote wele what I mene
Þis Absolon ne rouȝte not a bene 
Of al þis pley no word aȝein he gaf  
He had more towe on his dystaf
Þan Gervais knewe and seide frende so dere
Þe hote Cultere in þe Chymeney here
As lene it me I haue þerwiþ to don
I wil bringe it ageyn ful sone
Gervais answerd certes were it gold
Or in a poke nobles al vntold
Thou shuldest haue as I am trewe smyth
A cristes foo what wil ȝe do þerwith
Therof quod absolon be as be may
I shal tellen it þe to morowe day
And caught þe Culter by þe colde stele
fful soft out atte door he gan stele
And went vnto þe Carpentere walle
He koughed first and knokked þer wiþ all
Vppon þe wyndowe right as he did eere
Þis Alison answerde who is þere
Þat knokkeþ so I waraunt it a þeef
We nay quod he god wote my swete leef
I am þine absolon þine derlinge
Of gold quod he I haue þe brouȝt a rynge
My modere ȝaue it me so god me saue
fful fyn it is and þerto wel ygraue


This wil I ȝeuen þe if þowe me kisse
þis Nicholas was risen forto pisse
And þouȝt he wold amenden al þe Iape
He shulde kisse his ers er þat he scape
And vp þe wyndowe did he hastely
And out his ers he putteþ priuely
Ouer þe buttok to þe haunche bon
And þerwiþ spake þis clerk þis absolone
Speke swete bridde I not wher þou art
Þis Nicholas anon lete fleigh a fart
As grete as it had bene a þonder dent
Þat wiþ þe stroke he was almost yblent
And he was redy wiþ his yren hote  
And Nicholas in þe ers he smote
Of goþ þe skyn an honde brede aboute
Þe hote culter brenned so his toute
And for þe smerte he wende forto deye
As he were wood for woo he gan to crye
Help water water helpe for goddys hert
This Carpenter out of his slomber stert
And herde oon crien water as he were wode
And þouȝt allas now commeth noes flode
He sette hym vp wiþout wordes moo
And wiþ an axe he smote þe cord a two
And doun goþ alle he fonde neiþer to selle
Brede nor Ale til he com to þe selle
Vpon þe floor and ther a swoun he lay
Vp stert hir Alison and Nicholay
And criden out and horowe in þe strete
Þe neighbours boþ smale and grete
Ronnen forto gawren on þis man
Þat a swonn lay boþ pale and wan
ffor wiþ þat falle he brusten haþ his arme
But stonden he most vnto his owne harme
ffor whan he spak he was anon born doun
Wiþ hende Nicholas and alisoun


Thei tolde euery man þat he was wode
He was agast so of þe Noes flode
Þorgh fantasie þat of his vanyte
He had ybouȝt hym kneding tubbes þre
And had hem honged in þe roof aboue
And þat he preied hym for goddys loue
To sitten in þe roof par companye
þe folk gan laughen at his fantasie
And to the Roof þei kepen and þei gape
And turned al his harme vnto a Iape
ffor what so þis Carpenter answerd
It was for nouȝt no man his reson herd
Wiþ oþes grete he was so sworn a doun  
That he was holden woode in al þat toun
ffor euere clerk anoon riȝt helde wiþ oþer
þei seide þe man is wood my leue broþer
And euere wight gan laughen at his strif
Thus swyued was þe Carpenters wiff
ffor al his keping and his Ielousie
And Absalon haþ kissed her nethere ye
And Nicholas is scalded in his toute
This tale is don and god saue al þe route
Whan folk han laughen at þis nyce cas
Of absolon and hende Nicholas
Dyuers folk dyuersly þei seide
But for þe more parte þei louȝe and pleide
Ne at þis tale I seghe no man hym greue
But it were only Oswold þe Reue
Bycause he was of Carpenters craft
A litel Ire in his herte laft
He gan to grucche and blamed it a lite
So thick quod he ful wele quouþ I þe quyte
Wiþ blering of a proude Millers ye
If þat me list to speke of Ribawdye
But ik am olde me list not pley for age
Gras tyme is done my foder is forage
This white top writeþ myn olde ȝeeres
Myn hert is al so mowled as myn heeres
But if I fare as doþ an openers
þat ilke fruyte is euer lenger þe wers
Til it be roten in Mullok or in stre
We olde men I drede so fare we
Til we be roten can we not be ripe
We hopen alway while þe hert wil pipe
ffor in our wille þer stikketh euer a naile
To haue an hoor heer and a grene taile
As haþ a leke for þough our myȝt be gon  
Our wille desireþ foly euer in oon
ffor whan we may not don þan wil we speke
Ȝit in oure asshed olde is fire yreke
ffour gledes han we which I shal deuyse
Auauntinge lying angre and coueitise
Thise four sparkles longeþ vnto elde
Our olde lymes may wel bene vnwelde


But wil ne shal not faille þat is soth
And ȝit haue I alwaye a coltes toth
As mony ȝere as it is passed henne
Siþ þat my tap of lif byganne to renne
ffor sikerly whan I was born anōn
Deþ drough þe tappe of lif and lete it gon
And euere siþen haþ so þe tap yronne
Til at almost al empty is þe tonne
The strem of lif now droppeþ on þe chymbe
þe sely tunge may wel rynge and chymbe
Of wrecchednesse þat passed is ful yore
Wiþ olde folk saue dotage is no more
 Whan þat our ooste had herde þis sermonynge
He gan to speke as lordly as a kinge
He seide what amounteþ al þis witte
What shal we speke alday of holy writte
The deuel made a Reue forto preche
Or of a Souter shipman or a lecche
Say forþ þi take and tary not þe tyme
Loo Depford and it is almost prime
Lo Grenwich þat mony a shrewe is Inne
It were hie tyme þi tale forto bygynne
 Now Sirs quod þis Oswold þe Reue
I prei ȝou al þat ȝe ȝou not greue
Þouȝe I answere and somdele sette hys houwe
ffor leeful it is wiþ force force of shouwe
This dronken Miller haþ ytolde vs here
Hou þat bigiled was a Carpentere
Perauenture in scorn for I am oon  
And by ȝoure leue I shal hym quyte anon
Riȝt in his Cheerles teermes wil I speke
I prei to god his nekke mot altobreke
He can wel in myn ye seen a stalk
But in his owne he can not seen a balk
At Trumpington not fer fro Caunterbruge
Ther goþ a broke and over þat a bruge
Vpon þe whiche broke þer stonte a melle
And þis is verrey soþ þat I ȝou telle
A Millere was þere dwelling mony a day
As ony Pecok he was proude and gay
Pipen he couþe an sisshen and nettes bete
And turne Coppes and wel wrastel and shete
Ny by his belt he bare a longe panade
And of a swerd ful trenchant was þe blade
A Ioly popper bere he in his pouche
Ther nas no man for perile durst hym touche
A Sheffeld thwytel bere he in his hose
Rounde was his face and camoyse was his nose
As pilled as an ape was his sculle
He was a market beter atte fulle
þer nas no wight þat durst hond on hym legge
But if he swore he shuld anon abegge
A theef he was forsoþ of corn and mele
And þat a sleegh and vsaunt forto stele
His name was hoten deyneȝouse Symkyn
A wif he hadde commen of nobel kyn
The person of þe toune her fader was
Wiþ hir he ȝaue ful mony a panne of bras
ffor þat Symkyn shuld in his blood allie
She was yfostred in a nonrie
ffor Symkyn wold no wif as he seide
But she were wel ynorshed and a mayde
To Sauen his Astate of ȝemanrie  
And she was proude and peert as is a pie
A ful feire sight was it vpon hem twoo
On holy daies byforn hir wold he goo


Wiþ his typet bounden aboute his hede
And she come aftere in a gite of rede
And Symkyn had hosen of þe same
þer durst no wiȝt clepe hur but dame
Was noon so hardy þat went by þe way
Þat wiþ hir dorst ones rage or play
Bat if he wold be sclayn of Symkyn
Wiþ panade and wiþ knyf or boydekyn
ffor Ielous folk ben perylous euermoo
Algates þei wolde her wyues wenden soo
And eke for she was somdell smoterlich
She was as digne as water in a dich
As ful of hoker and of bismare
Hire þouȝte þat a lady shuld hir spare
What for her kynrede and her nortelrie
Þat she had lerned in þe Nonerie
A douȝtere had þei bitwene hem twoo
Of xxti ȝere wiþouten ony moo
Sauyng a childe þat was of half ȝere age
In cradel it lay and was a propre page
This wenche thik and wel ygrowe was
Wiþ Camoys nose and eyen as grey as glas
Wiþ buttokes brode and brestes round and hie
But riȝt faire was hur heor I wil not lye
 The person of þe toune for she was so faire
In purpoos was to make hir his aire
Boþ of his Catell and of his messuage
And straunge he made it of hur mariage
His purpoos was to bystowe hir hie
Into som worþi blood of Auncetrie
ffor holy churches good most be despended
On holy chirche blood þat is descended
Therfore he wold his holy blood honoure  
þoo þat he holy churche shuld devoure
Grete soken haþ þis mellere out of doute
With whete and malt of al þe londe aboute


And namely þer was a grete colege
Men clepen þe solere halle atte Cauntebrigge
Ther was her whete and eke her malt ygrounde
And on a day it happed in a stounde
Sik lay þe manciple on a maladie
Mon wenden wishly þat he shuld dye
ffor whiche þe Millere stale boþ mele and corn
An hundred tyme more þan byforn
ffor þer byforne he stale but curteisly
But nowe he was a þeef outrageously
ffor which þe wardeyne chidde and made fare
But þerof sette þe Millere not a tare
He craked booste and swore it was not soo
þan were þere yonge scolers two
That dwelten in þe halle of which I seie
Teestif þei were and lusty forto pleye
And only for her merth and reverye
Vpon þe wardeyn bisily þei crie
To ȝeue hem leue but a litel stounde
To goo to melle and se her corn ygrounde
And hardely þei dorst lay her nekke
þe Millere shuld not stele hem half a pekke
Of corn ne by sleight ne by force hem reue
And at þe last þe wardeyn ȝaf hem leue
Iohn hight þat oon an Aleyn hiȝt þat oþer
Of oon toune were þei born þat hight strother
fferre in þe norþe I can not telle where
This Aleyn makeþ redy al his gere
And on an hors þe sak he cast anōn
fforþ goþ Aleyn þe Clerc and also Iohn
Wiþ good swerde and bokeler by her side
Iohn knewe þe way hym neded no gyde
And atte Mille þe Sak a doune he laith  
Alayn spake first alhaille Symonde in faiþ
How fareþ þi fare douȝtere and þi wiff
Aleyn welcome quod Symkyn be my liff


And Iohn also how nowe what do ȝe here
By god quod Iohn Symond nede haþ no pere
Hym byhoueþ serue hym self þat haþ no swayn
Or ellis he is a fool as clerkes sayne
Our manciple I hope he wil be dede
Swa worchen hym ay þe wanges in his hede
And þerfore is I commen and eke Aleyn
To Grynde our corn and carie hit hom ageyn
We prey ȝou spede vs hepen þat ȝe may
It shal be done quod Symkyn be my fay
What wil ȝe done while þat it is in hande
By God riȝt by the hoper wil I stande
Quod Iohn and see how gates þe corn goþ Inne
Ȝit sagh I neuere be my fadere kynne
How þat þe hoper waggeþ til and fraye
Aleyn Answerd Iohan wiltowe swaye
þan wil I be byneþe by my croune
And se howe gate the mele falles adoun
Into þe trough þat shal be my disport
Quod Iohn in faath I may bene of ȝour sorte
I is as il a Miller as is ȝe
This Millere smyled of her nycete
And þouȝt al þis is don but for a wile
þei wene þat no man may hem bygyle
But by my þrift ȝit shal I blere her ye
ffor al þe sleiȝt in her philosophie
The more queynte Clerkes þat þei make
þe more wil I stele whan I take
In stede of floure ȝit wil I ȝeue hem brenne
The grettest clerkes ben not þe wisest men
As whilom to þe wolf þus spake þe mare
Of alle her arte counte I nouȝt a tare
Out at þe Dore he goþ ful priuely  
Whan þat he seghe his tyme softely
He lokeþ vp and doune til he haþ founde
The Clerkes hors þer as he stode ybounde


Behinde þe mylle vndere a leueselle
And to þe hors he goþ hym faire and welle
He strepeþ of þe bridel riȝt anōn
And whan þe hors is louse he gynneþ to gon
Toward þe fenne where wilde Mares renne
And forþewiþ þorgh þikke and þorgh þenne
This Mellere goþ ageyn no word he seide
But doþ his note and wiþ þise clerkes pleide
Til þat her corn was faire and welle ygrounde
And whan þe mele is sakked and ybounde
This Iohn goþ oute and fonde her hors away
And gan to crie harowe and walowway
Our hors is lost aleyn for goddis banes
Steppe on þi fete come of man  al at anes
Allas our wardeyn haþ our palfray lorn
This Aleyn forgate boþ mele and corn
Al was out of his mynde his husbondrie
What whilk way is he gon he gan to crie
Þe wif come lepinge inward at a renne
She seide alas ȝoure hors goþ to þe fenne
With wilde mares as fast as he may goo
Vnþonke come on his honde þat bonde hym soo
And he þat better shuld haue knette þe reyn
Allas quod Iohn Aleyn for cristes peyn
Lay doune þi swerde and I wil myn alswaa
I is ful swift god wate as is a Raa
By goddes hert he shal not scape vs bathe
Whi ne had þou putte þe Capel in þe lathe
Ilhaile by god Aleyn þou is a fonne
Thise sely clerkes han ful fast yronne
Touard þe fenne boþen aleyn an eke Iohn
And whan þe Miller segh þat þei were gon
He half a busshel of her floure haþ take  
And bad his wif go knede it in a cake
And seide I trowe þe clerkes weren aferde
Ȝit kan a Miller make a clerkes beerde


ffor al her arte ȝit lat hem gon her way
Lo wher þei gon ȝe lat þe children play
They gete him not so lightly by my croun
Thise sely clerkes rennen vp and doun
With kepe kepe stonde stonde Iossa warderere
Ga qwistel ȝou I shal kepe hym here
But shortely til it was verrey nyȝt
þei couþe not þoughe þei did al her myȝt
þeire Capel cauche he ranne alway so fast
Til in a dicche þei caught him at þe last
Wery and wete as beestis in þe reyne
Commeþ sely Iohn and wiþ hym commeþ aleyn
Allas quod Iohn þe day þat I was born
Nowe are we dryuen til heþing and to scorn
Our corn is stolle men wil vs foles calle
Boþ þe wardeyn and our felawes alle
And namely þe Meller weylawaye
þus pleyneþ Iohn as he goþ by þe waye
Toward the Melle and baiard in his honde
The Millere sitting by þe fire he fonde
ffor it was nyght and ferþer myght he nouȝt
But for þe loue of god þei hym bisouȝt
Of harborowe and of ease as for her penye
þe Millere seide aȝein if þer be enye
Such as it is ȝete shal ȝe haue ȝoure parte
Myn hous is streite but ȝe han lerned arte
Ȝe can by argumente make a place
A myle brode of xxti fete of space
Lat se nowe if þis place may suffise
Or make it rowmer wiþ speche as is ȝour gise
Now Symond seide þis Iohn be seynt Cutberd
Ay is þou mery  and þat is faire answerde
I haue herde seye men shal taken of two þingges  
Such as he fint or take such as he bringes
But specialy I prey þee hooste dere
Gete vs some mete and drink and make vs chere


And we wil paien trewly atte fulle
Wiþ empty hondes men may not haukes tulle
Lo here our siluer redy forto spende
This Mellere to þe toune his douȝter sende
ffor Ale and brede and rosted hem a goos
And bonde her hors for he shuld no more go loos
And in his owne chambre he made a bedde
Wiþ shetes and wiþ chalons faire yspredde
Nouȝt from his owne bedde x fete or xij
His doughter had a bed al by hir selue
Riȝt in þe same chambre by and by
It myghte be no bette and cause why
þer was no rommer herborowe in þe place
þei soupen and þei speken hem to solace
And drynken euere stronge ale atte beste
About mydnyȝt went þei to reste
Wel haþ þis Mellere vernyssed his hede
fful pale he was fordronken and not rede
He ȝeskeþ and he spekeþ þorgh þe nose
As he ware in þe quakke or on þe pose
To bedde he gooþ and wiþ hym goþ his wif
As eny Iaye he light was and Iolif
So was her Ioly whistel wel ywette
Þe Cradel at her beddis fete is ysette
To Rokken and to ȝeue þe child to souke
And whan þat dronken was al in þe crouke
To bedde went þe doughter riȝt anōn
To bedde goþ Aleyn and also Iohn
þer nas no more hem neded no dwale
This Mellere haþ so wisly bebbed ale
þat as an hors he snorteþ in his slepe
Ne of his tale behynde he toke no kepe
His wif bare him a Burdon a ful stronge  
Men myght here þe routing þens a forlonge
The wenche routeþ eek par companye
Aleyn þe Clerk þat herd þis melodye


He pouked on Iohn and seide slepestowe
Herde þou euere sclike a sang or nowe
Lo sclike a conplinge is ytwix hem alle
A wilde fire on her bodies falle
Who herkened euere sclike a ferly þinge
Ȝe þei shal haue þe floure of euel endinge
This lange nyȝt þer tydes men no reste
But ȝit na fors al shal be for þe beste
ffor Iohn seide he as euere mote I þrive
If þat I may ȝon wenche þan wil I swyve
Some esement haþ lawe shapen vs
ffor Iohn þer is a lawe þat seiþ þus
That if a man in oon point be agreued
That in anoþer he shal be releued
Our corn is stollen soþly it is no nay
And we han had an euel fit to day
And syn I shal haue no amendement
Ageyn my losse I wil haue esement
By goddes saule it sal na noþer be
þis Iohn answerde Aleyn avise þe
The Mellere is a perilous man he seide
And if þat he out of his sclepe abreide
He myghte don vs boþ a vylenye
Aleyn answerd I counte hym not a flye
And vp he rist and by þe wenche he crepte
This wenche lay vpriȝt and faste sclepte
Til he so nygh was er she myȝte spie
þat it had bene to late forto crie
And shortely for to seie þei were at on
Nowe pleye Alayn for I wil speke of Iohn
This Iohn lith stille a forlonge way or two
And to hym self he makeþ wamenting and woo
Allas quod he þis is a wikke Iape  
Now may I seie þat I is but an ape
Ȝit haþ my felawe somwhat for his harme
He haþ þe mellers douȝter in his arme


He Auntreþ hym and haþ his nedes spedde
And I ly as a draf sak in my bedde
And whan þis Iape is tolde anoþer day
I shal be holde a daff a cokenay
I wil arise and aunter be my fath
Vnhardy is vnsely þus men sath
And vp he roos and softely he went
Vnto þe Cradel and in his arme hit hent
And bare it soft vntil his beddes fete
Sone aftere þe wif her rowting lete
And gan to wake and went her out to pisse
And come agein and gan her cradel mysse
And groped here and þere but she foond noon
Allas quod she I had almost mysgon
I had almost go to þe clerkes bedde
Ey benedicite þan had I foule yspedde
And forþ she goþ til she þe cradel fonde
She gropeþ alway forþer wiþ her honde
And fond þe bed and þouȝt nouȝt but of good
By cause þat þe cradel by it stode
And nyste wher she was for it was derk
But faire and wel she crepte in to þe clerk
And lith ful stille and wolde haue kauȝt a slepe
WiþIn a while þis Iohn þe clerk vp lepe
And on þis good wif hee leiþ ful sore
So mery a fitte ne had she not ful ȝore
And prikeþ harde and depe as he ware madde
Þis Ioly lif han þise two clerkes ladde
To þat þe iij coke bygan to singe
Aleyn wexe wery in þe dawnynge
ffor he had swonken al þe longe nyȝt
And seide fare wel malyn sweete wiȝt
The day is come I may no lenger byde  
But euermo where so I go or ride
I am þine owne clerk so haue I sele
Now dere lemman quod she go fare wele


But er þou goo on þinge I wil þe telle
Whhan þat þow wendest homward by þe melle
Right at þe entre of þe door behinde
Thow shalt a Cake of half a busshel fynde
That was ymaked of þine owne mele
Which þat I helpe my Sire forto stele
And good lemman god þe saue and kepe
And wiþ þat word almost she gan to wepe
Aleyn vprist and þouȝt er þat it dawe
I wol go crepen in by my felawe
And fonde þe cradel wiþ his honde anon
By god þought he alwrong  I haue mysgon
Myn hede is toty of my swynk to nyght
Þat makeþ me þat I go not aright
I wote wele by þe cradel I haue mysgo
Here lith þe meller and his wif also
And forþ he goþ on twenty delway
Vnto þe bedde þer as þe meller lay
He wende haue cropen by his felawe Iohn
And by þe Meller in he crept anon
And kaught him by þe nek and soft he spake
And seide þou Iohn þou swyneshede awake
Of Cristes saule and here a noble game
ffor by þat lord þat called is seint Iame
As I haue þries in þis shorte nyȝt
Swyved þe Mellers douȝter bolt vpriȝt
Whilst þow hast as a Coward ben agast
Ye fals harlot quod þe Mellere hast
A fals traitour fals clerk quod he
Þow shalt be dede by goddes dignyte
Who durste be so bolde to disparage
My douȝter þat is come of swich lynage
And by þe þrote bolle he kauȝt aleyn  
And he him hent dispitously ageyn
And on þe nose he smote hym with his fist
Doune ranne þe blody streme vpon his brist


And in þe floor wiþ nose and mouþ tobroke
þei walowen as don two pigges in a poke
And vp þei goon and doune anon
Till þat þe Mellere spurned at a ston
And downe he felle bakward vpon his wiff
þat wist no þinge of þis nyce striff
ffor she was falle a slepe a litel wiȝt
Wiþ Iohn þe clerk þat waked had al nyȝt
And wiþ þe falle out of her slepe she braide
Help holy crosse of bromholm she saide
In manus tuas lorde to þe I calle
Awake Symond þe feend is on me falle
Myn hert is broken help I ne am but dede
þere lith vpon my wombe and on myn hede
Helpe Symkyn for þise fals clerkes fiȝt
This Iohn stert vp as fast as euere he myȝt
And grasped by þe walles to and fro
To fynden a staf and she stert vp also
And knewe þe Eisters bet þan did Iohn
And by þe walle she fonde a staf anōn
And segh a litel shymering of a liȝt
ffor at an hole in shone þe mone briȝt
And by þat liȝt she segh hem boþ two
But sikerly she nyste who was who
But as she seegh a white þinge in her eye
And whan she gan þis white þing aspie
She wende þe Clerk had wered a volipere
And wiþ þe staf she drough ay ner and nere
And wende han hitte þis Aleyn atte fulle
And smote þe Mylere on þe pyled skulle
Þat doun he goth and cried harowe I dye
Thise Clerkes bette hym wel and lete hym lye
And Greieþ hem and toke her hors anon  
And eke her mele and on her way þei gōn
And at the Melle ȝit þei toke her Cake
Of half a busshel floure ful wel ybake


Thus is þe proude Mellere wel ybete
And hath ylost þe grynding of þe whete
And paide for þe soper euery dell
Of aleyn and of Iohn þat bette hym well
His wiff is swyued and his douȝtere als
Lo such it is a Miller to be fals
And þerfor þis prouerbe is seide ful soth
Hym ther not wene wele þat euel doth
A Gilour shal hym self begiled be
And god þat sitteþ hegh in mageste
Saue al þe company grete and smale
Thus haue I quytte þe Meller in my tale
The Coke of london while þe Reue spak
ffor Ioye him þouȝt he clawed hym on þe bak
Ha ha quod he for cristes passion
This Millere haþ a sharpe conclusion
Vpon his argument of harbigage
Wel seide Salomon in his langage
Ne bringe not euery man into þine hous
ffor herbowringe by nyght is perilous
Wel ouȝt a man avised forto be
Whoom þat he brouȝt into his pryvete
I prey to god so ȝeue me sorowe and care
If euer siþen I hight hogge of ware
Herd I Meller better ysette a werke
He had a Iape of malice in þe derke
And þerfor if ȝe vouche sauf to here
But god forbede þat we stynt heere
A tale of me þat am a poor man
I wil ȝou telle as wel as euer I can
A litel Iape þat felle in our Cite  
Our hooste answerd and seide I graunte it þe
Now telle on Rogger and loke þat it be good
ffor mony a paast hast þou laten blood
And mony a Iak of Douer last þou sold
þat haþ be twies hoote and twies cold
Of mony a pilgryme hast þou cristes curs
ffor of þi Persely ȝit fare þei þe wors
þat þei han eten wiþ þi stobel goos
ffor in þi shoppe is mony a flee loos
Now telle on gentil Rogger by þi name
But ȝit I prei þe be not wroþ for game
A man may say ful soþ in game and play
Þow seist ful soþ quod Rogger be my fay


But soþ play quade play as þe flemmyng saiþ
And þerfore henry balyf by þi feiþ
Be þow not wroþ er we departen here
þoughe þat my tale be of an ostylere
But naþelees I wil not tellen it ȝit
But er we part Iwis þou shalt be quyt
And þerwiþ al  lough and made chere
And saide his tale as ȝe shal after here
APrentis whilom dwelled in our Cite
And of a craft of vitalers was he
Gailard he was as goldfynch in þe shawe
Broun as þe bery a propre short felawe
Wiþ lockes blake ykempt ful fetisly
Daunce he couþe so wel and Iolily
Þat he was cleped Perkyn reveilour
He was as ful of loue and paramour
As is þe hyve ful of hony swete
Wel was þe wenche wiþ him myȝt mete
And euery Bridale wold he sing and hoppe
He loued bette þe Tauern þan þe shoppe
ffor whan þer eny ridynge was in chepe  
Out of þe Shoppe þidere wold he lepe
Til þat he had al þe siȝt yseyn
And daunsed wel wold he not come ageyn
And gader hym a mayne of his sort
To hoppe and synge and make such disport
And þer þei setten steuen forto mete
To pleyn at þe dis in such a strete
ffor in þe toune nas þer no prentys
þat fairrer couþe cast a peire of dys
þan perkyn couþe and þerto he was free
Of his dispence in place of pryvete
That fonde his maister wel in his chaffare
ffor oft tymes he fonde his boxe ful bare
ffor sikerly a prentise Reveilour
Þat haunteþ dis ryot and paramour
His maister shulde in his shop abye
Al haue he not part of þe mynstralcie
ffor þeft and riot þei ben conuertible
Al conne he pley on gitern or rubible


Reuel and trouþe as in a lough degre
þei ben ful wroþ alday as men may see
Þis Ioly Prentis wiþ his maister bode
Til he were nygh out of his prentisehode
Al were he snybbed erly or late
And somtyme ladde wiþ revel to Newgate
But atte last his maister hym byþouȝte
Vpon a day whan he his paper souȝte
Of a prouerd þat seiþ þis same word
Wel bette is roten appel out of horde
þan þat it rote al þe remenaunte
So fareþ it by a ryotous seruaunte
It is moche lasse harme to lat hym passe
þan he sheed alle þe seruauntes in þe place
Therfor his maister ȝaue hym a quytaunce
And bad hym goo wiþ sorowe and meschaunce
And þus þis prentise had his leue  
Now lat him riot al þe nyȝt or leue
And for þer is no þeef wiþout a louke
þat helpeþ hym to waasten or to souke
Of þat he bribe can or borowe may
Anon he sent his bedde and his aray
Vnto a conper of his owne sort
þat loued dys  reuel and disport
And had a wif þat helde for countenaunce
A Shop and swyued for her sustenaunce
But hereof I wil pas as nowe
And of yonge Gamelyn I wil telle ȝou
Liþes and listneþ and harkneþ ariȝt
And ȝe shul here of a doughty knyȝt
Sir Iohn of boundes was his name
He coude of Norture and of mochel game
Thre sones þe knyght had and wiþ his body he wan
The eldest was a moche schrewe and sone bygan
His breþer loued wel her fader and of him were agast
Þe eldest deserued his faders curs and had it atte last
Þe good knyght his fadere lyued so yore
Þat deþ was commen to hym  and handled hym ful sore
Þe Good knyght cared sore  sik þer he lay
How his children shuld lyuen after his day
He had ben wide where  but non husbonde he was
Al þe londe þat he had it was purchas
ffayn he wold it were dressed among hem alle
That eche of hem had his parte as it myȝt falle
þoo sente he in to contrey after wise knyȝtes
To helpen delen his londes and dressen hem to riȝtes
He sent hem word by letters þei shul hie blyve
Yf þei wolk speke wiþ hym whilst he was a lyve


Whan þe knyȝtes harden sik þat he lay
Had þei no rest neiþer nyȝt ne day
Til þei come to hym þer he lay stille
On his deþes bedde to abide goddys wille
Than seide þe good knyght seke þer he lay  
Lordes I ȝou warne for soþ wiþout nay
I may no lenger lyuen here in þis stounde
fsor þorgh goddis wille deþ droueþ me to grounde
þer nas noon of hem alle þat herd hym ariȝt
þat þei ne had routh of þat ilke knyȝt
And seide sir for goddes loue dismay ȝou nouȝt
God may don boote of bale þat is now ywrouȝt
þan speke þe good knyȝt sik þer he lay
Boote of bale god may sende I wote it is no nay
But I bisecche ȝou knyȝtes for þe loue of me
Goþ and dresseþ my londes among my sones þre
And for þe loue of god deleþ not amys
And forgeteþ not Gamelyne my ȝong sonne þat is
Takeþ hede to þat oon as wel as to þat oþere
Seelde ȝe seen eny hier  helpen his broþere
þoo lete þei þe knyght lyen þat was not in hele
And wenten into counsell his londes forto dele
Forto delen hem alle to on þat was her þouȝt
And for Gamelyn was ȝongest he shuld haue nouȝt
All þe londe þat þer was þei dalten it in two
And lete Gamelyne þe ȝonge without londe goo
And eche of hem seide to other ful loude
His breþeren myȝt ȝeue him londe whan he good cowde
And whan þei had deled þe londe at her wille
þei commen to þe knyght  þer he lay stille
And tolde him anoon how þei had wrouȝt
And þe knyght þere he laye liked it riȝt nouȝt
 Than seide þe knyȝt be seint Martyne
For al þat ȝe han done ȝit is the londe myne
fsor goddis loue neighbours  stondeþ alle stille
And I wil delen my londe after myn owne wille


Iohn myne eldest sone shal haue plowes fyve
þat was my faders heritage whan he was alyve
And my myddelest sone v plowes of londe
þat I halpe forto gete with my riȝt honde
And al myn oþere purchace of londes and ledes  
þat I biqueþe Gamelyn  and al my good stedes
And I biseche ȝou good men þat lawe conne of londe
For Gamelynes loue þat my quest stonde
Thus dalt þe knyȝt  his londe by his day
Riȝt on his deþ bed sik þer he lay
And sone afterward he lay stoon stille
And deide whan tyme come as it was cristes wille
Anoon as he was dede and vnder gras graue
Sone þe elder broþer giled þe ȝonge knaue
He toke into his honde his londe and his lede
And Gamelyne him seluen to cloþe and to fede
He cloþed him and fedde him euell and eke wrothe
And lete his londes forfare and his houses boþe
His Parkes and his wodes and did no þing welle
And siþen he it abouȝt on his owne felle
So longe was Gamelyne in his broþers halle
ffor þe strengest of good will þei douted hym alle
Þer was noon þerInne neiþer ȝonge ne olde
Þat wold wrethe Gamelyn were he neuer so bolde
Gamelyne stood on a day in his broþeres ȝerde
And byganne wiþ his hond to handel his berde
He þouȝt on his landes þat lay vnsowe
And his fare okes þat doune were ydrawe
His Parkes were broken and his deer reued
Of alle his good stedes noon was hym byleued
His hous were vnhilled and ful euell diȝt
Tho þouȝt Gamelyne it went not ariȝt
 Afterward come his broþer walking þare
And seide to Gamelyn is our mete ȝare
Tho wrathed him Gamelyn and swore by goddys boke
Þow shalt go bake þi self I wil not be þi coke


What broþer Gamelyne howe answerst þou nowe
þou spekest neuere such a word as þou dost nowe
By feiþe seide Gamelyn now me þenkeþ nede
Of al þe harmes þat I haue I toke neuere ȝit hede
My parkes bene broken and my dere reued  
Of myn armes ne my stedes nouȝt is byleued
All þat my fader me byquaþe al goþ to shame
And þerfor haue þou goddes curs broþere be þi name
þan spake his broþer þat rape was and rees
Stond stille Gadlynge and holde þi pees
Thou shalt be fayn to haue þi mete and þi wede
What spekest þow gadeling  of londe or of lede
Than seide Gamelyn þe child so ȝing
Cristes curs mote he haue þat me clepeth Gadelinge
I am no wors Gadeling ne no wors wiȝt
But born of a lady and gete of a knyȝt
Ne dorst he not to Gamelyn neuere a foot goo
But cleped to hym his men and seide to hem þoo
Goþ and beteþ þis boye and reueþ hym his witte
And lat him lerne anoþer tyme to answer me bette
Than seide þe Child ȝonge Gamelyn
Cristes curs mote þou haue broþer art þou myn
And if I shal algates be beten anōn
Cristes curs mote þou haue but þou be þat on
And anon his broþer in þat grete hete
Made his men to fette staues Gamelyn to bete
Whan euery of hem had a staf ynommen
Gamelyn was werre  whan he segh hem commen
Whan Gamelyne segh hem commen he loked ouer all
And was ware of a pestel stode vnder þe wall
Gamelyn was liȝt and þider gan he lepe
And droof alle his broþeres men riȝt sone on an hepe
And loked as a wilde lyon and leide on good wone
And whan his broþer segh þat he byganne to gon
He fley vp into a loft and shette þe door fast
þus Gamelyn wiþ his pestel made hem al agast


Some for Gamelyns loue and some for eye
Alle þei droughen hem to halues whan he gan to pleye
 What nowe seide Gamelyn euel mote ȝe the
Wil ȝe bygynne contecte and so sone flee
Gamelyn souȝt his broþer whider he was flowe  
And seghe where he loked out a wyndowe
Broþere seide Gamelyn come a litel nere
And I wil teche þe a play at þe bokelere
His broþere him ansuerde and seide by seint Richere
þe while þat pestel is in þine honde I wil come no nere
Broþer I wil make þi pees I swer by cristes oore
Cast away þe pestel and wreþe þe no more
I most nede seide Gamelyn wreþ me at onys
ffor þou wold make þi men to breke my bonys
Ne had I hadde mayn and myȝt in myn armes
To han hem fro me  þei wold haue don me harmes
Gamelyn seide his broþer be þou not wroth
Forto sene þe han harme me were riȝt loth
I ne did it not broþer but for a fondinge
ffor to loken wher þou art stronge and art so ȝenge
Come a doune þan to me and graunt me my bone
Of oon þing I wil þe axe and we shal sauȝt sone
Doune þan come his broþer þat fikel was and felle
And was swiþ sore afeerd of þe pestelle
He seide broþer Gamelyn axe me þi bone
And loke þou me blame but I it graunte sone
Þan seide Gamelyn broþer Iwys
And we shul be at on þou most graunte me this
All þat my fader me byquaþ whilst he was alyue
Þow most do me it haue if we shul not strive
Þat shalt þou haue Gamelyn I swere bi cristes oore
Al þat þi fadere þe byquaþe þough þou wold haue more
Thy londe þat lith ley wel it shal be sawe
And þine houses reised vp þat bene leide ful lawe
Thus seide þe knyght  to gamelyn wiþ mouþe
And þouȝt on falsnes as he wel couþe


þe knyȝt þouȝt on treson and gamelyn anon
And wente and kissed his broþer and whan þei were at on
Alas yonge Gamelyn no þing he ne wist
Wiþ such fals treson  his broþer him kist
Lyþeneth and listeneþ and holdeþ ȝour tonge  
And ȝe shul here talking of Gamelyn þe ȝonge
 Ther was þere bisiden cride a wrastelinge
And þerfore þer was sette a ramme and a ringe
And Gamelyn was in wille to wende þerto
fforto preuen his myȝt what he coude doo
Broþere seide Gamelyn by seint Richere
þow most lene me to nyȝt a litel coursere
That is fresshe fro þe spore on for to ride
I most on an erand a litel here beside
By god seide his broþer of stedes in my stalle
Goo and chese þe the best spare non of hem alle
Of stedes and of coursers þat stoden hem byside
And telle me good broþer whider þou wilt ride
Here beside broþer is cried a wrastelinge
And þerfore shal be sette a ram and a ringe
Moche worchip it were broþere to vs alle
Might I þe ram and þe ring bring home to þis halle
A stede ther was sadeled smertly an skete
Gamelyn did a peire spores fast on his fete
He sette his foote in þe stirop þe stede he bistrode
And towardes þe wrasteling þe yong childe rode
 Whan Gemelyn þe ȝonge was riden out atte gate
þe fals knyȝt his broþer loked it after þate
And bysouȝt Ihesu crist þat is heuene kinge
He myght breke his necke in þe wrestelinge
As sone as Gamelyn come þer þe place was
He light doune of his stede and stood on þe gras
And þer he herde a frankeleyn weiloway singe
And bygonne bitterly his hondes for to wringe
Good man seide Gamelyn whi mast þou þis fare
Is þer no man þat may ȝou helpen out of care


Allas seide þis frankeleyn þat euere was I bore
ffor twey stalworþ sones I wene þat I haue lore
A champion is in þe place þat haþ wrouȝt me sorowe
ffor he haþ sclayn my two sones but ȝif god hem borowe
I wil ȝeue x li by Ihesu crist and more  
Wiþ þe nones I fonde a man wold handel hym sore
Good man seide Gamelyn wilt þou wele don
Holde my hors þe whiles my man drowe of my shon
And helpe my man to kepe my cloþes and my stede
And I wil to place gon  to loke if I may spede
By god seide þe ffrankeleyn it shal be don
I wil my self be þi man to drowe of þi shon
And wende þou into place Ihesu crist þe spede
And drede not of þi cloþes ne of þi good stede
Barefoot and vngirt Gamelyn Inne came
Alle þat were in þe place  hede of him name
Howe he durst auenture him to don his myȝt
þat was so doghty a champiōn in wrasteling and in fiȝt
Vp stert þe Champion rapely anōn
And toward yong Gamelyn byganne to gōn
And seide who is þi fadere and who is þi sire
ffor sothe þou art a grete fool þat thou come hire
Gamelyn answerd þe Champion þo
Thowe knewe wel my fadere while he myȝt goo
þe whiles he was alyue by seynt Martyn
Sir Iohn of Boundes was his name and I am Gamelyn
 ffelawe seide þe Champiōn so mote I þrive
I knewe wel þi fadere þe whiles he was alyue
And þi silf Gamelyn I wil þat þou it here
While þou were a ȝong boy a moch shrewe þou were
Than seide Gamelyn and swore by cristes ore
Now I am older wexe þou shalt finde me a more
By god seide þe Champion welcome mote þou be
Come þow onys in my honde  þou shalt neuere the
It was wel wiþin þe nyȝt and þe mone shone
Whan Gamelyn and þe Champion togider gon gone


The Champion cast turnes to Gamelyn þat was prest
And Gamelyn stode and bad hym done his best
Than seide Gamelyn to þe Champioun
Þowe art fast aboute to bringe me adoun
Now I haue proued mony turnes of þine  
Thow most he seide oon or ij of myne
Gamelyn to þe Champion ȝede smertely anōn
Of alle þe turnes þat he couþe he shewed hym but on
And cast him on þe lift side þat þre ribbes tobrake
And þerto his owne arme þat ȝaf a grete crake
Than seide Gamelyn smertly anōn
Shal it bihold for a cast or ellis for nōn
By god seide þe Champion whedere it bee
He þat commeþ ones in þi honde shal he neuere the
 Than seide þe frankeley þat had þe sones þere
Blessed be þou Gamelyn þat euere þou bore were
The ffrankleyn seide to þe Champion on hym stode hym non eye
This is ȝonge Gamelyn þat tauȝt þe þis pleye
Aȝein answerd þe Chamþion þat likeþ no þing wel
He is alþer maister and his pley is riȝt fell
Siþen y wrasteled first it is goon ȝore
But I was neuer in my lif handeled so sore
Gamelyn stode in þe place anon wiþout serk
And seide ȝif þer be moo lat hem come to werk
The Champion þat pyned hym to worch sore
It semeþ by his countenaunce þat he wil no more
Gamelyin in þe place stood stille as stone
ffor to abide wrastelinge but þer come nonē
Þer was noon wiþ gamelyn þat wold wrastel more
ffor he handeled the Champion so wonderly sore
Two gentile men þat ȝemed þe place
Come to Gamelyin god ȝeue hym good grace
And seide to hym do on · þi hosen and þi shoone
ffor soþ at þis tyme þis fare is done
And þan seide Gamelyn so mot I wel fare
I haue not ȝete haluendele sold my ware


þoo seide þe Champion so broke I my swere
He is a fool þat þerof bieþ þou selleþ it so dere
Tho saide þe ffrankeleyn þat was in moch care
ffelawe he saide whi lackest þou þis ware
By sante Iame of Gales þat mony man haþ souȝt  
Ȝit is it to good chepe þat þow hast bouȝt
Thoo þat wardeynes were of þat wrasteling
Come and brouȝt Gamelyn þe Ramme and þe rynge
    
     
And Gamelyn biþouȝt him it was a faire þinge
And went wiþ moche Ioye home in þe mornynge
 His broþer see wher he came wiþ þe grete route
And bad shitt þe gate and hold hym wiþ oute
The Porter of his lord was soor a gaast
And stert anoon to þe gate and lokked it fast
 Now lithenes and listneþ boþ ȝonge and olde
And ȝe shul here gamen of Gamelyn þe bolde
Gamelyn come to þe gate for to haue come Inne
And it was shett fast wiþ a strong pynne
Þan seide Gamelyn Porter vndo þe ȝate
ffor good mennys sones stonden þerate
þan answerd þe porter and swore by goddys berde
Þow ne shalt Gamelyn come into þis ȝerde
Thow lixt seide Gamelyn so broke I my chyne
He smote þe wikett wiþ his foote and breke awaie þe pynne
The Porter seie þoo it myȝt no better be
He sette foote on erth and bygan to flee
By my feye seide Gamelyn þat travaile is ylore
ffor I am of fote as light as þou if þou haddest it swore
Gamelyn ouertoke þe porter and his tene wrake
And girt him in þe nek þat þe boon tobrake
And toke hym by þat oon arme and threwe hym in a welle
vijc fadme it was depe as I haue herd telle
 Whan Gamelyn þe yonge þus had plaied his playe
Alle þat in þe yerde were drowen hem awaye


Þei dredden him ful sore for werk þat he wrouȝt
And for þe faire company þat he þider brouȝt
Gamelyn ȝede to þe gate and lete it vp wide
He lete Inne all þat gon wold or ride
And seide ȝe be welcome wiþ out eny greue
ffor we wil be maisters here and axe no man leue
Ȝusterday I left seide ȝonge Gamelyn  
In my broþers seler v tonne of wyn
I wil not þis company partyn atwynne
And ȝe wil done after me while sope is þerInne
And if my broþer gruche or make foule chere
Eiþer for spence of mete and drink þat we spende here
I am oure Catour and bere our alþer purs
He shal haue for his grucching seint Maries curs
My broþer is a Nigon I swere be cristes oore
And we wil spende largely þat he haþ spared yore
And who þat make grucchinge þat we here dwelle
He shal to þe porter in to þe drowewelle
Vij dayes and vij nyȝtes Gamelyn helde his feest
Wiþ moche solace was þer noon cheest
In a litel torret his broþer lay steke
And see hem waast his good and dorst no word speke
Erly on a mornynge on þe viij day
The Gestes come to Gamelyn and wolde gon her way
Lordes seide Gamelyn wil ȝe so hie
Al þe wyne is not ȝit dronke so brouke I myn ye
Gamelyn in his hert was ful woo
Whan his gestes toke her leue fro hym forto go
He wolde þei had dwelled lenger and þei seide nay
But bytaught Gamelyn god and good day
Thus made Gamelyn his feest and brouȝt wel to ende
And aftere his gestes toke leue to wende
 Lythen and listen and holde ȝour tunge
And ȝe shal here Game of Gamelyn þe ȝonge
Harkeneth lordingges and listeneþ ariȝt
Whan alle gestis were goon how gamelyn was diȝt


Alle þe while þat Gamelyn heeld his Mangerye
His broþere þouȝt on hym be wroke with his trecherye
Whan Gamylyns gestes were riden and gon
Gamelyn stood anon allone frend had he non
Tho aftere felle sone within a litel stounde
Gamelyn was taken and ful hard ybounde
fforþ Come þe fals knynght out of þe Solere  
To Gamelyn his broþer he ȝede ful nere
And saide to Gamelyn who made þe so bold
For to stroien þe stoor of myn household
Broþer seide Gamelyn wreþ þe riȝt nought
ffor it is many day gon siþ it was bouȝt
ffor broþer þou hast had by seint Richere
Of xv plowes of londe þis xvj ȝere
And of alle þe beestes þou hast forþ bredde
That my fader me byquath on his deþes bedde
Of al þis xvj ȝere I ȝeue þe þe prowe
ffor þe mete and þe drink þat we han spended nowe
Than seide þe fals knyȝt euel mote he þee
Herken broþere Gamelyn what I wil ȝeue þe
ffor of my body broþer here geten haue I none
I wil make þe myn heire I s ere by seint Iohn
Parfay seide Gamelyn and if it so be
And þou thenk as þou seist god ȝeeld it þe
No þinge wist Gamelyn of his broþer gile
Therfore he hym bygiled in a litel while
Gamelyn seide oon þing I þe telle
þoo þou þrewe my porter in þe drowewelle
I swore in þat wreþe and in þat grete moote
þat þou shuldest be bounde boþe honde and fote
    
     
This most be fulfilled my men to dote
ffor to holden myn avowe as I þe bihote
 Broþer seide Gamelyn as mote I þee
Þou shalt not be forswore for þe loue of me


Tho maden þei Gamelyn to sitte and not stonde
To þei had hym bounde boþ fote and honde
þe fals knyght his broþer of Gamelyn was agast
And sent efter fetters to fetter hym fast
His broþer made lesingges on him þer he stode
And tolde hem þat commen Inne þat Gamelyn was wode
Gamelyn stode to a post bounden in þe hall
Þoo þat commen Inne loked on hym all
Euer stode Gamelyn euen vpriȝt  
But mete and drink had ne noun neiþer day ne nyȝt
Than seide Gamelyn brother be myn hals
Nowe haue I aspied þou art a party fals
Had I wist þe Treson þat hast yfounde
I wold haue ȝeue strokes or I had be bounde
Gamelyn stode bounde stille as eny stone
Tho daies and two nyȝtes mete had he none
Than seide Gamelyn þat stood ybound stronge
Adam Spencer me þenkeþ I fast to longe
Adam Spencere now I biseche þe
ffor þe moche loue my fadere loued þe
If þou may come to þe keys lese me out of bonde
And I wil part wiþ þe of my free londe
Than seide Adam þat was þe spencere
I haue serued þi broþer þis xvj ȝere
Ȝif I lete þe gone out of his boure
He wold saye afterwardes I were a tratour
Adam seide Gamelyn so brouke I myn hals
Thow shalt finde þi broþer at þe last fals
Therfore broþer Adam lose me out of bondes
And I will parte wiþ þe of my free londes
Vp such forward seide Adam ywis
I wil do þerto al þat in me is
Adam seide Gamelyn as mote I þe
I wil holde þe Conaunte and þou wil me 
Anoon as Adams lord to bed was gon
Adam toke þe kayes and lete Gamelyn out anon


He vnlocked Gamelyn boþ hondes and fete
In hope of auauncement þat he hym byhete
Than seide Gamelyn þonked be goddis sonde
Nowe I am lose boþ fote and honde
Had I nowe eten and dronken ariȝt
Þer is noon in þis hous shuld bynde me þis nyȝt
Adam toke Gamelyn as stille as eny stone
And ladde him into þe spence raply anone
And sette him to sopere riȝt in a privey styde  
He bad hym do gladly and so he dide
Anoon as Gamelyn had eten wel and fyne
And þerto ydronken wel of þe rede wyne
Adam seide Gamelyn what is nowe þi rede
Or I go to my broþer and Gerd of his his hede
Gamelyn seide Adam it shal not be so
I can teche þe a rede þat is worþ þe twoo
I wote wel forsoþ þat þis is no nay
We shul haue a Mangerye riȝt on sonday
Abbotes and Priours mony here shul be
And oþer men of holy chirch as I telle þe
Þou shal stonde vp by þe post as þou were bounde fast
And I shal leue hem vnloke þat away þou may hem cast
Whan þat þei han eten and wasshen her handes
þow shalt biseche hem alle to bringe þe out of bondes
And if þei willen borowe þe þat were good game
þan were þou out of prison and  out of blame
And if ecche of hem saye to vs nay
I shal do anoþer I swere by þis day
Þow shalt haue a good staf and I wil haue anoþere
And cristes curs haf þat on þat failleþ þat oþere
Ȝe for god seide Gamelyn I say it for me
If I faille on my side evel mot I þee
If we shul algate assoille hem of her synne
Warne me brother Adam whan we shul bygynne
Gamelyn seid Adam by seint charite
I wil warne þe biforn whan it shal be


Whan I winke on þe loke forto gone
And caste away þi fetters and come to me anon
Adam seide Gamelyn blessed be þi bonys
Þat is a good counseile ȝeuen for þe nonys
Ȝif þei warne me þe to bring out of bondes
I wil sette good strokes riȝt on here lendes
Whan þe Sonday was commen and folk to þe feest
ffaire þei were welcomed boþ leest and mest
And euer as þei at þe haldore come Inne  
They casten her yen on ȝonge Gamelyn
The fals knyȝt his broþer ful of trecherye
Al þe gettes þat þer were at þe mangerye
Of Gamelyn his broþer he tolde hem wiþ mouþe
Al þe harme and þe shame þat he telle couþe
Whan þei were yserued of messes ij or thre
Þan seide Gamelyn howe serue ȝe me
It is not wel serued by god þat all made
Þat I sitte fastinge and oþer men make glade
The fals knyȝt his broþer þer as he stode
Told to all þe gestes þat Gamelyn was wode
And Gamelyn stode stille and answerd nouȝt
But Adames wordes he helde in his þouȝt
Thoo Gamelyn gan speke doolfully wiþall
To þe grete lordes þat seten in þe hall
 Lordes he seide for cristes passion
Helpe to bringe Gamelyn out of prison
Þan seide an Abbot sorowe on his cheke
He shal haue cristes curs and seint Maries eke
That þe out of prison beggeþ or borowe
And euer worþ him wel þat doþ þe moche sorowe
After þat Abbot þan speke anoþere
I wold þine hede were of þough þou were my broþere
All þat þe borowe foule mot hem falle
Thus þei seiden alle þat were in þe halle
 Than seide a Priour euel mote he preue
It is grete sorowe and care boy þat þou art alyue


Ow seide Gamelyn so brouke I my bone
Now haue I spied þat frendes haue I non
Cursed mote he worþ boþ flessh and blood
Þat euer doþ Priour or Abbot eny good
Adam þe Spencere toke vp þe cloth
And loked on Gamelyn and segh þat he was wroþe
Adam on the Pantry litel he þouȝt
And two good staues to þe halle door he brouȝt
Adam loked on Gamelyn and he was warre anon  
And cast away þe fetters and bygan to gon
Whan he come to Adam he toke þat on staf
And bygan to worch and good strokes ȝaf
Gamelyn come into þe halle and þe Spencer boþe
And loked hem aboute as þei hadden be wroþe
Gamelyn spreyneþ holy watere wiþ an oken spire
That some þat stode vpriȝt felle in þe fire
þer was no lewe man þat in þe halle stode
þat wolde do Gamelyn eny þing but good
But stoden bisides and lete hem boþ wirch
ffor þei had no rewþe of men of holy chirch
Abbot or Priour monk or chanoun
That Gamelyn ouertoke anon þei ȝeden doun
Ther was noon of alle þat with his staf mette
Þat he ne made hem ouerþrowe to quyte hem his dette
Gamelyn seide Adam for seint charite
Pay good lyuere for þe loue of me
And I wil kepe þe door so euere here I masse
Er þei bene assoilled þer shal non passe
Doute þe not seide Gamelyn whil we ben in fere
Kepe þowe wel þe door and I wil wirche here
Bystere þe good adam and lete non fle
And we shul telle largely how mony þat þer be
Gamelyn seide Adam do hem but goode
Þei bene men of holy church drowe of hem no blode
Saue wel þe crownes and do hem no harmes
But breke boþ her Iogges and siþen her armes


Thus Gamelyn and Adam wrouȝt ryȝt fast
And pleide wiþ þe monkes and made hem agast
Þidere þei come ridinge Ioly wiþ swaynes
And home aȝein þei were ladde in cartes and waynes
Tho þei hadden al ydo þan seide a grey frere
Allas Sir abbot what did we nowe here
Whan þat we commen hidere it was a cold rede
Vs had be bet haue be at home with water and brede
While Gamelyn made orders of monke and frere  
Euere stood his broþer and made foule chere
Gamelyn vp wiþ his staf þat he wel knewe
And girt hym in þe nek þat he ouer thrwe
A litel aboue þe Girdel þe Riggeboon he brast
And sette him in þe fetters þer he sat arst
Sitte þer broþer seide Gamelyn
fforto colen þi body as I did myn
As swith as þei had wroken hem on her foon
Þei asked water and wasshen anon
What some for her loue and some for her Awe
All þe seruauntes serued hem on þe best lawe
þe Sherreue was þennes but v myle
And all was tolde him in a lytel while
Howe Gamelyn and Adam had ydo a sorye rees
Bounden and wounded men aȝeinst þe kingges pees
Tho bygan sone strif for to wake
And þe shereff about Gamelyn forto take
 Now liþen and listen so god ȝeue ȝou good fyne
And ye shul here good game of yonge Gamelyne
xxiijjti ȝonge men þat helde hem ful bold
Come to þe shiref and seide þat þei wold
Gamelyn and Adam fette by her fay
The Sheref ȝaue hem leue soþ for to say
Thei hiden fast wold þei not lynne
To þei come to þe gate þere Gamelyn was Inne
Thei knocked on þe gate þe porter was nyȝe
And loked out att an hool as man þat was scleȝe


þe Porter had bihold hem a litel while
He loued wel Gamelyn and was dradde of gyle
And lete þe wikett stonde ful stille
And asked hem wiþ out what was her wille
ffor all þe grete company speke but oōn
Vndo þe gate porter and lat vs in gon
Þan seide þe Porter so brouke I my chyn
Ȝe shul saie ȝoure erand er ȝe come Inne
Sey to Gamelyn and Adam if þeire wil be  
We wil speke wiþ hem two wordes or þre
ffelawe seide þe Porter stonde þer stille
And I wil wende to Gamelyn to wete his wille
Inne went þe porter to Gamelyn anōn
And saide sir I warne ȝou here ben commen ȝour foon
The Shireues men bene at þe gate

Go ageyn to þe gate and dwelle wiþ hem a while
And þou shalt se riȝt sone porter a gile

And if I faile þe þis day euel mot I þrive
And we shul so welcome þe shyreues men

At a postern gate Gamelyn out went
And a good Cartstaf in his hondes hent
Adam hent sone anoþer grete staff
ffor to helpen Gamelyne and good strokes ȝaf
Adam felled tweyn and Gamelyn þre
þe oþer sette fete on erþe and bygan to flee
What seide Adam so euere here I masse
I haue riȝt good wyne drynk er ȝe passe


Nay by god seide þei þi drink is not goode
It wolde make a mannys brayn to lyen on his hode
Gamelyn stode stille and loked hym aboute
And seide þe Shyref commeþ wiþ a grete route
Adam seide Gamelyn what bene nowe þi redes
Here commeþ þe sheref and wil haue our hedes
Adam seide to Gamelyn my rede is now þis
Abide we no lenger lest we fare amys
I rede we to wode gon er we be founde  
Better is þer louse þan in þe toune bounde
Adam toke by þe honde yonge Gamelyn
And euery of hem dronke a drauȝt of wyn
And after token he cours and wenten her way
To fonde þe Shyrreue nyst but non aye
 The Shirreue liȝt doune and went into halle
And fonde þe lord fetred fast wiþ alle
The Schirreue vnfetred hym riȝt sone anon
And sent aftere a leche to hele his riggebon
Lat we nowe þe fals knyȝt lye in his care
And talke we of Gamelyn and of his fare
Gamelyn into þe wode stalked stille
And Adam Spensere liked riȝt ille
Adam swore to Gamelyn by seint Richere
Nowe I see it is mery to be a spencere
Ȝit leuer me were kayes to bere
Þan walken in þis wilde wode my cloþes to tere
Adam seide Gamelyn dismay þe riȝt nouȝt
Mony good mannys child in care is brouȝt
As þei stode talkinge boþen in fere
Adam herd talking of men and riȝt nygh hem þei were
Tho Gamelyn vnder wode loked ariȝt
vijxx of ȝonge men he seye wel ydiȝt
Alle satte at þe mete compas about

And whan he segh mete was glad ynogh
ffor he hoped to god to haue his dele
And he was sore alonged after a mele
As he seide þat worde þe mayster outlawe
Saugh Adam and gamelyn vnder þe wode shawe
Ȝonge men seide þe maistere by þe good rode
I am ware of gestes god sende vs goode
Ȝone ben twoo ȝonge men wel ydight  
And paraventure þer ben mo who so loked riȝt
Ariseþ vp ȝonge men and fette hem to me

Vp þer sterten vij from þe dynere
And metten wiþ Gamelyn and Adam Spencer
Whan þei were nyghe hem þan seide þat oon
Ȝeeldeþ vp ȝonge men ȝour bowes and ȝour floon
Þan seide Gamelyn þat ȝong was of elde
Moche sorowe mote þei haue þat to ȝou hem ȝelde
I Curs noon oþere but right my silue

Whan þei hard by his word þat myȝt was in his arme
Ther was noon of hem þat wold do hym harme
But seide to Gamelyn myldely and stille
Comeþ afore our Maister and seiþ to hym ȝour wille
Ȝonge men seide Gamelyn be ȝour lewte
What man is ȝour maister þat ȝe wiþ be
Alle þei answerd wiþ out lesing
Our maister is crowned of outlawe king
Adam seide Gamelyn go we in cristes name
He may neiþer mete ne drink warne vs for shame
If þat he be hende and come of gentil blood
He wil ȝeue vs mete and drink and do us som gode
By seint Iame seide Adam what harme þat I gete
I wil auenture me þat I had mete
Gamelyn and Adam went forth in fere
And þei grette þe Maister þat þei fond þere


Than seide þe Maister king of outlawes
What seche ȝe ȝonge men vnder þe wode shawes
Gamelyn answerd þe king with his croun
He most nedes walk in feeld þat may not in toun
Sire we walk not here no harme to doo
But ȝif we mete a dere to shete þerto
As men þat bene hungry and mow no mete fynde
And ben hard bystad vnder wode lynde
Of Gamelyns wordes  þe maister had reuþe  
And seide ȝe shul haue ynow haue god my treuth
He bad hem sitte doun forto take rest
And bad hem ete and drink and þat of þe best
As þei eten and dronken wel and fyne
þan seide on to anoþer þis is Gamelyn
þo was þe Maistere outlawe into counseile nome
And tolde howe it was Gamelyn þat þider was come
Anon as he herd how it was byfalle
He made him maister vnder hym ouer hem alle
WithInne þe iij weke hym come tydinge
To þe Maistere outlawe þat was her kinge
Þat he shuld come home his pees was made
And of þat good tydinge he was ful glade
þoo seide he to his ȝonge men soþ forto telle
Me bene commen tydinges I may no lenger dwelle
Tho was Gamelyn anoon wiþ out taryinge
Made maister outlawe and crowned her kinge
Whan Gamelyn was crowned king of outlawes
And walked had a while vnder þe wode shawes
þe fals knyȝt bis broþer was sherif and sire
And lete his broþere endite for hate and for ire
þoo were his boondmen sory and no þing glade
Whan Gamelyn her lord  wolfes hede was cried and made
And sent out of his men wher þei myȝt hym fynde
ffor to go seke Gamelyn vnder þe wode lynde
To telle hym tyding þe wynde was wente
And al his good reued and al his men shent


Whan þei had hym founden on knees þei hem setten
And adoune with her hodes and her lord gretten
Sir wreth ȝou not for þe good rode
ffor we han brouȝt ȝou tydyngges but þei be not gode
Nowe is þi broþer Sherreue and haþ þe bayly
And haþ endited þe  and wolfes hede doþ þe crye
Allas seide Gamelyn þat euere I was so sclak

Goþ greteþ wel myn husbondes and wif  
I wil be at þe next shyre haue god my lif
Gamelyn come redy to þe next shire
And þer was his broþer boþ lord and sire
Gamelyn boldely come into þe mote halle
And putt a doun his hode  amonge þo lordes alle
God saue ȝou lordinggs þat here be
But brokebak sherreue euel mote þou þee
Whi hast þou don me þat shame and vilonye
fforto lat endite me  and wolfeshede do me crye
þoo þouȝt þe fals knyȝt forto bene awreke
And lette Gamelyn most he no þing speke
Might þer be no grace but Gamelyn atte last
Was cast in prison and fettred fast
 Gamelyn haþ a broþere þat hiȝt sir Ote
Als good an knyght and hende as myȝt gon on fote
Anoon ȝede a massager to þat good knyȝt
And tolde him al togidere how gamelyn was diȝt
Anoon whan sir ote herd howe Gamelyn was diȝt
He was riȝt sory and no þing liȝt
And lete sadel a stede and þe way namme
And to his tweyne breþeren riȝt sone he camme
Sir seide Sir Ote to þe sherreue þoo
We bene but þre breþeren shul we neuere be mo
And þou hast prisoned þe best of vs alle
Such anoþere broþer euel mote hym byfalle
Sir Ote seide þe false knyght lat be þi cors
By god for þi wordes he shal fare þe wors


To þe kingges prison he is ynome
And þer he shal abide to þe Iustise come
Parde Seide Sir Ote better it shal be
I bid hym to maynprise þat þou graunte me
To þe next sitting of delyueraunce
And lat þan Gamelyn stonde to his chaunce
Broþere in such a forward I take hym to þe

But he be redy whan þe Iustice sitte  
þou shalt bere þe Iuggement for al þi grete witte
I graunte wel seide Sir Ote þat it so be
Lat delyuere hym anoon and take hym to me
Tho was gamelyn delyuered to Sir ote his broþer
And þat nyght dwelled þe oon wiþ þe oþer
On the morowe seide Gamelyn to Sir Ote þe hende
Broþer he seide I mote forsoþ from ȝou wende
To loke howe my ȝonge men leden her liff
Whedere þei lyuen in Ioie or ellis in striff
By god seide Sir ote þat is a colde rede
Nowe I se þat alle þe Carke shal fal on my hede
ffor whan þe Iustise sitte and þou be not yfound
I shal anoon be take and in þi stede Ibound
Broþer seide Gamelyn dismay ȝou nouȝt
ffor by seint Iame in Gales þat mony men haþ souȝt
Ȝif that god almyȝty holde my lif and witte
I wil be redy whan þe Iustice sitte
Than seide sire Ote to gamelyn god shilde þe from shame
Come whan þou seest tyme and bring vs out of blame
 Liþeneþ and listeneþ and holde ȝou stille
And ȝe shul here howe Gamelyn had al his wille
Gamelyn went vnder þe wode Ris
And fonde þer pleying ȝeng men of pris
þo was ȝong gamelyn riȝt glad ynouȝe
Whan he fonde his men vnder wode bouȝe
Gamelyn and his men talkeden in fere
And þei had good game her maister to here


His men tolde him of auentures þat þei had found
And Gamelyn tolde hem aȝein howe he was fast bounde
While Gamelyn was outlawe had he no cors
þer was no man þat for him ferde þe wors
But Abbottes and Priours monk and chanone
On hem left he nouȝt whan he myȝt hem nome
While Gamelyn and his men made merþes ryve
þe fals knyght his broþer euel mot he thryve
ffor he was fast about boþ day and oþer  
ffor to hiren þe quest to hongen his broþer
Gamelyn stode on a day and byheeld
Þe wodes and þe Shawes and þe wild feelde
He þouȝt on his broþere how he hym byhette
Þat he wold be redy whan þe Iustice sette
He þouȝt wel he wold wiþout delay
Come tofore þe Iustice to kepen his day
And saide to his ȝonge men dighteþ ȝou ȝare
ffor whan þe Iustice sitte we most be þare
ffor I am vnder borowe til þat I come
And my broþer for me to prison shal be nome
Be seint Iame seide his ȝonge men and þou rede þerto
Ordeyn how it shal be and it shal be do
While Gamelyn was commyng þer þe Iustice satte
þe fals knyȝt his broþer forȝate he not þat
To hire þe men of þe quest to hangen his broþer
þouȝe þei had not þat oon þei wold haue þat oþer
Tho come Gamelyn from vnder þe wode Ris
And brouȝt with hym ȝonge men of pris
I see wel seide Gamelyn þe Iustise is sette
Go aforn adam and loke how it spette
Adam went into þe halle and loked al aboute
He segh þer stonde lordes grete and stoute
And Sire Ote his broþer fetred ful fast
Þoo went Adam out of halle as he were agast
Adam seide to Gamelyn and to his felawes all
Sire Ote stout fetered in þe mote hall


    
     
If gode ȝeue vs grace wel forto doo
He shal it abigge þat it brouȝt þerto 
Þan seide Adam þat lockes had hore
Cristes curs mote he haue þat hym bonde so sore
And þou wilt Gamelyn do after my rede
Þer is noon in þe halle shal bere away his hede
Adam seide Gamelyn we wil not do soo
We wil slee þe giltif and lat þe oþere goo
I wil into þe halle and with þe Iustice speke  
Of hem þat bene giltif I wil ben awreke
Late no skape at þe door take ȝonge men ȝeme
ffor I wil be Iustise þis day domes to deme
God spede me þis day at my newe werk
Adam come with me for þou shalt be my clerk
His men answerde hym and bad done his best
And if þou to vs haue nede þou shalt finde vs prest
We wil stonde wiþ þe while þat we may dure
And but we worchen manly pay vs none hure
Ȝonge men said Gamelyn so mote I wel þe
A trusty maister ȝe shul fynde me
Riȝt þere þe Iustise satte in þe halle
Inne went Gamelyn amonges hem alle
Gamelyn lete vnfetter his broþer out of bende
þan seide Sir Ote his broþer þat was hende
þow haddest almost Gamelyn dwelled to longe
ffor þe quest is out on me þat I shuld honge
Broþer seide Gamelyn so god ȝeue me good rest
þis day shul þei be honged  þat ben on þe quest
And þe Iustise boþ þat is þe Iuge man
And þe Sherreue also þorgh hym it bigan
Than seide Gamelyn to þe Iustice
Now is þi power done þe most nedes rise
Þow hast ȝeuen domes þat bene euel diȝt
I wil sitten in þi sete and dressen hem ariȝt


The Iustise satte stille and roos not anone
And Gamelyn cleued his cheke bone
Gamelyn toke him in his armes and no more spake
But threwe hym ouer þe barre and his arme brake
Dorst noon to Gamelyn seie but good
ffor feerd of þe company þat without stoode
Gamelyn sette hym doun in þe Iustise sete
And Sire Ote his broþere by hym and Adam at his fete
Whan gamelyn was sette in þe Iustise sede
Herken of a bourde þat Gamelyn dede
He lete fetter þe Iustise and his fals broþere  
And did hem come to þe barre þat on with þat oþere
Whan gamelyn had þus ydone had he no rest
Til he had enquered who was on his quest
fforto demen his broþer sire Ote forto honge
Er he wist what þei were hym þouȝt ful longe
But as sone as Gamelyn wist where þei were
He did hem euerechone fetter in fere
And bringgen hem to þe barre and setten in rewe
By my feiþ seide þe Iustise þe sherrue is a shrewe
þan seide Gamelyn to þe Iustise
þou hast ȝoue domes of þe worst assise
And þe xij Sesoures þat weren on þe quest
þei shul be honged þis day so haue I good rest
Than seide þe sheref to ȝonge Gamelyn
Lord I crie þe mercie broþer art þou myn
þerfor seide Gamelyn haue þou cristes curs
ffor and þow were maister I shuld haue wors
fforto make short tale and not to longe
He ordeyned hym a quest of his men stronge
Þe Iustise and þe Sirreue boþ honged hie
To weyuen wiþ þe ropes and þe winde drye
And þe xij Sisours sorowe haue þat rekke
All þei were honged fast by þe nekke
þus endeþ þe fals knyȝt wiþ his trecherye
þat euere had lad his lif in falsnesse and folye


He was honged by þe nek and not by þe purs
þat was þe mede þat he had for his faders curs
Sire Otes was eldest and Gamelyn was ȝenge
Wenten to her frendes  and passed to þe kinge
Þei maden pees wiþ þe king of þe best sise
Þe king loued wel sir Ote and made hym iustise
And after þe king made Gamelyn in est and in west
Þe cheef Iustice of his free forest
All his wiȝt ȝonge men þe king forgaf her gilt
And siþen in good office þe king haþ hem pilt
Thus wanne Gamelyn his land and his lede
And wreke him on his enemyes  and quytte hem her mede
And Sire Ote his broþer made him his heire
And Siþen wedded gamelyn a wif good and faire
They lyued togidere þe while þat crist wold
And siþen was Gamelyn grauen vnder mold
And so shul we all may þer no man fle
God bring vs to þat Ioye þat euer shal be
Nowe frendes seide our hoost so dere
How likeþ ȝou by Iohn þe pardonere
ffor he haþ vnbokeled wel þe male
He haþ vs tolde riȝt a thrifty tale
As touching of mysgouernaunce
I prey to god ȝeue hym good chaunche
As ȝe han herd of þise retoures þre
Now gentil Marynere hertely I preye þe
Telle vs a good tale and þat riȝt anon
It shal be done by god and by seint Iohn
Seide þis marinere as wel as euer I can
And riȝt anoon his tale he bygan
A Merchaunt whilom dwelled in seynt denys
Þat riche was for which men held hym wys
A wif he had of excellent bewte
And companable and reuerent was she
Which is a þing þat causeþ more dispence
Þan worþ is al þe chere and reuerence
Þat men hem done at feestes and at daunces
such salutacions and countenaunces
Passeþ as doþ þe shadowe vpon a wall
But woo is hym þat payen mote for all
The Sely husbond algate he mot paye
He mote vs cloþe and vs aray
ffor his owne worship richely  
In which aray we dauncen Iolily
And if þat he may not perauenture
Or ellis list noon such spence endure
But þenkeþ þat it is waast and ylost
þan mote anoþer paien for þe cost
Or lene vs gold and þat is perilous
This noble marchaunt helde a noble hous
ffor which he had alday grete repayre
ffor his largesse and for his wif was faire
þat wonder is but herkeneþ to my tale
Amonge all his gestis  grete and smale
Ther was a monk a faire man and a bold
I trowe xxxti wynter he was olde
That euer in oon was drowing to þat place
þis yonge monk þat was so faire of face
  
Aqueynted was so wiþ þat good man
    
    
    
    
And eke þis monke of which I byganne
Were boþ twoo yborn in oo vilage
þe monke hym cleymed as for cosynage
And he aȝein seiþ not ones nay
But was as glad þerof as foule of day
ffor to his hert it was a grete plesance
Thus bene þei knyut wiþ eterne aliance
And eche of hem gan oþer ensure
Of breþerode þe whiles her lif may dure
ffree was dan Iohn and namely of dispence
As in þat hous and ful of diligence
To do plesaunce and also grete costage
He forȝate not to ȝeue þe lest page
In alle þat hous but after her degre
He ȝaue þe lord and siþen his Mayne
Whan þat he came some maner honest þing
ffor which þei were as glad of his commyng
As foule is fayne whan þe sonne vpriseth
No more herof as nowe for þis suffiseþ
But so byfelle þis marchaunt on a day
Shope hym to make redy his aray  
Towarde þe toune of Brugges for to fare
To byen þer a porcioun of ware
ffor which he haþ to Paris sent anōn
A massagere and preied haþ dan Iohn
þat he shuld come to seynt denys to pleyn
Wiþ hym and wiþ his wif a day or tweyn
Or he to brugges went in al wise
This noble monk of which I ȝou devise
Haþ of his abbot as hym list licence
Bycause he was a man of high prudence
  
And eke an officere out forto ride
To seen her graunges and her beernes wide
And vnto seint denys he commeþ anon
Who was so welcome as my lord dan Iohn
Our dere cosyn ful of curtesie
With him brouȝt he a Iubbe of Maluesie
And eke anoþer ful of fyne vernage
As volatile as ay was his his vsage
And þus I lat hem ete boþ drink and playe
This merchaunt and þis monk a day or twaye
The iij day þis Marchaunte vp ariseþ
And on his nede sadly hym aviseth
And vp into his counter hous goþ he
To rekne wiþ him self as wel may be
Of þilk ȝere hou þat it wiþ hym stode
And how he despended had his good
And ȝif þat he encresed were or non
His bokes and his bagges mony on
He leiþ tofore him on his countyng boord
fful riche was his tresour and his hord
ffor whiche ful fast his counter door he shette
And eke he nold þat no man shuld hym lette
Of his acomptes for þe mene tyme
And þus he sitte til it was passed prime
Dan Iohn was risen in þe morowe also
And in þe Gardyne walked to and fro
And haþ his þingges seide ful curteisly  
This good wif come walking prively
Into þe Gardyne þer he walked soft
And hym salueth as he haþ don ful oft
A mayden childe cam in her companye
Which as hure lust she may gouern and gye
ffor ȝit vndere þe ȝeerd was þe mayde
O deer Cosyn myn dan Iohn she seide
What eileþ ȝou so rathe to arise
Nece quod he it auȝt ynough suffise
  
V houres forto slepe vpon a nyȝt
But it were for an olde palled wiȝt
As ben þise wedded men þat lye and dare
As in a forme sitte a wery hare
Were al forstraught wiþ houndes grete and smale
But dere nece whi ben ȝe so pale
I trowe certes þat oure good man
Haþ ȝow labored siþ þe nyght bygan
That ȝou were nede to resten hastely
And wiþ þat word he lough ful merely
And of his owne þouȝt he wex al rede
This faire wif gan to shake her hede
And seide þus  ȝe god wote al quod she
Nay Cosin myne it stont not so wiþ me
ffor by þat god þat ȝaue me saule and lif
In all þe rewme of fraunce is þer no wif
þat lasse lust haþ to do þat sorie play
for I may syngen alas and wele away
That I was born but no wiȝt quod she
I dar not tellen how it stant wiþ me
werfore I þenk out of þis lond to wende
Or ellis of my self to make an ende
So ful I am of drede and eke of care

A saide alas nay nece god forbede

fforto ȝoure self but telleþ me ȝour greef  
Perauenture I may in ȝoure meschief
Conseile or helpe and þerfor telleþ me
Alle ȝour avis for it shal be secre
ffor on my portoos I make an oþe

Ne shal I of no counsaile ȝou bywrey

By god and by þis portoos I swere
þei men me wold al into peces tere
  
Ne shal I neuer forto goo to helle
Bywrey a word of þing þat ȝe me telle
Nouȝt for no cosinage ne alliance
But verrely for loue and affiance
Thus bene þei sworn and here vpon kist
And eche of hem told oþer what hem list
Cosyn quod she if I had a space
As I haue non namely in þis place
þan wold I tellen a legend of my lif
þat I suffred haue siþ I was a wif
With myn husbond al þough he be ȝour cosyn
Nay quod þis monke by god and by seint Martyn
He nys no more Cosyn vnto me
Þan is þis leef þat hongeþ on þe tree
I clepe hym so by seint denys in ffraunce
To haue þe more cause of aqueyntaunce
Of ȝowe þe which I haue loued specialy
Abouen al wommen sikerly

Telleþ ȝour greef lest he come adoun
And hasteþ ȝou and gooþ ȝoure way anon
My dere loue quod she o dan Iohn

But out it mote  it may no lengere bide
My husbond is to me þe worst man
þat euer was siþ þis world bygan
But siþen I am a wif it sitte not to me  
To telle no wight of our priuete
Neiþer in bedde ne in noon oþer place
God shild I shuld telle it for his grace
A wif ne shuld not seye of her husbond
But al honure as I can vnderstonde
Saue vnto ȝou þus moche telle I shal
As helpe me god he nys not worþ at al
In no degre þe valewe of a flee
But ȝit me greueþ most his nygarde
  
And wel ȝe wote þat wommen naturelly
desiren þingges sex as wel as I

Hardy and wise riche and þerto free
And boxom to his wif and fressh abedde
But by þat ilk lord þat for vs bledde
ffor his honoure my self to aray
A sonday next I mote pay
An C frankes or ellis am I lorn
Ȝit were me leuere þat I were vnborn

And if myn husbonde eke myȝt espie

Danne Iohn I seie lene me þise hundred frankes
Parde I wold not faile þe my þonkes
If þat ȝou lust to do þat I ȝou pray
ffor a certeyn day I wil ȝow pay
And to do ȝou what plesaunce and seruyse

And but I do god take on me vengeance
As foule as had genylon of ffraunce

That whan ȝoure husbonde is to fflaundres fare

But lat þis þinge be secre I ȝou prey
And god of heuene spede ȝou in ȝoure weye
And fare nowe wele myn owne cosyn dere
Graunt mercy of ȝoure cost and of ȝoure chere
  
This noble Merchaunt gentely anon
Answerde and seide O cosyn dan Iohn
Nowe sikerly þis is a smal request
My golt is ȝoures whan þat ȝou lest
And not oonly my gold but my chaffare
Take what ȝou lest god shilde þat ȝe spare
But oo þinge is ȝe knowe it wel ynogh
Of Chapmen þat her money is her plouȝe
We may creaunce while we haue a name
But goldelees forto be is no game
Paye it aȝein whan it lith in ȝoure ese
Aftere ȝoure myȝt fayn wold I ȝou plese
Thise hundred ffrankes he fette forþ anon
And priuely he toke it to dan Iohn
No wiȝt in al þis world wist of þis lone
Sauyng þis merchaunt and dan Iohn allone

Til þat dan Iohn rideþ to his abbay

To fflaundres ward his prentis wel hym gideþ
Til he came into brugges merely
Now goþ þis merchaunt fast and bisily
Aboute his nede and bieþ and creaunseþ
He neiþer pleieþ at þe dis ne daunseþ
But as a merchaunt shortely forto telle

 The sonday next þe merchaunt was agon
To seynt Denys ycommen is dan Iohn
Wiþ croune and berde fressh and newe yshaue
In al þe hous þer nas so lite a knaue  
Ne no wiȝt ellis þat he nas fayn
ffor þat my lord daun Iohn was come aȝayn
And shortely to her poynt forto gon
This faire wif acordeþ to daun Iohn
And for þise hundred frankes he shuld al nyȝt
Haue her in his armes bolt vpriȝt
  
And þis acorde perfourmed was in dede
In myrth al nyȝt a bysy lif þei lede
Til it was day þat dan Iohn went his way
And bad þe mayne fare wele and haue good day
ffor noon of hem ne no wiȝt in þe toun
Han of dan Iohn none suspecioun
And forþ he rideþ home to his abbaye
Or wher hym lust no more of hym I saie
 This marchaunt whan þat ended was þe fare
To seint Denys he gan forto repare
And wiþ his wif he makeþ feest and chere
And telleþ her þat chaffare is so dere
þat nedes most he make a cheuysance
ffor he was bounden in a reconysance
To pay xxti þousand sheldes anon
ffor which þis marchaunt is wont to gon
To borowe of certeyn frendes þat he hadde
A certeyn ffrannkes and somme with hym he ladde
And whan he was come into þe toūn
ffor greet cheerte and grete affeccioun
Vnto dan Iohn him first he goþ to pley
Nouȝt for to borowe of hym no money
But forto witt and see of his welfare
And for to tellen him of his chaffare
As frendes done whan þei ben mette in fere
Dan Iohn him makeþ feest and mery chere
And he him told aȝein ful specialy
Howe he had bouȝt ful wel and graciously
Thonked be god al hole his merchaundyse
Saue þat he most in al manere wise  
Maken a chevisaunce as for his beste
And þan shuld he be in Ioye and reste
Dan Iohn answerd Certes I am fayn

And if þat I were riche as haue I blisse
Of xxti Ml sheldes shuldest þou not mysse
  
ffor ȝe so kindely þis oþer day

But naþelees I toke vnto our dame

Vpon ȝoure benche she wote it wel certeyn
By certeyne tokens þat I can her telle
Now by ȝour leue I may no lenger dwelle

Grete wele our dame myn owene nece swete
And fare wele dere cosyn to we mete
 This Marchaunt wiþ þat was ful ware and wys
Creaunsed haþ and eke paide in Paris
To certeyn lumbardes redy in her handes

And home he goþ mery as a popeniaye

A þousand frankes aboue al his costage
His wif ful redy mette hym at þe gate
As she was wont of olde vsage algate
And all þat nyȝt in myrthe þei bysette
ffor he was riche and cleerly out of dette
 Whan it was day þis merchaunt gan enbrace
His wif al newe and kissed hir on hir face
And vp he goþe and makeþ it wonder toogh
No more quod she by god ȝe haue ynogh
And wāntonly aȝein wiþ hym she pleide
Til at þe last þat þis merchaunt seide  
By god quod he I am a litel wroth
Wiþ ȝou my wif alþo it be me loth
And wote ȝe why by god as þat I gesse
ffor ȝe haue made a manere straungenesse
Bytwixen me and my cosyn daun Iohn

By redy token and he hym held euel paide
ffor þat I to him spake of cheuysance
Me semed so as by his countenance
But naþelees by god heuen kinge

Telle me alway er þat I fro þe goo
If eny dettour haþ in myn absence

This wif was not afferd ne affraied 
Bot boldely sche seide and þat anon

O lord our lord þiname how merveilous

Of þe and of þe white lile floure

Of bounte next her sone of soules bote

To gyden vs vnto þi sonne so clere
  
My Conyng is to waike  o blesful quene
fforto declare þi grete worþinesse

But as a childe of xij monþe elde or lesse
þat can vnneþes eny word expresse
Riȝt so fare I and þerfore I ȝowe preye
Gideþ my songe þat I shal of ȝou seie
Ther was a child in a grete Cite
Amonges cristen folk in Iwerye
Susteyned by a lord of þat cuntre
ffor foule vsure and lucre of vilany
Hatful to Crist and to his companye
And þorghe þe strete men myȝt ride and wende
ffor it was fre and open at euery ende
A litel scole of Cristen folk þer stode
Doune at þe ferþer ende in which þer were
Children an hepe ycome of cristes blode
þat lerned in þat scole ȝere by ȝere
Such manere doctrine as men vsed þere
þis is to saie to syngen and to rede
As smale children done in her childhede
Amonges þise children was a widowes sone
A litel Clergioun vij ȝere of age
Þat day by day to scole was his wone
And eke also wher he segh þe ymage
Of cristes modere had he in vsage
As him was tauȝt to knele adoun and seie
His Aue marye as he goþ by þe weye
  
Thus haþ þis widowe her litel childe tauȝt
Our blesful lady cristes moder dere
To worship ay and he forgate it nouȝt
ffor sely child wil alday sone lere
But ay whan I remembre me on þis matere
Seint Nicholas stant euere in my presence  
ffor he so ȝonge to crist did reuerence
This childe his litel boke lernynge
As he satte in þe scole at his prymere
He Alma redemptoris  herd singe
As Children lered her antiphonere
And as he durst he drow hym ner and nere
And harkened ay þe wordes and þe note
Til he þe first vers couþe al by rote
Nouȝt wist he what þe latyn was to say
ffor he so ȝonge and tender was of age
But on a day his felawe gan he pray
To expoune hym þe songe in his langage
Or tellen him whi þis songe was in vsage
This preide he hym to construe and declare
fful ofte tyme vpon his knees bare
His felawe which þat elder was þan he
Answerd him þus þis songe I haue herd say
Was maked of our blisful lady fre
Her to salue and eke her forto pray
To bene our helpe and socour whan we dey
I Can no more expounde in þis matere
I lerne songe I can but smal gramere
And is þis songe ymade in Reuerence
Of Cristes modere seide þis Innocent
Now certes I wil done my diligence
To conne it er cristmas be went
  
þoo þat I for my primere shal be shent
And shal be beten þries in an houre
I wil it konne our lady to honoure
His felawe tauȝt hym homward priuely
ffro day to daye til he couþe it by rote  
And þan he songe it wel and boldely
ffro word to word acording to þe note
þrise on a day it passeþ þorgh his þrote
To scoleward and hamward whan he went
On cristes modere sette was his entent
As I haue seide þorghoute þe Iwerye
þis childe as he came to and froo
fful merely þan wold he singe and crye
On alma redemptoris euermoo
The swetnesse haþ his hert perced so
Of cristes modere þat to hir to prey
he can not stint of syngyng by þe wey
Our furst foo þe serpent Sathanas
þat haþ in Iwes his waspes nest
Vpswal and seide o Ebraike puple alas
Is þis a þing to ȝou þat his honest

In ȝoure despite and singgyng of such sentence
Which is aȝeinst ȝoure lawes reuerence
From þennes forþ þe Iwes han conspired
This Innocent out of þis world to chace
In homycide þerto han þei hured
þat in a Aley had a prive place
And as þe childe gan forby forto pace
þis cursed Iwe him hent and helde fast
And kitte his þrote and in a pitte hym cast
  
I say þat in a wardrobe þei hym drwe
Wher þat þise Iwes purgen entraile
O cursed folk of herawdes al nwe
What may ȝoure euel tent ȝou availe
Mordere wil out it wil not faile
And namely þer honure of god shuld sprede

O Matir sounded to virginite
Now maist þow syngen folowing euere in on

Of which þe grete euaungelist seynt Iohn
In Pathmos wrote which seyn þei þat gon

After this litel childe but home cam he nouȝt
ffor whom as sone as it is daies liȝt
Wiþ face pale for drede and bisy þouȝt
She haþ atte scole and ellis whe him souȝt
Til fynaly she gan so fer espie
Þat he was sene last in þe Iwerye
Wiþ moders pite in her brest enclosed
She goþ as þouȝe she were half out of mynde
To euery place wher she haþ supposed
By liklihede her child to fynde
And euere on cristes modere meke and kynde
She cried and at þe last þus she wrouȝt
Amonge þe cursed Iwes she him souȝt
She freyneþ and she preieþ pitously
To euery Iwe þat dwelte in þilk place
To telle her if her child went hem bye
þei seiden nay but Ihesus of his grace
  
ȝaue in her þouȝt inwiþ a litel space
That in þat place after her sone she cried
Ther he was cast in a pitte beside
O grete god þat perfourmed þi lawde
By mouþe of Innocence lo here þi myȝt  
This Gemme of chastite þis emeraude
And eke of Marterdom þe rubie briȝt
Ther he wiþ þrote ycorue lay vpriȝt

So longe þat al þe place gan to rynge
The Cristen folk þat þorgh þe strete went
Inne comen forto wondren on þis þinge
And hastely þei for þe prouost sent

And herieþ crist þat is of heuen kynge
And eke his modere honoure of man kynde
And after þat þe Iwes lete he bynde
This child wiþ pitous lamentacion

And wiþ honure of grete procession

Vnneþes myȝt þe puple þat was þere

Wiþ torment and with shameful deþ ilkon
This prouost doþ þise Iwes to sterue

Euel he shal haue þat euel wol deserue
þerfore wiþ wilde hors he did hym drawe
And after þat he henge him by þe lawe
  
 Vppon þis bere ay lith þis Innocent
Byforn þe chief autere whiles masse last
And after þat þe Abbot wiþ his Couent

And whan þei holy water on hym cast
Ȝit spake þe child whan spreynt was þe holy watere  
And songe O alma redemptoris matere

As monkes be or ellis ouȝten to be

And saide good child I hailse þe

Siþen þat þi þrote is kitte at my semynge

Saide þis child and as be way of ynde

But Ihesu crist as ȝe in bokes fynde
Wol þat his glorie last and be in mynde
And for þe worship of his moder dere

This welle of mecye cristes modere swete

And whan þan I my lif shuld lete
To me she cam and bad me for to singe

As ȝe han herd  and whan þat I had songe
Me þouȝt she leide a greyn vpon my tonge
Wherfore I singe and singe mote certeyn
In honure of þe blisful martere fre
Til of my tunge of taken is þe greyn
And aftere þat þus seide she to me

Whan þat þe greyn is fro þi tunge ytake
Be not agast I wil þe not forsake
This holy monke þis abbot hym mene I

And he ȝaue vp þe goost ful softely
And whan þe abbot had þis wonder seyn

And gruf he fille al plat to þe ground
And stille he lay as he had bene ybound

And after þat þei rise and forþ bene went
And toke away þis martere fro his bere
And in a toumebe of Marble stonys clere
Enclosen þei his litel body swete
Ther he is nowe god leue vs forto mete

Oure hoost segh wel þat þe briȝt sonne

And þough he were not depe expert in lore
He wist it was þe xviij day
Of Aprile þat is massagere to may
And seghe wel þat þe shadowe of euery tre
Was as in length þe same quantite
þat was þe body erecte þat caused it
And þerfore by þe shadowe he toke his witte
Þat Phebus which þat shoon so clere and briȝt
Degrees was xlv clombe on hight
And for þat day as in þat latitude  
Hit was x of þe clok he gan conclude
And sodeynly he pliȝt his hors about
Lordingges quod he I warne ȝow al þis route
þe feer party of þis day is goon
Now for þe loue of god and of seint Iohn
Leseþ no tyme as ferforþ as ȝe may
Lordingges þe tyme it wasteþ boþ nyȝt and day
And steleþ from vs what priuely slepinge
And what þourgh neglygence in our wakinge
As doþ þe streme þat turneþ neuere agayn 
Descending from þe mounteyn into playn
Wel can Senec and many a philosophre

Biheest is dette and I wil holde fayne
Al my biheest I can no better seyne

Thus wil our text but naþeles certeyne

On meters and in rymyng craftely
Haþ seide hem in such englissh as he can  
Of olde tyme as knoweþ mony a man
And if he haue nouȝt seide hem leue broþer
In oo boke he haþ seide in anoþer

Moo þan Ovide made mencioun
In his Epistels þat bene ful olde

In ȝouþe he made of Ceys and Alcione
And siþ haþ he spoke of euerychone
Thise noble wyues and þise louyers eke
Who so þat wol his large volom seke
Cleped þe Seintes legende of Cupide

Of lucresse and of Babylan Tysbe

Of ypinistra penolope Alceste

But certeynly no worde ne writeþ he
Of þilk wicke ensample of canace
Þat luffed her oune broþere synfully
Of suche cursed storis I seie fye
Or ellis of Tiro Appolloneus
How þat þe cursed king Antiocus
Biraft his douȝter of her maydenhede
Þat is so horrible a tale for to rede
Whan he her drewe þorghout þe pament  
And þerfor he of ful avisement
Nold neuer write in none of his sermons
Of such vnkinde abhomynacions
Ne I ne wil none reherce if þat I may
But of my tale how shal I done þis day

To muses þat men clepen pieriades

But naþelees I recche not a bene
Þouȝe I come after hym wiþ hawe bake

And wiþ þat word he wiþ a sobre chere

To asken help þe shamest in þine hert

And saist þou hast to litel and he haþ all

If þou be poor fare wele þi reuerence
Ȝit of þe wise man take þis sentence  
Al þe daies of poor men ben wikke
Be war þerfore er þou come in þat prikke
Ȝif þou be poor þi broþer hateþ þe
And alle þi freendes fleen fro þe alas
O riche marchauntes ful of wele be ȝe
O noble prudent folk as in þis cas
Ȝoure bagges bene not filled with ambees aas
But wiþ sise cynk þat renneþ for ȝour chance
At Cristes mas mery may ȝe daunce
  
Ȝe seken londe and ffe for ȝour wynnyngges
As wise folk þat knowen al þe state
Of regnes ȝe bene fadere of Tithenges
And tales boþen of pees and debate
I was riȝt nowe of tales desolate
Ner þat a marchaunt gone is mony a ȝere
Me taught a tale which þat ȝe shal here
In Surry whilom dwelt a companye
Of Chapmen riche and þerto sadde and trewe

Cloþes of golde and saten riche of hue
Her chaffare was so þrifty and so nwe

Wiþ hem and eke to sellen hem her ware
Nowe fille it þat þe maisters of þat sort
Han shapen hem to Rome forto wende
Were it for chapmanhode or for disport
Noon oþer massage wold þei þider sende
But commen hem self to Rome þis is þe ende
And in suche place as þouȝt hem auauntage

Soiourned han þise merchaundes in þat toun  
A certeyn tyme as fille to her plesaunce
But so byfelle þat þe excellen renoun
Of þe Emperour douȝtere Dame Castaunce
Reported was with euery circumstaunce
Vnto þise Surryen merchauntz in such wise
ffro day to day as I shal ȝou deuise
This was þe comon vois of euery man
Our Emperour of Rome god hym see
A doughter haþ þat siþe þe world bygan
To rekne as wel her goodnes as bewte
Nas neuere such anoþer as is she
I prei to god in honure hir sustene
And wolde she were of al Europe þe quene  
IN hure is hegh bewte wiþoute pride

To all her werkes vertue is her gide
Humblesse haþ sclayn in hire al tyrannye
She is a myrour of al Curtesie
Hire herte is verrey chambere of holynesse
Her hand mynystre of fredam for almesse
And al þis vois was soþ as god is trewe
But nowe to purpoos lat vs turne ageyn

And whan þei han þis blisful Maiden seyn
Howe to Surrey ben þei went ageyn
And done her nedes as þei han do ȝore
And lyuen in wele I can say ȝou no more
Now fille it þat þise marchauntes stoden in grace
Of hym þat was þe Sawden of Surrye

Make hem good chere and bysilie aspie  
Tiþingges of sondry rewmes forto lere

Amonges oþere þingges specialy
Thise marchauntes han hym tolde of dame custaunce
So grete noblesse in ernest ceriously

To han her figure in his remembraunce
And al his lust and al his bysy cure
Was forto loue her þe whilis his lif may dure
Perauenture in þe þikke large book

Wiþ sterres whan þat he his birth toke

Of sampson turuno and of Socrates

And shortly of þis matere forto pase

By cause þat þer was such dyuersite
Bytwene hor boþ lawes þat þei seyn

And alle þe cherch and all þe Chivalrye

And al his lieges shuld ycristened be
And he shal haue custance in mariage
And certeyn gold I note what quantite
And herto founden sufficient suerte
This same accorde was sworn in eiþer side  
Now faire custaunce almyȝty god þe gyde
Now wold somme men waiten as I gesse

That þe Emperour of his noblesse

Wel may men knowe þat so grete ordynaunce
May no man telle in a litel clause
As was araied for so hie a cause
Bisshopes bene shapen wiþ hure forto wende

And oþer folk ynow þis is þe ende
And notified is þorghout þe toun
  
That euery wiȝt with grete deuocioun

And to be bounden vnder subiecciōn
Of oon she knoweþ nouȝt his condiciōn

So ȝeue me grace his heestes to fulfille

And to bene vnder mannes gouernaunce

Or ylyon þat brent Thebes þat Cite

Imprudent Emperour of Rome alas

Of viage is þer non election
Namely to folk of high condicion
Nat whan a roote is of a birþ yknowe

She peyneþ hure to make good countenaunce
And forþe I lete hire saile in þis manere
And turne I wil ageyn to my matere
The modere of þe Sowden welle of vices
Espied haþ her sones pleyn entent

And riȝt anone she for her counsel sent
And þei ben commen to knowe what she ment
And whan assembled was þis folk in fere

Howe þat my sone in poynt is forto lete

But on avowe to grete god I hete

Or makametes lawe out of myn herte
What shuld vs tyden of þis newe lawe
But þraldome to our bodies and penaunce  
And afterward in helle to ben drawe
ffor we reveied Mahonne our creaunce
But lordes wil ȝe maken assurance
As I shal sein assenting to my lore
And I shal make vs sauf for euermore
 Thei sworen and assenten euery man
To lyve and dye wiþ hure and by hure stonde
And euery in þe best wise he can
To strengthen hure shal al his freendes fonde
And she haþ þis emprise taken on honde
Which ȝe shal here þat I shal devise
And to hem alle she spak in þis wise
  
We shul first feyn vs cristendom to take
Cold watere shal not greue vs but a lite
And I shal suche a reuel and feest make

She shal haue nede to wassh awaye þe rede

O Sawdenesse Roote of Iniquite

Like to þe Serpent depe in helle ybound
O feyned womman al þat may confound

O Sathan envious siþ þilk day

Wel knewest þou to wommen þe old way

Thow wilt fordone cristen mariage
Thyn Instrument so wele away þe while
Makestowe of wommen wham þou wilt begile  
This Sowdonesse whom I þus blame and warye
Lat prively her counsel gone her way
What shuld I in þis tale lenger tarye
She rideþ to þe Sawden on a daye
And seide him þat she wold reneye her laye
And Cristendom of preestes hondes fonge
Repenting she heþen was so longe
Biseching him to done her þat honoure

To plesen hem I wil do my labour

And knelinge þonkeþ hure of þat request
So glad he was he nyst what to seye
She kist her sone and hom she goþ her way
Arriued bene þise cristen folk to londe
In Surrye wiþ a grete solempne Route
And hastely þis Sowden sent his sonde

And seide his wiff was commen out of doute
And preide hure forto riden ageyn þe quene

Of Surriens and romaynes met yfere

Resceyueþ her wiþ as glad a chere
As eny modere myȝt her douȝter dere
And to þe next Cite þer beside
A soft paas solempnely þei ryde
Naught trowe I þe triumphe of Iulius
Of which þat lucan makeþ such a boost
Was ryallere ne more curious  
Than was þe assemple of þis blisful hoost
But þis scorpion þis wikke goost

Cast vnder þis ful mortally to stynge
The Sowden commeþ hym self sone after þis
So Rialli þat wonder is to telle
He welcommeþ hure with alle ioye and blis
And þus in merþe and Ioie I lete hem dwelle

And to þe fest cristen folk hem dresse

And deyntes moo þan I can ȝou devise
But al to dere þei bouȝt it er þei rise
O sodeyn woo þat euer art successoure
To worldly blisse spayned is wiþ bitternesse

Woo occupieþ þe fyne of our gladnesse
Herk þis counsaille for þi sikernesse

For shortely forto tellen at oon word

But it were oonly dame custance allone

NE þer nas Surrien noon þat was conuerted

And Custaunce han þei take anon fote hoot
And in a shippe al steerless god woote

A certeyn tresour þat she þider ladde
And soþe to seyn vitaile grete plente

And fforþ she sailleþ in þe salt see

That wessh þe world from þe olde iniquyte

Victorious tree protection of trewe
That oonly worþi were for to bere

On which þi lyues feiþfully extenden

Thorghout þe see of Grece vnto þe strayte
Of Marrok as it was hir aventure  
O mony a sory mele nowe may she baite
After her deth ful oft may she wayte
Er þat þe wilde wawes wil her dryve
Vnto þe place þere she shal aryue
MEn myghten axen whi she was not sclayn

I Answere to þat demannde agayn
Who saued Danyel in þe horrible caue
  
Ther euery wiȝt saf he maister or knaue

No wight but god þat hem bare in his hert
GOd list to shewe his wonderful myracle
In hir þat shee shulde seen his myȝty werkes

By certayne meenes oft  as knowen clerkes
Doþ þing for certeyn ende þat ful derk es
To mannys witt þat for our ignoraunce
Ne kon not knowe his prudent puruyaunce
Now siþ she was not at þe feest ysclawe
Who kepte her from þe drenching in þe see
Who kepte Ionas in þe fisshes mawe
Til he was spowted vp at Nynyve
Wel may men knowe it was no wiȝt but he
What kept puple Ebrayk from drenchinge
Wiþ drie feet þorgh out þe see passinge
Who bad þe foure spiretes of tempest
That power han boþ annoyen londe and see
Boþ norþe and souþe and also west and Eest
Annoyeþ neiþer See londe ne tree
Soþly þe Comannder of þat was he
That from þe tempest ay þis womman kept
As wel whan she woke as whan she sclepte  
Where myȝt þis womman mete or drynk haue
Thre ȝere or more how lasteþ hir vitaille
Who fedde þe Egipcien mary in þe Caue
Or in desert noon but Crist saunz faille
V Ml folk it was as grete mervaille
Wiþ loues v and fisshes two to fede

She dryueþ forþ into our Occiān
Thorghout oure wilde See to atte last
Vnder an hold þat nempne I ne can
ffor in Nourth humberlond þe wawe hire cast
And in þe sonde her shipp stiked so fast

The wille of Crist was þat she shuld abide
The Constable of þe Castel doun is fare
To seen þis werk and al þe ship he souȝt
And fonde þis wery womman ful of care
He fonde also þe tresoure þat she brouȝt
In her langage mercy she bysouȝt
The lif out of her body forto twynne
Hire to delyuere of woo þat she was Inne
A Maner latyn corrupte was her speche
But algates þerby was she vnderstonde
The Constable whan he list no lengere seche
This wooful womman brouȝt he to þe londe
She kneleþ doune and þonkeþ goddys sonde
But what she was she wolde no man seye
ffor foule ne faire þouȝe þat she shuld deye
She seide she was so mased in the See
þat she forgate hure mynde by hure trouþe
The Constable of hire haþ so grete pite  
And eke his wiff þat þei wepen for rouþe
She was so diligent wiþouten slouþe
To serue and plese euerech in þat place
That al her louen þat loken on her face 
The Constable and dame Ermengeld his wiff
Were paynymes and þat contray euerywhere
But Hermengilt loued hure riȝt as hir liff
And Constance haþ so longe soiourned þere
  
In Orisons wiþ mony a bitter tere
Til Ihesu haþe conuerted þorgh his grace
Dame hermengild Constablesse of þat place
In all þat londe durst none cristen route
Alle Cristen folk ben fledd fro þat cuntre
Thorgh paynymes þat conquered þer aboute
þe plages of þe north by lond and see
To wales fledde þe Cristiante
Of olde Bretoynes dwellin in þe Ile
Ther was hure refute for þe mene while
But ȝit nas neuere cristen Bretoyne so exiled
That þer nas somme in her priuetee
Honoured Crist and heþen folk begyled
And nyȝe þe Castel such þer dwelled thre
That oon of hem was blynde and myȝt not see
But it were wiþ þilk yen of his mynde
With which men seen after þat þei bene blynd
Briȝt was þe sonne as in þat somers day
ffor whiche þe constable and his wif also
And Custance han ytake þe riȝt way
Toward þe see a forlonge way or two
To pleien and to romen to and froo 
And in her walk þis blynde man þei mette
Croked and olde wiþ fast eyen yshett  
In þe name of crist cried þis blynd Bretoun
Dame hermegild ȝeue me siȝt agayn
This lady wexe afraied of þe soune
Lest þat her husbond shortely forto seyne
Wold hure for Ihesu cristes loue haue slayn
Til Custance made hure bold and bad hire wirche
The wille of crist as douȝter of his chirche
  
The constable wexe abasshed of þat sight
And seide what amounteþ al þis fare
Custance answerd Sire it is cristes myȝt
Þat helpeþ folk out of þe fendes snare
And so ferforþ she can our lay declare
þat she þe constable er it was eve
Conuerteþ and on crist made hym byleue
This Constable nas no þing lord of þis place
Of which I speke þer he Custaunce fonde
But kepte it strongly mony a wynter space
Vnder Alla king of all Norþhumberlonde
þat was full wise and worþi of his honde
Ageyne þe scottes as men may wel here
But turne I wil ageyn to my matere
Sathan þat euere vs waiteþ to begile
Seghe of Custance al hure perfeccioun
And cast anone howe he myȝt quyte her while
And made a yonge knyght þat dwelt in þe toun
Loue hire so hoot of foule affeccioun
Þat verrely hym þouȝt he shulde spille
But he of hire ones myȝt haue his wille
He woweþ hure but it availleþ nouȝt
She wolde do no synne by no weye
And for despite he compased in his þouȝt  
To make hure a shameful deeþ to dye
He waiteþ whan þe constable was away
And priuely vpon a nyȝt he crept
In hermengildes Chambre while she slept
Wery forwaked in her Orisons
Slepeþ Custance and hermengild also 
This knyght þourgh Sathanas temptacions
Al softly is to þe bed ygoo
  
And kitte þe þrote of hermengild atwoo
And laide þe blody knyf by dame Custaunce
And went his waye þer god ȝeue hym meschaunce
Sone after Commeþ þis Constable home agayn
And Eke Alla þat kinge was of þat londe
And segh his wiff dispitously slayn
ffor whiche ful oft he wepte and wronge his honde
And in þe bedde þe blody knyf he fonde
By dame Custaunce allas what myȝt she say
ffor verry woo her witte was al away
So kinge Alla was tolde al þis meschaunce
And eke þe tyme and where and in what wise
þat in a shipp was founden þis Custaunce
As here byforn ȝe han herde devise
The kingges hert of pite gan agrise
Whan he seye so benigne a creature
ffalle in dissese and in mysauenture
For as þe lombe toward þe deth is brouȝt
So þis Innocent stant tofore þe king
Þis fals knyȝt þat haþ þis treson wrouȝt
Bereþ hure on honde þat she haþ do þis þing
But naþelees þer was grete mournyng
Amonge þe puple and seie þai can not gesse
Tha she had done so grete a wickednesse  
For þei han seyn her euere so vertuous
And louyng hermengile riȝt as her liff
Of þis bare witnesse euerich in þat hous
Saue he þat hermengild slowe with his knyff
This gentile kinge haþ kauȝt a gret motiff
Of þis witnesse and þouȝt he wold enquere
Depper in þis caas trouþe forto lere
  
Allas Custance þow nast no champyon
Ne fighte Canstowe nat so wele away
But he þat for oure redempcion
And bonde Sathan and lyeþ hym þer he lay
So be þi strong Champion þis daye
ffor but Criste on þe miracle kith
Wiþowten gilt þou shalt be slayn as swiþe
She sette her doune on knees and þer she seide
Immortal god þat sauedest Susanne
ffro fals blame and þou merciful maide
Marye I mene douȝter to seint Anne
Byforn whoos childe aungels sing Osanne
If I be giltlees of þis felonye
My socoure be for ellis shal I dye
Haue ȝe not sene somtyme a pale face
Among a prees of him þat haþ be ladde
Toward þe deþe where as he gete no grace
And swich a coloure in his face haþ hadde
Men myȝt knowe his face þat was bistadde
Amonge alle þe faces of þat route
So stant Custance and lokeþ hire aboute
O quenes lyuynge in prosperite
Duchesses and ȝe ladies euerechone
Haue some rouþe on her aduersite  
An Emperours douȝtere stant allone
She haþ no wiȝt to whom to make her mone
O blood real þat stondest in þis drede
ffer bene þi frendes at þi grete nede
This Alla king haþ swich compassioun
As Geltile hert is fulfilled of pite
þat from his eyen ranne þe water doun
Now hasteli do fecche a boke quod he
  
And if þis knyght wil swere howe þat she
þis womman sclowe ȝit wil we vs avise
Whom þat we wold shuld be our Iustise
A breton booke writen with euaungelies
Was fette and þeron he swore anone
She giltif was in þe mene whiles
An honde him smote vpon þe nekke bone
þat doune he felle at ones as a stone
And boþe his eyen brast out of his face
In siȝt of euery body in þat place
A voys was herde in general audience
And seide þou hast disslaundered giltelees
þe douȝter of holy church in high presence
Thus hastowe done and ȝit I mot hold my pees
Of þis mervaile agast was all þe prees
As mazed folk þei stoden euerechone
ffor drede of wreche sauf Custance alone
Grete was þe drede and eke þe repentaunce
Of hem þat hadden wrong suspecioun
Vppon þis cely Innocent Custaunce
And for þis miracle in conclusioun
And by Custance Mediacioun
Þe kinge and mony anoþer in þat place
Conuerted were þonked be goddis grace  
This fals knyght was sclayn for his vntrouþe
By Iuggement of Alla hastifly
And ȝit Custance haþ of his deþ gret rouþe
And after þis Ihesus of his mercye
Made Alla wedden ful solempnely
This holy maiden þat is so briȝt and shene
And þus haþ crist made Custance a quene
  
But who was wooful if I shal not lye
Of þis wedding but donegild and no moo 
The kingges modere ful of Tyrannye
Hire þouȝt her cursed hert brast a two
She wold not her sone had done so 
Hire þouȝt a despite þat he shulde take
So straunge a creature vnto his make
ME list not of þe Chaf ne of þe stre
Make so longe a tale as of þe corne
What shuld I tellen of þe Rialte
Of mariage or which cours goþ byforne
Who bloweþ in trompe or in an horne
þe ffrwte of euery tale is forto seye
þe and drinke  þei daunce singe or pley 
Thei gone to bedde as it was skil and riȝt
ffor þouȝe þat wives bene ful holy þingges
þei most take in pacience a nyght
Such manere necessaries as ben plesingges
To folk þat han ywedded hem with ringges 
And laye a litel her holynesse aside
As for þe tyme it may none oþere betide
On hire he gate a knaue child anone
And to a bisshope and his Constable eke
He toke his wif to kepe whan he is gone  
to scotlond ward his foomen for to seke
Nowe faire Custance þat is so humble and meke
So longe is goon wiþ child til þat stille
She halt her chambere abiding cristes wille
The tyme is come a knaue child she bere
Mauricius atte fontstone þei hym calle
þis Constable doþ forþ come a massagere
And wrote to his kinge þat cleped was Alle
  
Howe þat þis blisful tydyngges is byfalle
And oþer tydingges spedeful forto seye
He takeþ þe lettre and forþ he goþ his waye
This Massagere to done his auauntage
Vnto þe kingges modere rideþ swiþe
And salweþ hire ful faire in his langage
Madame quod he  ȝe may be glad and bliþe
And þonkeþ god an hundred þousand siþe
My lady quene haþ child wiþouten doute
To Ioie and blisse of al þis regne aboute
Lo here þe lettres seled of þis þinge
Þat I mot bere wiþ al þe hast I may
If ȝe wil ouȝt vnto ȝoure sone þe kinge
I am ȝoure seruaunte boþ nyȝt and day
Dongild answerd not not at þis tyme
But here al nyȝt I wil þou take þi rest
To morowe wil I saye what me lest
This Massagere dronk sadly ale and wyne
And stollen were his lettres prively
Out of his boxe whilst he slepte as a swyn
And counterfeted was ful subtily
A noþere lettre wrouȝt ful synfully
Vnto þe kinge directe of þis matere
ffrom his Constable as ȝe shal after here  
The lettre spak þe Quene delyuered was
Of so horrible a fendlich creature
That in þe Castel noon so hardy was
þat eny while dorst þerInne endure
The modere was an Elf by auenture
Ycome by Charmes or by sorcerye
And euery wight hateþ her companye
  
WOo was þis kinge whan he þis lettre had seyne
But to no wiȝt he tolde his sorowes sore
But of his owne honde he wrote ageyne
Welcome þe sonde of crist for euermoore
To me þat am nowe lered in his lore
Lord welcome be þi lust and þi plesaunce
My lust is putte al in þine ordynaunce
Wepeþ þis child al be it foule or feire
And eke my wiff vnto myn home commynge
Crist whan him list may sende me an heire
More agreable þan þis is to my likinge
This letter he celeþ prively wepinge
Whiche to þe massagere was take sone
And forþ he goþ þer nys no more to done
O Massagere fulfilled of dronkenesse
Stronge is þi breeþ þi lymmes flateren ay
And þou bywreiest al sikernesse
Thy mynde is lorn þou Iangelest as a Iaye
Thi face is turned in a newe aray
Ther dronkenesse regneþ in ony route
Ther nys no counsell hidde wiþoute doute
O Donegild I ne haue noon englissh digne
Vnto þi malice and þi tyrannye  
And þerfore to þe fende I þe resigne
Lat hym enditen of þi traterye
ffy mannyssh fy o nay by god I lie
ffy feendissh spirit  for I dar wel telle
Thowe þou here walk þi spirit is in helle
This massagere commeþ fro þe feende agayn
And at þe kingges moders court he liȝt
And she was of this massagere ful fayn
And plesed him in al þat euere she myȝt
  
He drank wel his girdel vnder piȝt
He sclepeþ and he ffronteþ in his gise
Al nyght to þe sonne gan arise
Ofte were his lettres stolle euerechone
And counterfeted lettres in þat wise
Þe kinge commaundeþ his constable anone
Vp peyn of hongyng on an high Iwyse
That he ne shulde suffre in no wise
Custance wiþInne his regne forto abide
Thre daies and a quarter of a tyde
But in þe same ship as he hire fonde
Hure and her yonge sone and al her gere
He shulde putte and croude fro þe londe
And charge hure þat she neuere eft come þere
O my Custance wel may þi goost haue fere
And sleping in þi dreme bene in penaunce
Whan donegil cast all hir ordinaunce
This Massagere on morowe whan he woke
Vnto þe Castel halt þe next waye
And to þe Constable he þe lettre toke
And whan þat he þis pitous lettre saye
fful oft he seide allas and walawaye
lord Crist quod he howe may þis lettre endure  
So ful of synne is mony a creature
O myȝty god if þat it be þi wille
Siþ þou art riȝtful Iuge how may it be
þat þou wilt suffren Innocentz to spille
And wicked folk regnen in prosperite
O good Custance allas so woo is me
þat I mote be þi turmentour or deye
On shames deth þer nys noon oþere waye
  
Wepen boþ ȝonge and olde in al þat place
Whan þat þe kinge þis cursed lettre sent
And Custance wiþ a dedly pale face
þe ferþe day toward her ship she went
But naþelees she takeþ in good entent
þe wille of Crist and kneling in þe stronde
She saide lorde o welcome be þi sonde
He þat me kept from þe fals blame
While I was in þe londe amonges ȝou
He kan me kepe from harme and eke fro sham
In salt See alþouȝe I se not howe
As stronge as euer he was he is riȝt nowe
In hym trust I and in his modere dere
þat is to me my saille and eke my stere
Hire litel child lay weping in her Arme
An kneling pitously to him she seide
Pees litel sone I wil do þe noon harme
Wiþ þat her keerchef of her hede she breide
And ouer his smale yen she it leyde
And in her Arme she lulleþ it ful fast
And in to heuene her yen vp she cast
Modere quod she and maide briȝt marie
Soþe is þat þorowe wommennys eggement  
Mankinde was lorn and dampned ay to dye
ffor which þi child was on croys yrent
þi blisful eyen segh al his turment
þan is þer no comparison bytwene
þi woo and any woo man may sustene
Thowe seghe þi sone yslayn bifore þine eyen
And ȝit now lyueþ my litel child parfay
Now lady briȝt to whoom al woful crien
Thowe glory of wommanhode þou faire may
  
þow hauen of refute briȝt sterre of day
Rewe on my child þat of þi gentilnesse
Rewest on euery Rwefull in distresse
O litel child allas wat is þi gilt
þat neuer wrouȝtest synne as ȝit parde
Why wil þine harde fadere haue þe spilt
O mercye dere constable quod she
As lat my litel child dwelle here with þe
And ȝif þou darst not fauour hym for blame
So kisse him onys in his faders name
Therwiþ she lokeþ bacward to þe lande
And saide fare wel husbond rewthlees
And vp she rest and walkeþ doun þe stronde
Toward þe shippe hire foloweþ al þe prees
And euere she preieþ her child to hold his pees
And takeþ her leue and with an holy entent
She blesseþ hire and into ship she went
Availed was þe ship it is no drede
Abundantly for hire a longe space
And oþer necessaries þat shulde nede
She had ynowe heryed be goddes grace
ffor wynde and weder almyȝty god purchase
And bringe hure home I can no better seye  
But in þe See she driveþ forþ her weye
Alla þe kynge commeþ home sone after þis
Vnto his Castel of þe which I tolde
And axeþ wher his wif and his child is
The Constable gan about his hert cold
  
And pleynly al þe manere he hym told
As ȝe han herde I can telle it no bettere
And sheweþ þe kinge his seele and his lettere
And seide lord as ȝe commaunded me
Vp peyn of deþe so haue I done certeyne
This massagere tormented was til he
Most beknowen and tellen plat and pleyne
ffrom nyght to nyȝt in what place he had leyne
And þus by witte and subtil enqueringe
Ymagened was by whom þis harme can sprynge
The honde was knowen þat þe lettere wrote
And al þe venyme of þis cursed dede
But in what wise certeynly I note
þe effecte is þis þat Alla out of drede
his modere sclowe þat mony men pleynly rede
That for she tratour was to her legeaunce
Thus endeþ old donegild with meschaunce
The Sorowe þat þis Alla nyȝt and day
Makeþ for his wif and for his child also
Ther nys no tunge þat it telle may
But now wil I vnto Custance goo
That fleteþ in þe See in peyn and woo
V ȝere and more as liked cristes sonde
Er þat her shippe approched vnto londe
Vnder an hethen Castell atte last
Of which þe name in my tixt noȝt I fynde  
Custance and eke þe child þe see vp cast
Almyȝty god þat saueþ al man kinde
Haue on custaunce and her childe som mynde
þat fallen is in hethen hand eft sone
In poynt to spille as I shal telle ȝou sone
  
Downe fro þe Castell comþe þere mony a wiȝt
To gawen on þis ship and on custance
But shortely from þe Castel on a nyȝt
The lordes steward god ȝeue hym meschaunce
A theef þat had reyned our creaunce
Come into shipp allone and seide he shuld
Her lemman be where so she wold or nold
Woo was þis wrecched womman þoo bygone
Her childe cried and she cried pitously
But blisful mary halpe hure riȝt anone
ffor wiþ her strogelinge wel and myȝtely
þe theef fille ouer bord al sodeynly
And in þe See he dreynt for vengeance
And þus haþ crist vnwemmed kepte custance
O foule lust of luxurie lo þine ende
Not only þat þou fayntest mannys mynde
But verrely þou wilt his body shende
þe ende of þi werk or of þi lustes blynde
Is compleynyng how mony one may men fynde
þat nouȝt for werk somtyme but for þentente
To done þis synne bene eiþer slayn or shente
How may þis weike womman han þis strength
Hire to defend aȝeinst þis Renegat
O Golyas vnmesurable of length
How myȝt dauid make þe so mat
So yonge and of armure so desolat
How durst he loke vpon þi dredful face  
Wel may men seen it was but goddes grace
Who ȝaf Iudith corage or hardynesse
To scleen hym Olesphernus in his tent
And to delyuere out of wrecchednesse
The puple of god I seye for þis entent
  
That riȝt as god spirit and vigor sent
To hem and saued hem out of meschaunce
So sent he myȝt and vigor to Custaunce
Forþ goþ þe shippe þoroweout þe narow mouþe
Of Iubaltar and scepte dryuyng aye
Som tyme west and somtyme nourþe and souþe
And somtyme Este ful mony a wery daye
Til Cristes modere blessed be ȝe aye
haþ scapen þorgh her endelees goodnesse
To make an ende of al her hevynesse
Now lat vs stynt of Custance but a throwe
And speke we of þe Romayn Emperour
þat out of Surry haþ by letters knowe
þe sclaughter of Cristen folk and dishonoure
Doon to his douȝter by a fals tratour
I mene þe Cursed wicked Sowdenesse
That at þe feest lete scleen boþ more and lesse
For which þe Emperour haþ sent anon
His Senatour wiþ real ordynaunce
And oþer lordes god wote mony on
On Surriens to taken hie vengeaunce
They brennen sleen and bringgen hem to meschaunce
fful mony a day but shortely þis is þende
Homword to Rome þei shapen hem to wende
This senatour repaireþ with victorye
To Romeward saillinge ful Rially  
And mette þe Shippe dryuyng as seiþ þe storye
In which Custance sitte ful pitously
No þing ne knewe what she was ne why
She was in such aray  ne she nyl sey
Of her astaat þough þat she shulde deye
  
HE bringeþ her to Rome and to his wiff
He ȝaue hure and her ȝonge sone also
And wiþ þe Senatoure she lad her liff
Thus can our lady bringen out of woo
Wooful Custance and mony an oþer moo
And longe tyme dwelled she in þat place
In holy werkes euer as was hire grace
The Senatours wif her Aunte was
But for al þat she knewe her neuere þe more
I wil no lenger tarien in þis cas
But to kinge Alla which I spake of yore
Þat for his wiff wepeþ and sigheþ sore
I wil retorne and lete I wil Custance
Vnder þe Senatours gouernaunce
Kynge Alla which þat had his modere sclayn
Vpon a day felle in such repentaunce
þat if I shortely tellen shal and playn
To Rome he commeþ to resceyuen his penance
And putte him in þe Popes ordinance
In by and lowe and Ihesu crist bysouȝt
fforȝeue his wicked werkes þat he wrouȝt
The fame anon þorowe Room toune is born
How Alla þe king shal commen in pilgrimage
By herberiours þat wenten hym biforn
ffor which þe Senatoure as was vsage
Rode hym aȝein and mony of his lynage
As wel to shewen his hie magnificence  
As to doon eny king a Reuerence
Grete chere doþ þis noble Senatour
To kinge Alla and he to hym also
Euerech of hem doþ oþere grete honour
And so byfelle þat in a day or twoo
  
This Senatour is to king Alla goo 
To feest and shortely if I shal not ly
Custance sone in his Companye
Somme men wold seyn atte request of Custance
This Senatour haþ ladde þis child to fest
I may not tellen euery Circumstance
Be as be may þer was he atte leest
But soþe is þis þat at his moders hest
Byforn alla duringe þe metes space
The Childe stode loking in þe kingges face
This Alla kinge haþ of þe child gret wonder
And to þe Senatoure he seide anoon
Whoos is þat faire childe þat stondeþ ȝonder
I noot quod he by god and be seynt Iohn
A modere he haþ but fadere haþ he non
þat I of wote and shortly in a stounde
He told Alla how þat þis child was founde
But god wote quod þis Senatour also
So vertuous a lyuere in my liff
Ne segh I neuere as she ne herd of mo
Of worldly wommen  mayde ne wiff
I dar wel seide she had leuer a knyff
þoroweout her brest þan bene a womman wicke
þer is no man couþe bringe hire to þat prikke
Now was þis Childe as like vnto custance
As possible is a creature to be  
This Alla haþ þe face in remembrance
Of Dame Custance and þeron mused he
If þat þe childes modere were ouȝt she
þat is his wif and priuely he siȝt
And spedde hym fro þe table þat he myȝt
  
Perfay he þouȝt þe fantom is in myn hede
I ouȝt demen of skilful Iuggement
That in þe salt se my wif is dede
And afterward he made his argument
What wote I ȝif þat crist haþ hider sent
My wiff by see as wel as he her sent
To my cuntre from þennes as she was went
And aftere anoon home wiþ þe Senatoure
Goþ alla forto see þis wonder chance
This Senatour doþ Alla grete honoure
And hastifly he sent aftere Custance
But trusteþ wel her lust nouȝt to dance
Whan þat she wist wherfor was þat sonde
Vnneþes on her fete she myȝt stonde
Whan Alla segh his wif faire he her grette
And wepte it was reuþe forto see
ffor atte first loke he on hir sette
He knewe wel verrely þat it was she
And for sorowe as dombe stant as a tre
So was hert shette in her distresse
Whan she remembred his vnkindenesse
Twise she swowneþ in his owne siȝt
He wepte and him excuseþ pitously
Nowe god quod he and his halowes briȝt
So wisly on my soule haue mercy
þat of ȝoure harme as giltelees am I
As is Maurice Mi sone so lik ȝoure face  
Ellis þe feend me fecche out of þis place
Longe was þe sobbyng and þe bitter peyne
Er þat her wooful hertes myȝten cese
Grete was þe pite forto here hem pleyne
þorgh whiche pleyntes gan her woo encrees
  
I prei ȝou all my labour to relees
I may not tellen her woo vntil to morowe
I am so wery to speke of her sorowe
But fynaly whan þat þe soþe is wist
That Alla giltlees was of her woo
I trowe an C tymes ben þei kist
And suche a blisse is þer ytwix hem twoo
þat saue þe Ioie þat lesteþ euermoo
þer is non like þat eny creature
Haþ seyne or shal while þe world may dure
Tho preied she her husbond mekely
In relief of her longe pitous pyne
þat he wolde prei hure fadere specialy
þat of his maieste he wold enclyne
To vouche sauf with him som day to dyne
She preied him eke he shulde by no way
vnto her fader no word of hire say
Somme men wold seyn how þat þe childe Maurice
Doþ þis massage vnto þe Emperour
But as I gesse alla was not so nyce
To him þat was of so souereyn honour
As he þat is of cristen folk þe flour
Sent eny childe but it is bette to deme
He went him self and so it may wel seme
This Emperour haþ graunted gentilly
To come to dyner as he hym bysouȝt  
And wel rede I he loked bisily
Vpon þis child and on his douȝter þouȝt
Alla goþ to his Inne and as hym ouȝt
Arraied for þis feest in euery wise
As ferforþ as his conyng may suffice
  
The morowe come and Alla can hym dresse
And eke his wif þis emperour forto mete
And forþ þei ride in Ioie and in gladnesse
And whan she segh her fadere in þe strete
She liȝt adoune and falleþ hym to fete
ffadere quod she ȝoure ȝonge child Custance
Is nowe ful clene out of ȝoure remembrance
I am ȝoure douȝtere Custance quod she
þat whilom ȝe sent vnto Surray
It am I fadere þat in þe salt see
Was putte allone and dampned forto dye
Good fader now I yow mercye crye
Send me no more vnto noon heþenes
But þonke my lord here of his kindenes
Who can þe pitous Ioye tellen alle
Bitwixe hem þre siþ þei ben þus ymette
But of my tale make an ende I shal
The day goþ fast I wil no lenger lette
This glad folk to dyner þei hem sette
In Ioye and blisse at mete I lat hem dwelle
A þousand fold wel more þan I can telle
This child Maurice was siþen Emperour
Made by þe pope and lyued cristenly
To cristes churche he did grete honour
But I lat al þis story passen by
Of Custance is my tale specialy
In olde romayn Gestes may men fynde  
Mawrices lif I bere it not in mynde
This king Alla whan he his tyme say
Wiþ Custance his holy wif so swete
To Engelond ben þei come þe riȝt way
Wher as þei lyve in Ioie and in quiete
  
But litel while it lasteþ I ȝou hete
Ioie of þis world for tyme wil not abide
ffrom day to nyȝt it chaungeþ as þe tyde
Who lyued euere in suche delite a day
Þat ne meued eiþer conscience
Or Ire or talent or somkyn affray
Envie or pride or passion or offence
I ne seie but for þis ende þis sentence
Þat litel while in Ioye or in plesaunce
Lasteþ þe blisse of alla wiþ Custaunce
For deþ þat takeþ of high and lough his rente
Whan passed was a ȝeer euene as I gesse
Out of þis world þis kinge alla he hente
ffor whoom Custance haþ ful grete hevynesse
Now lat vs preien god his saule blisse
And Dame Custance fynally to seye
Toward þe towne of Rome goþ her weye
TO Rome is come þis holy creature
And fyndeþ her frende hool and sound
Now is she scaped all hure auenture
And whan she her fadere haþ yfounde
Doune on her knees falleþ she to grounde
Weping for tendernesse in hert blith
She herieþ God an C thousand siþe
In vertue and holy Almesdede
þei lyuen all and neuere a sondrie wende  
Til deþ departe hem þis lif þei lede
And fareþ now wel my tale is at an ende
Now Ihesu crist þat of his myȝt may sende
Ioye after woo gouerne vs in his grace
And kepe vs all þat ben in þis place
Oure hoost vpon his stiropes stood anon
And seide good men herkeneþ euerychon
This was a þrifty tale for þe nones
Sire parissh preest quod he for goddes bonys
Telle vs a tale as was þi forward yore
I se wele pat ȝe leerned men in lore
Can moche good by goddes dignyte
þe Parsone hym answered benedicite
What eileþ þe man so synfully to swere
Oure hoost answerd O Iankyn be ȝe þere
I smelle a lollard in þe wynde quod he
Howe good men quod our hoost herkneþ me
Abideþ for goddis digne passion
ffor we shal haue a predicacion
þis lollard here wil prechen vs somwhat
Nay by my fader soule þat shal he nat
Seide þe Sqwier here shal he nat preche
He shal no gospel glosen here ne teche
He leueþ al in þe grete god he
He wolde sowen som difficulte
Or springell Cokel in oure clene corn
And þerfore hoost I warne þe byforn
Mi Ioly body shal a tale telle
And I shal Clynken ȝou so mery a belle
Þat I shal waken al þis companye
But it shal not bene of Philosophie
Ne Phislyas ne teermes queynt of lawe
Þer is but litel latyn in my mawe
At Sarray in þe land of Tartarye
þer dwelt a kyng þat werried Russye
þorgh which þer deyed mony a dughty man
þis noble king was cleped Cambynskan
Which in his tyme was of so grete renoun
þat þer nas nowhere in no regioun
So Excellent a lord in al þinge
Hym lacked nouȝt þat longed to a kynge
As of þe secte of which þat he was born
He kepte his lay to which þat he was sworn
And þerto he was hardy wise and riche
And pitous and Iust alway ylich
Sooþ of his worde benygne and honurable
Of his corage as ony centre stable
ȝong fresshe and stronge in Armes desirous
As eny bachilere in al his hous
A faire persone he was and fortunat
And kept alway so wel rial astat
þat þer nas nawhere such a noþer man
This noble kinge þis tartre Cambynskan
had two sones on Eltheta his wiff
Of which þe eldest hight Algarsiff
þat oþer was cleped Camballo
A doughtere had þis worþi kinge also
þat ȝongest was and hiȝt Canace
But forto telle ȝou al her beute
It liþe not in my tunge ne in my connynge
I dar not vndertake so hye a þinge
  
Myn engelissh eke is insufficient
It most bene a ritther excellent
þat kouþe his colours longyng for þat arte
If he shuld here discryve eny part
I am noon suche I most speke as I can
And so byfelle þat þis Cambynskan
Hath xxti wyntere born his diademe  
As he was wonte fro ȝere to ȝere I deme
He lete þe feest of his natiuite
Done Crien þorgh Sarray his Cite
þe last Idus of March after þe ȝere
Phebus þe sonne ful Iolyf was and clere
ffor he was nye his exaltacion
In Martes face and in his mancion
In Aries þe Colerik þe hote signe
fful lusty was þe weder and benigne
ffor which þe fowles aȝeinst þe sonne shene
What for the seson and þe ȝonge grene
fful loude songe hir affeccions
Hem semed han geten hem proteccions
Aȝeinst þe swerd of wynter kene and cold
This Cambynskan of which I haue ȝou told
In Rial vestement sitte vpon his des
Wiþ diame ful high in his paleys
And halt his feest so solempne and so riche
Þat in þis world ne was þer non it liche
Of which if I sal telle al þe araye
Than wold it occupie a somers daye
And eke it nedeþ nat to devise
And euery cours þe order of her seruise
I wil not telle of her strange sewes
Ne of her swannes ne her heronsewes
Eke in þat londe as tellen knyȝtes olde
There is som mete þat is for deynte holde
That in þis londe men recche but small
Þer nys no man þat may reporten all
  
I wil not tary ȝou for it is pryme
And for it is no frute but losse of tyme
Vnto my furst I wil haue my recours
And so byfell þat after þe þred recours
Whil þat þis kinge sitte þus in his nobleye
Herkenyng his menstralles her þingges pleye
Byforn him at þe boord deliciously  
Inne atte halle door so sodeynly
Ther come a knyght vpon a stede of bras
And in his honde a brood myrour of glas
Vpon his þombe he had of gold a rynge
And by his side a naked swerd hangynge
And vp he rideþ to þe heigh boord
In al þe halle ne was þer spoke no word
ffor merveile of þis knyght hym to biholde
fful bisily þei wayten ȝonge and olde
This stronge knyght þat come þus sodeynly
Al armed saue his hede ful richely
Salued þe king þe quene and lordes alle
By ordere as þei seten in þe halle
Wiþ so high reuerence and obeysance
As wel in speche as in his countenance
þat Gawayne wiþ his olde curtasie
þouȝe he come ageyn out of ffarye
Ne coude him nouȝt amende with no word
And after þis bifore þe highe bord
He wiþ a manly vois saide his massage
After þe forme vsed in his langage
Without vice of sillable or of lettre
And for his tale shulde seme þe bettere
Accordant to his wordes was his chere
As techeþ arte of speche hem þat it lere
Al be it þat I can not sowne his styele
Ne can not clymben ouer so hiȝe a styele
Ȝit say I þis þat as to comune entente
Thus moche amounteþ al þat euere he ment
  
If it so be þat I haue it in my mynde
He seide þe kynge of Arabye and of ynde
My liege lord on þis solempne day
Salweþ ȝou as he best can and may
And seendeþ ȝowe in honur of ȝour feste
By me þat am redy al at ȝoure heeste
This stede of bras þat esily and well  
Can in a space of a day naturel
This is to saye in  houres
Wher so ȝou lust in drouȝt or in shoures
Beren ȝoure body in to euery place
To which ȝoure hertes wilneþ forto pace
Wiþoute wemme of ȝou þorow foule or fare
Or if ȝow list to flee as hie in þe Eire
As doþ an Egle whan him list to sore
This same stede shal bere ȝou euermore
Wiþouten harme til ȝe be where ȝou list
þow þat ȝe sclepen on his bak or rest
And turne aȝein wiþ wriþing of a pynne
He þat it wrouȝt cowde ful mony a gynne
He waited mony a constellacion
Or he had doo þis operaciōn
And knewe ful mony a seal and mony a bonde
This myroure eke þat I haue in myn honde
Haþ suche a myȝt þat men may in it see
whan þer shal fallen eny aduersite
Vnto ȝour regne or vnto ȝour self also
And openly who is ȝoure freend or ffoo 
And ouer al þis if eny lady briȝt
Haþ sette her hert in eny maner wiȝt
If he be fals she shal his treson see
His newe loues and al his subtilite
So openly þat þer shal no þing hide
wherfore ageyn þis lusty somers tyde
This myrour and þis ryng þat ȝe may see
He haþ sent to my lady Canacee
  
ȝoure excellent douȝtere þat is here
þe vertue of þis rynge if ȝe wil here
Is þis þat if her list it forto were
Vpon her thombe or in her purs it bere
þer nys no fowle þat fleeþ vnder þe heuene
þat he ne shal vnderstond his steuene
And knowe his menyng openly and pleyne  
And answere him in his langage ageyne
And euery gras þat groweþ vpon rote
She shal wel knowe and whome it wil do bote
And be his woundes neuere so depe and wide
This naked swerd þat hongeþ by my side
Such vertue haþ þat what man so ȝe smyte
þoroweout his armure it wil kerue and bite
were it as thikke as is a braunched oke
And what man þat is wounded with þe stroke
Shal neuere be hool til þat ȝou list of grace
To stroke him with þe plat in þilk place
Ther he is hirt þis is as moche to seyn
ȝe mote with þe plat swerde ageyn
Stroke hym in the wounde and it wil close
This is a verrey soþe wiþouten glose
It failleþ nouȝt þe whilis it is in ȝour holde
And whan þis knyȝt haþ þus þis tale tolde
He rideþ out of þe halle and doun he liȝt
His stede which þat shoon as sonne briȝt
Stant in þe courte stille as eny stoon
This knyght is to his chambre lad anōon
And is vnarmed and to þe mete Isette
þe presentes bene ful richely fette
This is to seyn þe swerd and þe Mirrour
And born anoon vnto þe hie toure
Wiþ certeyn officers yordeyned þerfore
And vnto Canacee þe ryng is bore
Solempnely þer she sitte atte þe table
But sikerly wiþoute eny fable
  
þe hors of bras þat may not be remewed
It stant as it were to þe grounde yglwed 
þer may no man out of þe place it drive
ffor noon engyn of wyndas or polyve
And cause whi for þei can not þe craft
And þerfore in þe place þei han it laft
Tyl þat þe knyȝt haþ tauȝt hem þe manere  
To voyden him as ȝe shal after here
Grete was þe prees þat swarmed to and froo
To Gowren on þis hors þat stondeþ soo 
ffor it so hegh was  and so brode and long
So wel proporciond forto be stronge
Riȝt as it were a stede of lumbardye
Therwiþ so horsly and so quyke of eye
As it a getil poyleis coursere were
ffor Certes from his tale vnto his ere
Nature ne art ne koude hym nouȝt mende
In no degre as al þe puple wende
But euermore hir most wonder was 
Howe þat it cowde gon and was of bras
It was of fayre as þe puple semed
Dyuers folk dyuersly han demed
As mony hedes as mony wittes þer bene
þei Mormured as don a swarme of been
And mede skilles after her fantasies
Rehersinge of þe olde poetries
And seide it was lik þe Pegasee
þe hors þat had wenges forto fle
Or ellis it was þe Grkes hors Synon
That brouȝt Troy to destruction
As men in þise olde Geestes rede
Myne hert quod oon is euere more in drede
I trowe somme men of armes bene þerInne
That shapen hem þis Cite forto wynne
It were riȝt good þat al such þing were knowe
Anoþer rowned to his felawe lowe
  
And seide he lieþ for it is raþer like
An apparence ymade by som magike
As Iogelours pleyen at þise feestes grete
Of sondry þouȝtes þus þei Iangle and trete
As lewde puple demen comonly
Of þingges þat bene made subtily
Than þei can in her lewdenesse comprehende  
þei demen gladly to þe badder ende
An somme of hem wondren on þe myrour
þat born was vp vnto þe maister tour
How men myȝt in hit suche þingges see
Anoþer answerd and seide it myȝt wel be
Naturelli by composiciōns
Of Angeles and of scley reflexiōns
And seide þat in rome was such oon
þei speke of Alocen and Vitilion
And of Aristote þat writ in her lyues
Of queynt Mirours and of prospectyues
As knowen þei þat han her bokes herde
And oþer folk han wondred on þe swerde
þat wold perce þourgh euery þinge
And fille in speche of Thelophus þe kinge
And of Achilles for his queinte spere
ffor he kouþe wiþ it boþ hele and dere
Riȝt in such wise as men may with þe swerde
Of which riȝt nowe ȝe han ȝoure seluen herde
þe speken of sondry hardyng of Metall
And speken of medecynes þerwiþall
And howe and whan it shuld harded be
which is vnknowe algate vnto me
 Tho speke þei of Ganaces rynge
And seiden all þat such a wondere þinge
Of craft of ryngges had þei neuere non
Saue þat he Moyses and kyng Salomon
Had a nane of Conyng in swich arte
Thus seyn þe puple and drawen hem a parte
  
But naþelees somme seide þat it was
wonder to maken of feerne Asshen glas
And ȝit is glas not like asshen of feerne
But for þei han knowen it so ȝerne
Therfore Ceseþ her Iangelinge and her wonder
As sore wondren some on cause of þondere
On ebbe on flood on gossomer and on myst  
And al þing to þe cause is wist
Thus Iangelen þei and demen and devise
Til þat þe kinge can from his bord arise
Phebus haþ laft þe angle Meredyonal
And ȝit ascending was þe beest Royal
þe gentil leon wiþ his Aldrean
Whan þat þis tartre kinge Cambynskan
Roos from his boord þer as he satte ful hie
Byforne him goþ þe lowde Mynstralcye
Til he come to his Chambre of paramentys
Ther as þei sownen dyuers Instrumentys
That is like an heuene forto here
Now daunsen lusty venus children dere
ffor in þe ffissh hir lady satte ful hie
And lokeþ on hem wiþ a frendly ye
This noble kinge is sette vpon his trone
þis straunge knyght is fette to hym ful sone
And on the Daunce he goþ wiþ Canace
Here is þe reuel and þe Iolite
þat is not able a dulle man to deuyse
He most han knowe loue and his seruyse
And be a feestlich man as fressh as may
That shulden ȝou deuysen swich array
Who couþe tellen ȝou þe forme of daunces
So vncouþe and such fressh countynaunces 
Such Subtile lokingges and dyssymulynges
ffor drede of Ialowsie mennys apperceyuynges
No man but launcelett and he is dede
þerfor I passe ouer of al þis lustihede
  
I say no more but in þis Iolynesse
I lete hem to men to soper hem dresse
þe Steward bit spices forto hie
And eke the wyne in al þis melodye
þe vsshers and þe sqwiers ben ygon
þe Spices and þe wyne is come anōn
Thei ete and drinke and whan þis had an ende  
Vnto þe temple as reson was þei wende
 The servise done  þei soupen al by day
whatt nedeþ ȝou rehersen her array
Eche man wote wel þat at a kingges feest
Haþ plente to þe mest and to þe leest
And deyntees moo þan be in my knowinge
And aftere sopere goþ þis noble kynge
To sene þis hors of bras with al a route
Of lordes and ladys hym aboute
Such wondring was þer on þis hors of bras
þat siþen þe grete sege of Troye was
þer as men wondren on an hors also
Ne was þer such a wondering as was þoo
By fynaly þe kinge axeþ þe knyȝt
Þe vertue of þe Coursere and þe myȝt
And preide hym to telle his gouernance
þe hors anon gan forto trippe and dance
whan þat þis knyght leide hond vpon his reyne
And seide Sir þer is to more to seyne
but whan þe list to ride owhere
ȝe moot trille a pynne stonde in his ere
which I shal telle ȝou bytwene vs twoo
ȝe mote nempne hym to what place also
Or to what cuntre þat ȝou list to ride 
And whan ȝe come þere as ȝou list to abide
Bidde hym descende and trille anoþere pynne
ffor þerInne lith þeffecte of al þat gynne
And  wol doune descende and done ȝoure wille
And in þat place he wille abide stille
  
þough al the world had þe contrary swore
He shal not þennys by throwe ne ybore
Or if þou list bidde hym þennes gōōn
Trille þis pynne and he wil vanyssh anōn
Out of þe siȝt of euery maner wiȝt
And come aȝein be it day or nyght
whan þat ȝou list to clepen hym ageyn  
In swich a gise as I shal to ȝou seyn 
Bytwixen ȝou and me and þat ful sone
Ride whan ȝou list þer is no more to done
 Enformed whan þe kyng was of þe knyȝt
And haþ conceyued in his witt ariȝt
The manere and þe forme of al þis þinge
fful glad and bliþe þe noble douȝty kynge
Repeyring to his reuel as byforn
þe bridel is into þe toure born
And kepte amonge his Iwels leef and dere
þe hors vanysshed I note in what manere
Out of her siȝt ȝe gete no more of mee
But þus I lete in lust and Iolite
This Cambynskan is lordes feestinge
Til wel nygh þe day bygan to springe
The norice of digestion is sclepe
Gan on hem wynke and bad hem take kepe
þat moch mete and labour wil haue rest
And wiþ a galping mouþe hem albycast
And seide þat it was tyme to lye adoune
ffor blood was in his domynacioun
Cheressheþ blood natures frende quod he
þei þonken hym galping by two or þre
And euery wight gan drowen hym to his rest
As sclepe hem bad þei toke it for þe best
  
Her dremes mow not be tolde for me
fful were her hedes of ffumosite
þat causet dreem of which þer is no charge
þei sclepen til it was pryme large
þe moste parte but it were Canacee
She was ful mesurable as wommen be
ffor of her fadere had she take her leue
To goo to rest sone after it was Eue
Her list not appalled forto be  
ffor on þe morowe vnfeestlich forto see
And sclepte hure first sclepe and awoke
ffor such a Ioie she in her herte toke
Boþ of her queynt rynge and of her myrour
þat xxti tyme she chaunged her colour
And in her sclepe riȝt for impression
Of her myrour she had a vision
wherfore er þat þe sonne vp gan glide
She cleped vpon her maistresse here beside
And seide þat hir list forto arise
þise olde wommen þat bene gladly wise
As is her maistresse answerd hir anōn
And seide Madame whidere wold ȝe gōn
þus erly for folke bene al in rest
I wil quod she arise for me lest
No lenger slepen but walken aboute
Her Maistresse clepeþ wommen a grete route
And vp þei risen wel  ten or twelue
Vpriseþ fresshe Canace her selue
As roddy and briȝt as þei þe ȝonge sonne
þat in þe Ram is ten degrees vp ronne
Noon hier was he whan she redy was
And forþ she walked esily a pas
Arraied aftere þe lusty seson sote
liȝtly forto prey and walk on fote
Nat but v or vj of her mayne
And in a trenche fer in þe park gooþ she
  
The vapour which þat fro þe erthe glode
Makeþ þe sonne to seme rody and brode
But naþelees it was so faire a siȝt
Þat it made all her hertes forto liȝt
What for þe seson and þe mowrnynge
And for þe fowles þat she herde synge
ffor riȝt anoon she wist what þei ment
Riȝt by her songe and knewe al her entent
 The knotte whi þat euery tale is told  
ȝif it be taried til lust be cold
Of hem þat han it herkened after ȝore
Þe Sauour passeþ euer lenger þe more
ffor ffulsomnesse of prolixite
And by þis same reson þenkeþ me
I shuld vnto þe knotte condescende
And maken of her walking sone an ende
 Amydde a tree fordrye as white as chalke
As Canacee was plaiyng in her walke
þer satte a fawcon ouer her hede ful hie
þat wiþ a pitous vois so gan to crie
þat alle in þe wode resed of her crie
And beten had her self so pitously
Wiþ bothe her wenges to þe rede blode
Ranne endelonge þe tre þer as she stode
And euer in oon she cried alway and shright
And wiþ her beke her seluen so she piȝt
þat þer ne was Tigre ne cruel beest
þat dwelleþ eiþer in wode or in forest
þat ne wold haue wepte if þat she wepe couþe
ffor sorowe of hir she shright alway so louþe
ffor þer nas neuere ȝit man on lyue
If þat I coude a fawcon wel discryve
þat herd of such anoþer of fairnesse
As wel of plummage as of gentilnesse
Of shappe of al þat myȝt rekned be
A fsawcon peregryne þan semed she 
  
Of fremde londe and eueremore as she stode
She swowned nowe and nowe for lakke of blood
Til wel nygh is she fallen fro þe tre
This faire kyngges doughter þis Canace
þat on her fynger bere þe queynte rynge
þorgh which she vnderstode wel euery þinge
þat eny foule may in his ledne seyne
And coude answere him in his ledne ageyne
Haþ vnderstonde þat þis fawcon seide  
And wel nygh for þe rouþe almest she deide
And to þe tree she goþ ful hastely
And on þis faucon lokeþ ful pitously
And helde her lappe abrood for wel she wist
þe faucon most falle from þe twist
Whan þat it swouned next for lacke of blode
A longe while to waite her she stode
Til atte last she spake in þis manere
Vnto þe hawke as ȝe shal after here
 What is þe cause if it be forto telle
þat ȝe bene in þis furial peyn of helle
Quod Canacee vnto þis hawke aboue
Is þis for sorowe of deth or losse of loue
ffor as I trowe þise bene causes two
Þan causen most a gentil hert woo 
Of other harme it nedeþ not to speke
ffor þi ȝoure self vpon youre self ȝou wreke
Which þat proueth wel þat eiþere ire or drede
Mote bene encheson of ȝoure cruel dede
Siþ þat I see noon oþer wiȝt ȝou chace
ffor loue of god so doþ ȝour self grace
Or what may be ȝoure helpe for west nor este
Ne seghe I neuere er nowe ne brid ne beste
þat ferde wiþ him self so pitously
ȝe sclee me wiþ ȝoure sorowe verreyly
I haue of ȝou so grete compassioun
ffor goddes loue come fro þe tree adoun
  
And as I am a kingges douȝthter trewe
If þat I verrely þe causes knewe
Of ȝoure disse if it lay in my myȝt
I wold amende it er þat it were nyȝt
As wisly helpe me grete god of kinde
And Erbes shal I riȝt ynow fynde
To hele wiþ ȝoure hirtes hastely
þoo shright þis fawcon ȝit more pitously
þan euere she did and fille to grounde anōn  
And lith a swowne dede as is þe ston
Til Canacee haþ in hure lappe her take
Vnto þat tyme she gan of swowne awake
And after þat she of swowne gan vpbreide
Riȝt in hire hawkes leodene þus she seide
 þat pite renneþ sone in gentil herte
ffeling his symilitude in peynes smerte
Is proued alday as men may it see
As wel be werk as be auctorite
ffor gentil hert kepeþ gentillesse
I se wele þat ȝe han on my distresse
Compassion my faire Canacee
Of verrey wommanly benignyte
That nature in ȝoure principles haþ sette
But for noon hope forto fare þe bette
But forto obeye vnto ȝoure herte free
And forto maken oþer be ware by me
As by þe whelpe chastised is the lyōn
Riȝt for þat cause and for þat conclusion
While þat I haue a leisere and a space
Myn harme I wil confessen er I pace
And euere while þat she her sorowe told
þat oþer wepte as she to water wold
Til þat þe ffaucon bad hir to be stille
And wiþ a sighe þus she seide hir tille
Ther I was bredde allas þat ilk daye
And fostred in a roche of Merbel graye
  
So tenderly þat no þing eiled me
I ne wist not what was aduersite
Til I coude flee ful hie vndere þe skie
Tho dwelled a tercelet me fast by
þat semed welle of al gentilnesse
Al were he ful of treson and falsnesse
It is wrapped vnder humble chere
And vnder hwe of trouþe and in such manere 
Vndere plesaunce and vnder bisy peyne  
þat no wight couþe han wende he coude feyne
So depe in greyne he dyed his coloures 
Riȝt as a serpent hyd hym vnder floures
Til he may se his tyme forto bite
Riȝt so þis god of loue ypocrite
Doþ so his serymonijs and obeysances
And kepeþ in semblaunt al his obseruaunces 
That sowneþe into gentilnesse of loue
As in a tompe is al þe faire aboue
And vnder is þe cours which as ȝe wote
Such was þis ypocrite boþ colde and hote
And in þis wise he serued his entente
þat saue þe feende non wist what he mente
Til he so longe had wepte and compleyned
And many a ȝeer his servise to hym feyned
Til þat myn hert to pitous and to nyce
Al Innocent of his crowned malice
fforferde of his deþ as þouȝt me
Vpon his oþes and his Suerte
Graunted hym loue vpon þis condicioun
þat euer moo myn honure and my renoun
Were saued boþ privey and apert
þis is to seyn þat after his dissert
I ȝaue hym al myn hert and my þouȝt
God woot and he þat oþer wise nouȝt
And toke his hert in chaunge of myn for ay
But soþ is seide go siþen mony a day
  
A trewe wight and a þeef thenkeþ not oōn
And whan he sawe þe þing so fer ygon
þat I  graunted hym fully my loue
In such a gise as I haue seide aboue
An ȝeuen hym my trewe hert as free
As he swore he ȝaf his hert to me
Anon þis tigre ful of doublenesse
ffil on his knees wiþ so deuoute humblesse
Wiþ hye reuerence and as by his chere  
So like a gentile louere of manere
So rauisshed as it semed for þe Ioye
Þat neuere Iason ne Paris of Troye
Iason certes ne noon oþere man
Siþ Lameþ was þat alþer furst biganne
To louen two as writen folk toforne
Ne neuere siþ þe first man was born
Ne coude man by xxti þousand part
Countrefete þe sophymes of his arte
Ne were worþi to vnbocle his galoche
Þer dowblenesse or faynyng shuld approche
Ne so couþe þonke a wiȝt as he did me
His manere was an heuene for to see
Til eny womman were she neuere his wys
So peynted he and kembeþ at poynt devis
As wel his wordes as his countenaunce
And I so loued hym for his obeysaunce
And for þe trouþe I demed in his hert
þat if so were þat eny þinge hym smerte
Al were it neuere so lite and I it wist
Me þouȝt I felt deþ at myn herte twiste
And shortely so ferforþ þis þinge wente
þat my wille haþ his willes Instrument
þis is to seyne my wille obeied his wille
In al þinge as ferre as reson fille
Kepinge þe boundes of my worship euere
Ne neuere had I þinge so leef ne leuere
  
As hym god wote ne neuere shal no moo 
þis last lenger þan a ȝere or twoo
 That I Suppose of hym no þing but good
But fynaly þus at the ende it stood
þat fortune wold þat he most twynne
Out of þat place which þat I was Inne
where me were woo it is no question
I can not make of it discripcion
ffor oon þinge dar I telle boldely  
I knowe what is þe peyne of deþ þerby
Such harme I felt for he no wiȝt byleue
So on a day of me he toke his leue
So sorowefulli eke þat I wende verrely
þat he had feled as moche harme as I
Whan þat I herde hym speke and segh his hwe
But naþelees I þouȝt he was so trewe
And eke þat he repeire shuld agayn
WiþInne a litel while soþ to sayn
And reson wold eke þat he most goo
ffor his honoure as oft happeþ soo
Þat I made vertue of necessite
And toke it wel siþ þat it most be
As I best myght I hid fro hym my sorowe
And toke hym by þe honde seint Iohn to borowe
And seide þus loo I am ȝoures all
Beþ swich as I haue be to you and shal
what he answerd it nedeþ not reherce
who can seyn bette þan he who can do wors
whan he haþ al wel seide þan haþ he done
Þerfore bihoueþ hym a ful longe spone
þat shal eten with a feend þus herd I seye
So at þe last he mote forþ his weye
And forþ he fleeþ til he come þer hym list
whan it come hym to purpoos for to rist
 I trowe he had þilk texte in mynde
Þat al þinge repeiryng to his kinge
  
Gladeþ hym self þus seyn men as I gesse
Men louen of propre kinde newfangilnesse
As briddes doon þat men in cages fede
ffor þeigh þou nyȝt and day take of hym hede
And strawe her cage faire and soft as silk
And ȝeue hem sugre  hony  brede and mylk
Ȝit right anoon as þat his door is vppe
He wiþ his feete wil spurne doun his cuppe
And to þe wode he wil and wormes ete  
So newfangle bene þei of her mete
And louen nouelries of propre kinde
No gentilnesse of blood may hem bynde
So ferde þis tercelet allas þe day
Thowe he were gentill born fressh and gay
And goodly forto sene  humble and free
He segh vpon a tyme a kite fle
And sodeynly he loued þis kite soo
That al his loue is clene fro me goo
And haþ his trowþe falsed in þis wise
Thus haþ þe kite my loue in her seruyse
And I am lorn withouten remedye
And wiþ þat worde þis fawcon gan to crie
And swowned eft in Canaces barme
Grete was þe sorowe for þat haukes harme
That Canacee and alle her wommen made
Þei nyst howe þat þei myȝt þe faucon glade
But Canace home bereþ her in hir lappe
And softely in plaasters gan hir wrappe
Þer as she with hire beek had hurt her selue
Nowe can not Canace but herbes delue
Out of the grounde and maken salues newe
Of herbes precious and fyne of hewe
To helen wiþ þe hauke from day to nyȝt
She doþ her bysynesse and al her myȝt
And by hire beddes hede she made a mewe
And keuered it wiþ veluetes blewe
  
In signe of trouþe þat is in wommen sene
And All wiþoute þe mwee is peinted grene
In whiche were peynted all þise fals foules
As bene þise tydifs  tercelettes and owles
Riȝt for þe spite were peynted hem biside
Pies on hem forto crie and chide
þus lete I Canace her hauke kepinge
I wil no more as nowe speke of her rynge
Til it come eft to purpoos forto seyn  
Howe þat þis faucon gate her loue ageyn
Repentaunt as þe story telleþ vs
By mediacion of Camballus
þe kyngges sone of which I ȝou tolde
But hens forþ I wil processe holde
To speken of auentures and of batailles
That ȝit was neuere herde so grete merveiles
ffirst wil I telle ȝou of Cambynskan
That in his tyme mony a Cite wan
And aftere wil I speke of algarsif
How þat he wan Theodora to his wiff
ffor whan ful oft in grete perill he was
Ne had he bene holpen by þe hors of bras
And aftere wil I speke of Camballo
þat faught in listes wiþ þe breþeren two
ffor Canace er þat he myȝt hir wynne
And þer I left wil I ageyn bygynne
Apollo whirleþ vp his chare so hie
Til þat þe god Mercurius hous þe sclie
In feiþ Squier þow hast þe wel yquytte
And gentely I preise wel þi witte
Quod þe merchaunt consideryng þi ȝouþe
So felingly þou spekest sir I þe alouþe
As to my dome þer is non þat is here
Of Eloquence þat shal be þi pere

And in vertue sende the Contynaunce
ffor of þi speche I haue gret deynte
I haue a sone and by þe trinite
I had leuere þan xxti pounde worþ lond
þough it were riȝt nowe fallen in my hond
Ȝe ere a man of such discrecion
As þat ȝe ben fy on possession
But ȝif a man be uertuous withal
I haue my sone snybbed and ȝit shal 
ffor he to vertue listeþ not entende  
But forto pley atte dys and to dispende
And lese al þat he haþ is his vsage
And he haþ leuere talke wiþ a page
Þan to comune wiþ a gentile wiȝt
where he myȝt lerne gentillesse ariȝt
A strawe for ȝoure gentilnesse quod our Hoost
What Marchaunte parde Sir wel þou woost
That ech of ȝou mote tellen at þe leest
A tale or twoo or breken his bihest
That knowe I well quod þe Merchaunte certeyn
I prey ȝou haueþ not me in disdeyne
  
Þouȝe to þis man I speke a word or twoo
Telle on þi tale wiþouten wordes moo 
Gladly sir ooste quod he I wil obeye
Vnto ȝour wille now herkeneþ what I seye
I wil ȝou not contrarye in no wise
As ferre as my wittes wil suffise
I prey to god þat it may plesen ȝou
þan woot I wele þat it is good ynowe
Whilom þer was dwellinge in lumbardy
A worþi knyȝt þat born was at Pavy
In which he lyued in grete prosperite
And sixty ȝere a wyuelees man was he
And folowed ay his bodely delite
On womman þer as was his Appetite
As doon þise fooles þat bene seculers
And whan þat he was past sixty ȝeres
Were it for holynesse or ellis for dotage
I can not seye but suche a corage
had þis knyght to be a wedded man
That day and nyght he doþ al þat he can
To aspie where he myȝt wedded be
Preiynge our lord to graunt hym þat he 
Might ones knowe þat blisful liff  
þat is bytwixe an husbonde and his wif
And for to lyuen vnder þat holy band
Wiþ which god furste man to womman band
Noon oþer lif seide he is worþ a bene
ffor wedloke is so esi and so clene
That in þis world it is a paradys
Thus seiþ þis olde knyȝt þat was so wis
And certeynly as soþ as god is kinge
To take a wif it is a glorious þinge
And namely whan a man is olde and hoore
þan is a wif þe frute of his tresore
þan shuld he take a ȝonge wif and a faire
On which he myȝt engender him an aire
  
And lede his lif in Ioye and solace
Wher as þe bachilers synggen alas
Whan þei fynde eny aduersite
In loue which þat is but childes vanite
And trewly it sitte wel to be soo
That bachilers han ofte peyne and woo
On brutel grounde þei beelde brutelnesse
þei fynde whan þei wene sikernesse
þei lyue but as a bridde or a beest
In liberte and vnder nyce areest
þer as a wedded man in his astate
Lyueþ his lif blisful and ordynate
Vndere þe ȝok of mariage ybounde
Wel may his hert in Ioye and blisse be founde
ffor who can be so buxom as a wif
Who is so trewe and eke so tentiff
To kepe him seke and hole as is his make
ffor wel ne woo she wil not hym forsake
She nys not wery hym to loue and serue
þouȝe þat he lye bedrede til he sterue
And ȝit somme clerkes sein þat it is not soo
Of which theofraste is oon of þoo 
What foorce þouȝt Thophrast lusteþ lye  
Ne take no wif quod he for husbondrye
As forto spare in household þi dispence
A trewe seruaunte doþ more diligence
Thi good to kepe þan þine owne wif
ffor she wil cleyme half part al her lif
And ȝif þat þou be seke so god me saue
Thi verrey frendes or a trewe knaue
Wil kepe þe better þan she þat waiteþ ay
Aftere þi good and haþ do mony a day
And if þou take a wif 1þat to þe is vntrewe
fful ofte tyme it shal þe Rwe1
This entent an hundred siþes wors
writeþ þis man þer god his bonys curs
  
But take no kepe of al such vanyte
Defie Theofrast and herkeneþ me
A wiff is goddys ȝift verreyly
Al oþer manere ȝiftes hardely
As londes  rentes pasture or comune
Or mebles al bene ȝiftes of fortune
þat passen as a shadowe on a wall
But drede it nouȝt pleynly speke I shall
A wiff wil last and in þine hous endure
Wel more þan þe list perauenture
Mariegge is a ful grete sacrament
Who haþ no wiff I telle hym shent
He lyueþ helplees and is al desolate
I speke of folk in seculere astate
And herken whi  I seie not þis for nouȝt
þe womman is for mannes helpe ywrouȝt
þe highe god whan he had Adam maked
And seghe him alone bely naked
God of his grete goodnesse seide þan 
Lat vs make an helpe vnto þis man
Like to hym self and þan he made Eue
Here may ȝee see and herby may ȝe preue
þat þe wisf is mannys Comfort  
His Paradys terrestre and his disport
So buxom and so vertuous is she
þei moste nedes lyue in vnite
Oo flessh þei bene and two soules as I gesse
Haþ but oon hert in hele and in distresse
A wif a seynt Mary benedicite
How myȝt a man han eny aduersite
Þat haþ a wiff certes I can not seie
Þe blisse þat is ytwixe hem tweye
Þer may no tunge tellen or hert þenk
If he be poor she helpeþ him to swynk
She kepeþ his good and waasteþ neuer a dele
Al þat her husbond lust she likeþ wele
  
She seiþ not onys nay whan he seith ȝe
Doþ þis seiþ he  al redy sire seiþ she
O blisful ordere of wedloke precious
Þou arte so mery and eke so vertuous
And so commended and so appreued eke
Þat euery man þat halt him worþ a leke
Vpon his bare knees auȝt al his lif
Thanken his god þat him haþ sent a wif
Oyþer prei to god him for to sende
A wiff to last vnto his lyues ende
ffor þan his lif is sette in sikernesse
He may not be desceyued as I gesse
So þat he worche after his wyues rede
þan may he boldely bere vp his hede
þei bene so trewe and also wys
ffor which if þou wilt worchen as þe wis
Do alway so as wommen wil þe rede
Loo howe þat Iacob as þise clerkes rede
By good counseil of his modere Rebekke
Boonde þe kyddes skyn about his nekke
ffor which his faders benyson he wan
Loo Iudith as þe storie telle can
Be wise counsail she goddes puple kepte  
And sclowe hym Olophernes while he sclepte
Lo Abygail by counseille how she
Saued her husbonde Naball whan þat he
Shuld haue be sclayne and loke aster alsoo
By good counsaile delyuered out of woo
þe puple of god and made hym marche
Of assure enchaunced forto be
Ther is no þinge in grete superlatif
As seiþ seneke  an humble wif
Suffre þi wifes tunge as Caton bitte
She shal commaunde and þou shalt suffre it
And ȝit she wil obeye of Curtesie
A wif is keper of þine husbondrye
  
wele may þe seke man byweile and wepe
þer as þer nys no wif þe hous to kepe
I warne þe ȝif wisly þou wirche
Loue wel þi wif as crist loueþ his chirche
If thou louest þi self wel  þou louest þi wif
No man hateþ his flessh but in his lif
He fostreth it and þerfore bid I þe
Cherisshe þi wif or þou shalt neuere the
Husbonde and wif what so men Iape or pleye
Of worldly folk holde þe siker weye
They bene so knytte þer may noon harme betide
And namely vpon þe wives side
ffor which þis Ianuarie of which I tolde
Considered haþ wiþin his daies olde
Þe lusty lif þe vertuous quiete
Þat is in mariage hony swete
And for his frendes on a day he sent
To tellen hem the effecte of his entent
wiþ face sadde his tale he haþ hem told
He saide frendes I am hoor and olde
And almost god wote vpon þe pittes brinke
Vpon my soule somwhat I most þenke
I haue my body folily dispended   
Blessed be god it shal be amended
ffor I wil bene certeyn a wedded man
And þat anon in al þe hast I can
Vnto some maide faire and tender of age
I prey ȝou shapeþ for my mariage
Al sodeynly for I wil not abide
And I wil foonden to aspie on my side
To whoom I may be wedded hastely
But for as moche as ȝe bene more þan I
Ȝe shul raþer such a þinge espien
Þan I and þer me lust best to alien
But of on þing I warne ȝou my frendes dere
I nyl noon olde wif haue in no manere
  
She shal not passe xvj ȝere in fayn
Old fissh and ȝonge flessh þat wil I haue certayn
Bett is quod he a pke þan a pikerell
And bette þan olde beef is þe tender veell
I wil no womman of xxxti wynter age
It is but bene strawe and grete forage
And eke þise olde wyues god it wote
þei konnen so moche craft on wades bote
So mochel broke harme whan þat hem lest
That wiþ hem shuld I neuer lyuen in rest
ffor sondry scoles makeþ subtile clerkes
Womman of mony scoles  half a clerk es
But certeyn a yonge þing may man gye
Riȝt as men may warme wax with handis plye
Wherfore I seie ȝou pleynly in a clause
I nyl non olde wif han riȝt for þis cause
ffor if so were I had some meschaunce
þat  in hire ne couþe haue no plesaunce
þan shuld I lede my lif in auenture
And so streite to þe deuel sure
Ne children shuld I noon vpon hure geten
Ȝit had me leuere þat houndes had me eten
Than þat myne Heritage shulde falle  
In straunge honde and þus I telle ȝou all
I dote not  I not þe cause whi
Men shuld wedde and ferthermore wote I
Ther spekeþ mony a man of Mariage
þat wote no more of it þan doþ my page
ffor whiche causes men shuld take a wif
Ȝif he may not chaast bene his lif
Take him a wif wiþ grete deuocion
Bycause of leeful procreacion
Of children to þe honure of god aboue
And nouȝt only for paramour ne for loue
And for þei shulden leccherie eschewe
And ȝeelde her dettes while þat it is newe
  
Or for þat eche man shuld helpe oþere
In meschief as sustere shal to broþere
And lyve in chastite ful heuenly
But sirs by ȝoure leue þat am not I
ffor god byþonke it  I dar make auaunte
I fele my lymmes sterke and suffisaunt
To done al þat a man bylongeþ to
I wote my self best what I may do
þouȝ I be hoor I fare as doþ a tre

I fele no where hoor but on my hede
Myne hert and my lymmes ben as grene
As lauriel is þorgh þe ȝere to sene
And sythen ȝe han herd al myn entent
I prey ȝou to my wille ȝe assent
Dyuers men dyuersly hym told
Of Mariage mony ensamples olde
Somme blamen it somme preisen it certayn
But at þe laste shortely forto sayn
As alday falleþ altercacion
Bitwixen frendes in disputacion

Of which þat oon is cleped placebo 
Iustinus soþly called was þat other
Placebo seide oo I am ȝoure broþere
fful litel nede han ye my lord so dere
Counseile to aske of ony þat is here
But þat ȝe bene so ful of Sapience
That ȝou ne likeþ for ȝoure high prudence
To weyue from þe word of Salomon
This word seiþ he vnto vs everechon
Wirk al þing by counseile þus seide
And þan shalt þou not repent þe
But þeigh þat Salomon speke such a word
Myn owne dere broþer and my lord
  
So wisly god bring my saule at ese and rest

That he seiþ I holde it forme and stable

A ful grete fool is eny counselour

That his counsaile shuld passe his lordes witte
Nay lordes bene no fooles be my fay
Ȝe haue ȝoure self spoken here to day
So high sentence so holy and so well
That I consent and conferme euery dele

Criste holdeþ of þis hym ful wel apaied
And trewly it is an hie corage
Of eny man þat stoupeþ into age
To take a ȝonge wif be my fader kynne
Ȝoure hert hongeþ vpon a Ioly pynne
Doþ now in þis matere riȝt as ȝou leste
ffor fynally I holde it for þe best
 Iustinus þat ay stille satte and herde
Riȝt in þis wise he to placebo ansuerde
Nowe broþer myn be pacient I prey
Siþens þat ȝe han seide herken what I sey
Senek amonges oþer wordes wise
Seiþ þat a man ouȝt hym wel avise
  
To whom he ȝeueth his land or his catell
And siþens I ought avise me riȝt well
To whoom I ȝeue my 
Welle more I aughte auysede be
To whome I yeue my  
I warne you wel it is no childes play
To taken a wif wiþout avisement
Men most enquere þis is myn assent
Whedere she be wis  sobre or dronklewe
Eyþer proude or oþer wise a shrewe
A chidere eiþer a waaster of þi good
Or riche or poor  or ellis a man is wood
Al be it so þat no man fynde shal
Non in þis world þat treteþ hool in all
Ne man ne beest such as men con devise
But naþelees it aught ynowe suffise
Wiþ eny wif ȝif so were þat ȝe hadde
Moo good thewes þan her vices badde
And al þis askeþ leisere to enquere
ffor god wote I haue wepte mony a tere

Preise who so wil a wedded mannys lif
Certeyn I fynde in it but cost and care
And obseruaunces of al blessed bare 
And ȝit god þonk my neighbours al aboute  
A namely of wommen a grete route
Sein þat I haue þe most stedefast wiff
And eke þe mekest oon þat bereþ liff
But I woote best wher wrieþ  my shoo
ȝe may for me riȝt as ȝou list doo
Aviseþ ȝou ȝe bene a man of age
Howe þat ȝe entren into mariage
And namely wiþ a ȝonge wif and a feire
By him þat made water erþe and Eyre
þe ȝongest man þat is in al þis route
Is bisy ynouȝe to bringe it aboute
  
To haue his wiff allone tresteþ me
Ȝe shullen not plesen hure ȝeres þre
This is to seyn to done her plesaunce
A wiff axeþ ful mony an obseruaunce
I prey ȝou þat ȝe ne be euel apaide
Wel quod þis Ianuar and hastowe al saide
Strawe for þi senek and for þi prouerbes
I count not a panyer ful of herbes
Of scole teermes wiser men þan thou
As þou hast herd assenteþ it riȝt nowe
 To my purpoos Placebo what say ȝe
I sey it is a cursed man quod he
That letteþ Matrimoyne Sikerly
And wiþ þat word þei risen sodeynly
And bene assented fully þat he shuld
Wedded be whan hym list and where he wold
Thy fantasie and þi curiousnesse
ffro day to day gan in þi soule inpresse
Of Ianuar about his mariage
Mony faire shappe and mony faire visage
Ther passeþ his hert nyȝt by nyght
As who so toke a myrour polshed bright
And sette it in a comune Market place
þan shuld he seen mony a figure pace
By his Miroure and in þe same wise  
Can Ianuar in wiþ his þouȝt devise
Of Maidens which þat dwellen  beside
O He wist not where he myȝt abide
ffor þouȝe þat oon haue beute in her face
Anoþer stant so in þe puples grace
ffor her sadnesse and her benignite
þat of þe puple grettest vois had she
And somme were riche and hadden badde name
But na þe lees bytwixe ernest and game
He atte last enpoynted hym in oon
A lete al oþer from his herte goon
  
And chese hire of his owne auctorite
ffor loue is blynde al day and may not se
And whan þat he was in þe bedde brouȝt
He purtreide in his hert and in his þouȝt
Her freisshe beaute and her age tendere
Hir myddel smalle her armes longe and sclendere
Her wise gouernaunce and her gentilnesse
Her wommanly beringe and her sadnesse
And whan þat he to her was condescended
Hym þouȝt his chois myȝt not be amended
ffor whan þat he him self concluded had
Hym þouȝt eche oþer mannys witt so bad
þat inpossible it were to replie
Aȝeinst his chois þis was his fantasie
His frendes sent he to at his instance
And preieþ him to done hym þat plesance
That hastely þei wolde to hym come
He wold abreggen her labour al and some
Hit nedeþ no more to hem to goo ne ride
He was apointed þer he wold abide
Placebo came and eke his frendes sone
And alþer first he bad hem all a bone
þat noon of hem noon argumentes make
Aȝeinst his purpoos which þat he haþ take
Which purpoos was plesaunt to god as seide he  
And verrey grounde of his prosperite
He saide þer was a mayden in þe toune
Which þat of bewte haþ grete renoun
Al were it so she were of smal degre
Suffiseth him her ȝouþe and her bewte
Which mayde he seide he wold haue to wif
To leden in eese and in holynesse his lif
And þonkeþ god þat he myȝt han hir all
þat no wiȝt his blisse part shall
And preieþ him to labour in þis nede
And shapen þat he faile not to spede
  
ffor þan he seide his spirit was at eese
þen is quod he no þing me may displese
 Saue oon þinge prikkeþ in my conscience
þe which I wil reherce in ȝoure presence
I haue quod he herd saie ful ȝore agoo
þer may no man han parfit blesses twoo
Þis is to saie in erþe and eke in heuene
ffor þei he kepte him from þe synnes seuene
And eke fro euery brannche of thilk tree
ȝit is þere so parfit prosperite
And so grete eese and lust in mariage
That euer I am agast nowe in myn age
þat I shal lede nowe so mery a lif

That y shal han myn heuene in erthe  
ffor siþens þat verrey heuene is bouȝt so dere
Wiþ tribulacion and grete penaunce
how shuld I such in such plesaunce
As alle wedded men done wiþ her wives
Come to þe blisse þere crist eterne alyue es
This is my drede and ȝe my breþere tweye
Assoilleþ me þis question I ȝou preye
 Iustinus which þat hated his foly
Answerd anon riȝt in his Iapry
And for he wold his longe tale abregge
He wolde noon autorite alegge
But seide sir so þere bene noon obstacle  
Oþer þan þis god of his hye myracle
And of his mercy may so for ȝou wirche
That er ȝe han ȝoure ȝiftes of holy chirche
ȝe may repent of wedded mannys lif
In which ȝe seyn is neiþer woo ne strif
And ellis god forbede but ȝif he sent
A wedded man grace hym to repent
Wel often raþer þan a syngle man 
And þerfor sir þe best rede I can
  
Dispeireþ ȝou nouȝt haueþ in memorie
Perauenture she may be ȝour purgatorie
She may be goddis mene and goddys whippe
Than shal ȝoure soule vp to heuen skippe
Swifter þan doþ an arowe out of a bowe
I hope to god here aftere ȝe shal knowe
þat þer nys noon so grete felicite
In mariage ne neuere more shal be
þat ȝou shal lak of ȝour saluacion
So þat ȝe vse as skille is and reson
þe lustes of ȝoure wif attemperally
And þat ȝe plese hure not to amerously
And þat ȝe kepe ȝou eke fro oþer synne
My tale is done for my witte is þinne
Beþ not agast herof my broþer
But lat vs wade from þis mater to an oþere
þe wif of baþe if ȝe wil vnderstonde
Of mariage which ȝe han on honde
Declaren can ful wel in litel space
ffareþ nowe wel god haue ȝou in his grace
And wiþ þis word þis Iustyne and his broþere
Han take her leue and ech of hem of oþere
ffor whan þei segh it most nedes be
þei wrouȝten so by wise and sclegh trete
þat she þis maide which þat Mayus hiȝt
As hastely as euere þat she myȝt
Shal wedded be vnto Ianuarye  
I trowe it were to longe ȝou to tary
If I ȝou tolde of euery scrite or bonde
By which þat she was festned in his londe
Eiþer forto herken of her riche aray
But fynaly ycommen is þe day
þat to þe churche boþ bene þei went
fforto receyue þe holy sacrament
fforþ commeþ þe preest wiþ stole about his neke
And bad hir be ylik sarra and rebek
  
In wisdom and  trouþe of mariage
And saide his orisons as is his vsage
And crowched hem and bad god shuld hem blisse
And made al siker ynough with holynesse
Thus bene þei wedded with solempnite
And at þe feeste sitteþ he and she
Wiþ oþer worþi folk vpon þe dees
Al ful of Ioye and blisse is þe paleys
And ful of instrumentes and of vitaile
þe moste deyntevous of al Ytaile
Byforn hem of instrumentis which soun
þat Orpheus ne of phebes ampheoun
Ne maden neuere suche a melody
And at euery cours came loude mynstralcye
That neuere Ioab trumped forto here
Neiþer Theodomas ȝit half so clere
And Thebes whan þe cite was in doute
Bacus þe wyne hem shenkeþ al aboute
And Venus laugheþ on euery wiȝt
ffor Ianuar was bycome her knyȝt
And wolde boþ assaien his corage
In liberte and eke in mariage
And wiþ hure fuyr bronde with her hand aboute
Daunseth byforne þe bride al aboute
And clenly I dar wel seyn right þis
Emyneus þat god of weddyng is 
Segh neuere in his lif so mery a wedded man  
Holde þou þi pees þou poete Marcean
þat writest vs þat ilk wedding mery
Of hure Philologi and of Marcury
And of þe sanges þat þe muses songe
So smale as eke þi penne and eke þi tunge
fforto discryuen of þis mariage
Whan tender ȝouþe haþ wedded stouping age
þer is suche myrþe þat it may not be writte
Assaieþ it ȝoure self þan may ȝe wite
  
ȝif þat I lak or noon in þis matere
Mayus þat sitte wiþ so benygne a chere
Hire to biholde it semed faierye
Queen Estre loked neuere wiþ such an ye
On assure so meke a loke as she
I may ȝou not avise al her bewte
But þus moche of her bewte telle I may
þat she was like þe briȝt morowe of may
ffulfillede of beaute and of plesaunce
This Ianuar is rauissht in a traunce
And at euery tyme he loked on hir face
But in his hert he gan hir to manace
þat he þat nyȝt in armes wold hir streyn
Harder þan euere Paris did Eleyn
But naþelees ȝit had he grete pite
þat ilke nyȝt offenden her most he
And þought alas o tender creature
Nowe god wold ȝe myȝt wel endure
Al my corage it is so sharpe and kene
I am agast ȝe shul it not sustene
But god forbede þat I did al my myȝt
Nowe wolde god þat it were wexen nyȝt
And þat þe nyȝt wolde lasten euere moo
I wold þat al þis puple were agoo
And fynaly he doþ al his laboure
As he best myȝt sauyng his honoure
To hast hem fro þe mete in subtile wise  
The tyme came þat reson was to rise
And after þat men daunce and drinke fast
And spices al aboute þe hous þei cast
And ful of ioye and blisse is euery man
All sauf a squyer þat hiȝt damyan
which carf tofore þe king mony day
He was so rauysshed on his lady may
That for þe verrey peine he was nyȝe wode
Almost he swalte an swowned þer he stode
  
As she him ladde daunsinge in her hand
So fresshe she was and þerto so likand
And to his bedde he went hym hastely
No more of him at this tyme speke I
But þere I lete him wepe ynow and pleyn
Til fresshe may wil rewen on his peyn
 O perilous fyre þat in þe bedstrawe bredeþ
O famulere foo þat his seruise bedeþ
O seruaunte traitoure fals  holy hewe
Like to þe adder sclegh and in Basom vntrewe
God shilde vs alle from ȝoure iniquitaunce
O Ianuare dronken in plesaunce
Of Mariage se howe þi damyan
Thyne owne squyer and þi born man
Entendeþ to done þe vilanye
God graunte þe þine harme forto aspie
ffor in þis world nys no wors pestilence
Than homely foo alday in þi presence
Parfourmed haþ þis day his arke dyurne
No lenger may þe body of hym soiourne
þe Orisonte as in þat latitude
Riȝt wiþ his mantel þat is derk and Rude
Gan forto sprede þe mysprey aboute
ffor which departed is þe lusty route
ffor Ianuare wiþ þonke on euery side
Hoom to her howses lustely þei ride
Ther as þei done her þingges as hem lust  
And whan þei segh her tyme to go to rest
Sone aftere þat þis hastif Ianuar
Wol go to bedde he wil no lenger tar
He drinkeþ Ypocras clerre and vernage
Of spices hote to encresen his corage
And many a letuare had he ful fyne
Such as þe cursed monk daune Costantyne
Haþ writen in his boke of Coytu
To eten hem al he nas no þing eschwe
  
And þus to his privey frendes seide he
ffor goddis loue as sone as it may be
Lette voiden al þis hous in curteys wise sone
Men dronken and þe trauers drowe anōn
The bride was brouȝt to bedde as stille as eny ston
So hasted Ianuar it most be dōn
And whan þe bedde was with þe preest yblessed
Out of þe Chambre haþ euery wiȝt hym dressed
And Ianuare haþ fast in armes take
His fresshe may his paradis his make
He lulleth hure he kisseth hure ful oft
Wiþ þilke bristels of his beerd vnsoft
Ylike to þe skyn of hounde fissh sharpe as brere
ffor he was shaue al newe in his manere
He rubbeþ hure vpon her tendere face
And seide þus alace I mote trespace
To ȝou my spouse and ȝou gretly offende
Or tyme come þat I wil doune descende
But naþelees considereþ þis quod he
þer nys no werkman what so euer he be
þat may boþe worche wel and hastely
þis wil be done at leisere parfitely
It is no force howe longe þat we pleye
I trowe in wedloke coupled bene we tweye
And blessed by the yokke þat we bene Inne
ffor in our actys we may do no synne ·
A man may do no synne wiþ his wiff  
Ne hirt hym self wiþ his owne knyff
Now han we leue to pley vs by þe lawe
Thus labowreþ he til þat þe day gan dawe
And þan he takeþ a soppe in fyne clerre
And vpriȝt in his bedde þan sitteþ he
And aftere þat he songe ful loude and clere
And kissed his wiff and made wanton chere
He was al coltissh and ful of ragerye
And ful of Girgoun as is flecked pie
  
Þe sclak skyn about his necke shakeþ
While þat he songe so chaunteþ he and crakeþ
But good woote what may þouȝt in her hert
Whan she him segh vpsitting in his shert
In his nyȝt cappe and wiþ his necke lene
She preiseth nouȝt his plesinge worþ a bene
Than seide he þus my resting wil I take
Nowe day is come I may no lenger wake
And doune he leide his hede and sclept til prime
And afterward whan þat he segh his tyme
Vp riseþ Ianuare but fresshe may
Holdeþ her chambre vnto þe ferþe day
As vsage is of wives for þe best
ffor euery laboure somtyme mot haue rest
Oyþer ellis longe may he nouȝt endure
þis is to saye no lyues creature
Be it of fissh  or brid of beest or man
Now wil I speke of woful damyan
þat languowreþ for loue as ȝe shul here
Therfore I speke to him in þis manere
I say o sely damyan allas
Answere to þis demaunde as in þis cas
Howe shalt þou to þi lady fressh May
Telle þi woo she wil alway sey nay
Eke if þowe speke she wil þi woo bywreye
God bene þine helpe I can no better seye
 This seke Damyan in Venus fire  
So brenneþ þat he deyeþ for desire
ffor whiche he putte his lif in auenture
No lenger myȝt he in þis wise endure
But priuely a penner gan he borowe
And in a letter wrote he al his sorowe
In manere of a compleint oþer a lay
Vnto þis faire and fressh lady may
And in a purs of selk hong on his shert
He haþ yputte and yleide it at his hert
  
þe mone þat at none was at thilk day
þat Ianuare haþ wedded þat fressh may
yn two of taure was in þe Cancre gliden
So longe haþ she in her chambere byden
As custumes is vnto þese nobles alle
A bride shal not eten in þe halle
Til daies foure eiþer thre daies at þe lest
Ypassed bene þan lat her goo to þe feest
þe  day complete fro none to none
whan þat the highe masse was ydone
In halle sitte þis Ianuare and may
As fresshe as is þe briȝte somers day
And so bifelle howe þat þis good man
Remembreþ hym vpon þis Damian
And seide seint mary how may þis be
That Damian entendeþ nouȝt to me
Is he ay seke or howe may þis betide
His squyers which þat stoden hym beside
Excusinge him bycause of his siknesse
Which þat letted him to do his bysynesse
None oþer cause myȝt make hym care
þat me forþenkeþ quod this Ianuare
He is a gentile squyer be my trouþe
ȝif þat he deied it were harme and rouþe
He is as wise discrete and secree
As eny man I woote of his degre
And þerto manly and eke seruisable  
And for to bene a þrifty man riȝt able
But after mete as sone as euer I may
I wil my self visite hym and eke may
To done him al þe comfort þat I can 
And for þat worde hym blessed euery man
þat of his bounte and his gentilnesse
He wolde so conforten hym in his siknesse
His squyer for it was a gentile dede
Dame quod he þis Ianuare take good hede
  
That at aftere mete ȝe wiþ ȝoure wommen alle
Whan ȝe han bene in chambre out of þis halle
That alle ȝe goon to se þis damyan
Doþ him disport he is a gentile man
And telleþ him þat I wil hym visite
Haue I no þinge but rested me a lite

Tylle þat ye slepe ffaste by my syde  
Now wiþ þat word he gan to hym calle
A sqwier þat was a marshal of his halle
And tolde him certeyn þingges what he wold
þis fresshe may haþ streight her way yhold
Wiþ all her wommen vnto þis Damyan
Doune by his beddes side satte she þan
Confortinge him as she goodly may
This Damyan whan he his tyme say
In secrete wise his purs and eke his bille
In whiche þat he writen had al his wille
Haþ putte into her honde wiþouten more
saue þat he sikked wondere sore
And softly to hure riȝt þus seide he
Mercy and þat ȝe diskeuere nouȝt me
ffor I am dede if þat þis þinge be kidde
þis purs haþe she in her bosom hidde
And went her way ȝe gete no more of me
But vnto Ianuare ycommen is she
And on his beddys side sitte ful soft
He takeþ hur an kisseþ hure ful oft
And leide hym doune to slepe and þat anōn  
She feyned hure as þoo she most gōn
Ther as she woote þat euery wiȝt mote nede
And whan she of þis bille haþ taken hede
She rent it al to cloutes at þe last
And in þe priuee softly she it cast
Who stodieth nowe but feire fresshe may
And adoune by Ianuare she lay
  
þat sclepte to þe Coughe haþ hym awaked
Anon he preide hire to stripe hur naked
He wold of hur he seide haue som plesance
He seide hire cloþes did hym encombrance
And she obeieþ be he leef or loth
But lest þat precious folk be wiþ me wroþe
How þat he wrouȝt I dar to ȝou not telle
Eiþer whedere þat he þouȝt on paradis or on helle
But I lete hem worche in her wise
Til euensonge ringe and þat þei most arise
were it be destanye eiþer be auenture
were it by influence eiþer be nature
Eiþer in constellaciōn þat in such estate
þe heuene stood þat tyme fortunate
was forto putte a bille of Venus werkes
ffor al þing haþ tyme as seine þise clerkes
To eny womman forto gete her loue
I can not seie but þe grete god aboue
That knoweþ þat none acte is causelees
He demeþ of all for I wil holde my pees
But soþ is þis howe þat þis fresshe may
Haþ take such impression þat day
On pite of þis sike Damyan
That from her hert she ne drive can
The remembraunce forto done hym eese
Certeine þouȝt she whom þat þis þing displese
I rek not for here I him assure
To loue him best of eny creature 
Though he no more nad þan his shert  
lo pite renneþ sone in gentil hert
Here may ȝe se howe excellent fraunchise
In wommen is whan þei narowe hem avise
Somme tyraunt þer is as bene mony on
That haþ an hert as hard as eny ston
Whiche wold han lete him sterue in þe place
Wel raþer þan han graunted him þat grace
  
And hem reioysen in her cruel pride
And recched nouȝt to bene an homycide
This gentile may fulfilled of al pite
Riȝt so of hure honde a lettre made she
In whiche she graunteþ hym of hire verrey grace
Ther lackeþ nouȝt only but day and space
wher þat she myȝt to his lust suffice
ffor it shal be riȝt as he wil deuise
And whan she seeghe her tyme vpon a day
To visite þis Damyan goþ faire May
And subtily þis letter doune she þrest
Vnder his pilowe rede if him lest
She takeþ him by þe hond and hard hym twist
So secrely þat no wiȝt it wist
And bad him be al hole and forþ she wente
To Ianuare whan þat he for her sente
Vp riseþ Damyan the nexte morwe
Al passed was his siknesse and his sorowe
He kembeþ him and proyneþ hym and pykeþ
He doþ al þat his lady lust and likeþ
And eke to Ianuare he goþ as lowe
As euere did a dogge for þe bowe
He is so plesaunt to euery man
ffor craft is al who þat it can
þat euery wight is fayn to teche hym good
And fully in his lady grace he stood
Thus lete I Damyan aboute his nede
And in my tale forþ I wil procede·
Somme Clerkes holden þat ffelicite  
Stant in delite and þerfor he
This noble Ianuare wiþ al his myȝt
In honest wise as longeþ to a knyȝt
Shope him to lyve ful deliciously
His howsing his aray al honestly
To his degree was maked as of kingges
Amonges oþere as of honest þingges
  
He had a gardyn walled al wiþ ston
So faire a gardyne wote I nowhere noon
ffor out of doute I verrely suppose
Þat he þat wrote þe romance of þe rose
Ne couþe of hit þe bewte wel devise
Ne priapus ne myȝt not suffice
þough he be god of gardynes forto telle
The bewte of þe gardyne and of þe welle
That stood vndere a laurere alway grene
fful ofte tyme king Pluto and his quene
Preserpyna and al her fairye
Disporten hem and maken melodye
Abouten þat welle and daunceden as men told
This noble knyght þis Ianuare þe olde
Such deynte haþ in it to walken and to pley
þat he wil suffre no wight to bere þe key
ssaue he him self for of þe smal wikett
He bare alway of siluere a clikett
Wiþ þe which whan þat hym lust vnshette
And whan þat he wold pay his wiff his dette
In somer seson þidere wold he goo
And may his wiff and no wiȝt but þei twoo
And þingges which þat were not don abedde
þei in þe gardyn perfourmed han and spedde
And in þis wise mony a mery day
Lyued þis Ianuare and fresshe may
But worldly Ioye may not alway endure
To Ianuare ne to no worldely creature
O sodeyn happe  o þou fortune vnstable  
ylike to þe scorpion uariable
þat flaterest wiþ þine heued whan þou wilt stinge
Thy tale is deþ by þine enuenemyng
O brutel ioye o swete poyson queynt
O mystery þat subtilly canst peynt
Thyne ȝiftes vndere þe hwe of stidfastnesse
þat þou desceyuedest boþ more and lesse
  
Why hast þou Ianuare þus desceyued
And haddest hym for þi ful frende receyued
And now þou hast byraft hym boþ his eyen
ffor sorowe of whiche desireth he to dyen
 Allas þe noble Ianuare þat is so fre
Amydde his lust and his prosperite
Is wexen blynde and al sodeynly
His deeþ þerfore desireþ he vtterly
And þerwiþall þe fuyre of Ielosie
Lest þat his wif shuld falle in some foly
So brent in his hert þat he wold fayn
That somme man boþe hur and hym had slayn
ffor neuere aftere his deþe ne in his liff
Ne wolde he þat she were loue ne wiff
But euere lyue as a widowe in cloþes blake
Sool as þe turtel doþ þat haþ lost her make
But at þe last after a monþe or tweye
His sorowe gan to swage soþ to seye
ffor whan he wist it may noon oþer be
He paciently toke his aduersite
Sauf out of doute may he not forgon
þat he nas Ialouse euermore in oon
Which Ialousie was so outrageous
That neiþer in halle ne in noon oþer hous 
He nolde suffre hure forto ride ne goo
Ne in noon oþer place neuer þe moo
But ȝif þat he  hande on hir alway
ffor which ful ofte wepeþ frecche may
Thal loueþ Damyan so benygnely
That she mote eiþer dey sodeynly
Or ellis she mote han him at her list  
She waiteþ whan  hert wold al tobrest
Vpon þat oþer side DAmyan
Bycommen is þe sorowfullest man
þat euer was for neiþere nyȝt ne day
Ne myght he speke a word to fresshe may
  
As to his purpoos of no suche matere
But ȝif þat Ianuare most it here
þat had oon honde vpon hir euere moo
And naþelees by writing to and froo
And priveys signes wist he what she ment
And she knewe of þe sygnes of his entent
 O Ianuare what myȝt þe availe
Thowe myȝtest se as ferre as shippes saile
ffor as good is a blynde desceyued be
As to be disceyued whan a man may see

ȝit was he blent and god woot so bene moo 
That wenen wisly þat it nys nat soo
Passe ouer is an eese and say no more
þis fresshe May of which I speke of ȝore
In warme wexe haþ enprinted þis clikett

By which vnto his gardyne of he went
And Damyan þat knewe her entent
þe Cliket countrefeted prively
þer nys no more to say but hastely
Somme wondere by þis cliket shal betide
Which ye shal here if ȝe wil abide
O noble Ovide soþe seist þou god wote
What scleȝt is it þow it be longe and hote
þat he nyl fynde it out in somme manere
By Piramus and Tisbe may men lere
þough þei were kepte ful longe streit ouerall

Ther nys no wiȝt couþe han founde out such a scleiȝt  
But nowe to purpoos er þat daies viij

That Ianuare haþ caught so grete a wille

In his gardyne and no þing but þei tweye
  
Þat in a morwe vnto his may seide he
Rise vp my wif my loue my lady free
The turtels vois is herd my douve swete
The wynter is goon with al his reynes wete
Come forþ nowe with þine eyen columbyne
How feirer bene þi brestes þan bene wyne
The gardyne is enclosed al aboute
Come forþ my white spouse out of doute

No spotte in þe nas in al þi liff
Come forþ and lat vs take our disport
I Cheese þe for my wiff and my comfort
Suche olde loude wordes vsed he

This damyan haþ opned þe wikett
And in he stert and þat in such manere
That no wiȝt myȝt it see ne here
And stille he sitte vnder a bussh anon
This Ianuare so blynde as is a ston
Wiþ Maius in his honde and no wiȝt moo
Into his fresshe gardyne is he goo
And crapte to þe wiket sodeynly
Now wif quod he here nys but þou and I
That arte þe creature þat I best loue

Þan ȝe offended dere trewe wiff

Nouȝt for no coueityse doutelees ·
But only for þe loue I had to þe  
And þough þat I be olde and may not see
Be to me trewe and I wil telle ȝou why
Certes iij þingges shul ȝe wynnen þerby
ffirst loue of Crist and to ȝoure self honour
And al myne heritage toune and toure
  
I ȝeue it ȝou makeþ Cheres as ȝou lest
This shal be doo to morowe er sonne rest
So wisly god my soule bringe in blisse
I prey ȝou in couenant þat ȝe me kisse
And þouȝe þat I be Ialous wite me nouȝt

That whan I considere ȝoure bewte
And þerwiþal þe vnlikly elde of me
I may not certes þouȝe I shulde deie
fforbere to bene out of ȝour companye
ffor verrey loue þis is wiþoute doute
Now kisse me wiff and lat vs rome aboute
 This freesshe may whan she þise wordes herd
Benignely to Ianuare she answerd
But first and formest she bygan to wepe
I haue quod she a soule to kepe
As wel as she and also myn honoure
And of my wifhede þilke tendere floure
whiche I haue assured in ȝoure hand
whan þat þe preest to ȝou my body band
wherfore I wil answere in þis manere
with þe leue of ȝou my lord so dere
I prey god þat neuere dawe þat day
þat I ne sterue as foule as womman may
If euer I do vnto my kynne þat shame
Eiþer ellis I enpeire so my name

To stripe me and putte me in a sakke
And in þe next ryuere do me drenche
I am a gentil womman and no wenche
whi speke ȝe þus but men bene euere vntrewe  
And wommen ha repreef of ȝou ay newe
Ȝe can noon oþer countynancē I leue
But speke to vs as vntrest and in repreue
And wiþ þat worde she segh wher damyan
Satte in þe busshe and knele he bygan
  
And wiþ her fynger signes made she
Þat Damyan shuld clymbe vpon a tree
Þat charged was wiþ frwte and vp he went
For verreily he knewe al her entent
And euery signe þat she couþe make
wel bette þan Ianuare her owne make
ffor in a lettre she had tolde him all
Of þis matere howe he worchen shall
And þus I lat hym sitte in þe pirry
and Ianuare and Mayus regnyng ful mery
 Briȝt was þe day and blewe þe firmament
Phebus of gold doune haþ his stremes sent
To gladen euery floure wiþ his warmnesse
He was þat tyme in Gemynys as I gesse
But litel fro his declinacion
Of Canser Iouis exaltacion
And so bifelle þat in a briȝt morowtide

Pluto þat is þe kyng of ffairye
And mony a lady in his companye
ffolowinge his wiff þe qwene proserpina
Whiche þat he rauyssshed out of proserpina
whilis þat she gadered floures in a mede
In Claudyan ȝe may þe stories rede
How in his Grisly carte he her fette
This kinge of fairye adoune hym sette
Vpon a benche of Turves fressh and grene
And riȝt anon seide he þus to his quene
My wif quod he þat may no wiȝt say nay
The experience proueth it euery day
The treson which þat womman doþ to man  
xc thousand telle I can
Notable of ȝoure vntrouþe and britelnesse
O salamon richest of alle rychesse
ffulfilled of sapience and of worldely glorie
fful worþi bene þi wordes to memorie
  
To euery wight þat witte and reson can
Thus preiseþ he ȝit þe bounte of man
Among a Ml men ȝit fonde I on
But of alle wommen fonde I neuere noon
Thus seiþ þis knyght þat knoweþ ȝoure wickednesse
And Ihesus filius Crak as I gesse
Ne spekeþ of ȝou but seelden reuerence
A wilde fuyr a corrupte pestilence
So falle vpon ȝoure bodies ȝit to nyȝt
Ne Se ȝe not þis honurable knyght
By cause alas þat he is blynde and olde
His owne man shal make him kokewold
Lo where he sitte þe leccheour in þe tree
Nowe wil I graunte of my maieste
Vnto þis olde blynde worþi knyȝt

Þat I shal ȝeuen hire suffisant answere
And alle wommen aftere for ȝoure sake
That þouȝe þei bene in eny gilt ytake

And beren hem doune þat wolden hem accuse

All hadde ȝe seie a þinge wiþ boþ ȝoure yen

And wepe and swere and chide subtily

Of mony a verrey trewe wif also 
But sir ne be not wroþ as be it soo 
þough þat he seide he foonde no good womman
I prei ȝou take þe sentence of þe man
He ment þus þat in souereyn bounte
Nis noon but god but neiþere he ne she
Eye for verrey god þat nys but oon
what make ȝe so moche of Salomon
what þouȝe he made a temple goddys hous

So made he a temple of fals goddes 
Who myȝt do a þinge þat more forbode es
Parde as faire as ȝe his name enplastere
He was a lecchoure and an ydolastre
And in his elde he verrey god forsoke
And ȝif þat god nad as seiþ þe booke

As euer mote I brouke boþ my tresses

To speke him harme þat wold vs vilanye

And I quod she a quene of fairye

Lat vs no moo wordes make

Now lat vs turne aȝein to Ianuarye
That in þis Gardyn wiþ þis faire Maye

So longe aboute þe alaies is he gon
Till he was come aȝeinst þilk piry

On hegh amonge þe fresshe leues grene
This fresshe May þat is so briȝt an shene
Gan forto sigh and seide alas my side
Now sire quod she for ouȝte þat may bytide
I moost haue of þe peeres þat I see
Or I mote dye so soore longeþ me
To eten of þe smale peres grene
Helpe for her loue þat is of heuene quene
I telle ȝou wel a womman in my plite
May haue to fruete so grete an appetite
Þat she may dyen but she it haue
Allas quod he þat I nad here a knaue
That couþe clymbe alas alas quod he

But wold ȝe vouchesauf for goddis sake

ffor wel I wote þat ȝe mystrest me
Ellis shuld I clymbe wel ynowe quod she
So I my fote myȝt sette vpon ȝoure bak
ffor soþe seide he in me shal be no lak
Might I ȝou helpe wiþ myn herte blood  
He stoupeþ doune and on his bak she stood
And cauȝt hure by a twist and vp she gooþ
Ladyes I preie ȝou þat ye be nat wrooþ
I can not glose I am a rude man
And sodeynly anoon þis damyan
  
Gan pullen vp þe smokke and in he þronge
And whan þat Pluto segh þis grete wronge
To Ianuarie he ȝaue his siȝt ageyn

And whan he hadde  cauht his syht ageyn  
ne was þer neuer man of þinge so feyn
But on his wiff his þouȝt was euermoo
Vp to þe tree he cast his eyen twoo 
And segh þat Damyan his wif had dressed
In which manere it may not be expressed
But  I wolde speke vncurteysly
And vp he ȝaue a roringe and a crye
As doþe þe modere whan þe childe shal dye
oute helpe alas harowe I gan to crye
O stronge lady stoor what doostowe
And she answereþ sire what eileth ȝowe
Haue pacience and reson in ȝoure mynde
I haue ȝou hulpen of boþ ȝoure eyen blynde
Vp perile of my soule I shal not lyen
As me was tauȝte to hele wiþ ȝoure eien
Was no þinge bette forto make ȝou see
Than strogle wiþ a man vpon a tree
God wote I did it in ful good entent
Stroggel quod he  ȝe algate in it went
God ȝeue ȝou boþe a shames deþ to dyen
He swyued þe I segh it wiþ myne eyen
And ellis be I honged by þe hals
Than is quod she þe medecyne fals
ffor certeynly if ȝe myȝten see
Ȝe wold not saye no wordes vnto me
Ȝe han some glymysing and no parfit siȝt
I see quod he as wel as euere I myȝt
Thonked be god wiþ boþ myn eyen twoo  
And by my trouþe me þought he did þe soo
Ȝe mase mase good sir quod she
This þonk I haue for I haue made ȝou see
  
Allas quod she þat euere I was so kinde
Now dame quod he lat al passe out of mynde
Come doune my leef and if I haue myssayd
God helpe me so as I am euel apayd
But by my faders soule I wend haue seyn
How þat þis Damyan had by þe leyn
And þat þi smok had leye vpon þi brest
Ȝe sir quod she ȝe may wene as ȝou lest
But sir a man þat wakeþ out of sclepe
He may not sodeynly wel take kepe
Vpon a þinge ne seen it parfitely
To þat he be adawed verrely
Riȝt so a man þat Iong haþ blynde ybe
Ne may not sodeynly so wel yse
ffirst whan þe siȝt is newe commen ageyn
As he þat haþ a day or tweyen yseyn
Til þat ȝoure siȝt ystabled be a while
Ther may ful mony a siȝt ȝou begile
Beþ ware I preye ȝou for by heuene kinge
fful mony a man weneþ forto se a þinge
And it is al anoþer þan it semeþ
He þat mysconceyueþ mysdemeþ
And wiþ þat word she lepe doun fro þe tre
This Ianuarie who is glad but he
He clippeþ hire and kisseþ hure ful oft
And on hire wombe he strokeþ hure ful soft
And to his Palays home he haþ hire lad
Nowe good men I prey ȝou to be glad
Thus endeþ here my tale of Ianuarie
God blesse vs and his modere seynt Marie
Experience thouȝe noon autorite  
were in þis world riȝt ynouȝe for me
To speke of woo þat is in mariage
ffor lordingges siþ I twelue ȝere was of age
Thonked be god þat is eterne alyue
Husbondes atte church door haue I had fyve
Ȝif I so often myȝt han wedded be
But alle were worþi men in her degre
But me was tolde certeyn not longe agon is
That siþen crist ne went neuer but onys
To wedden in þe cane of galile
þat by þilk ensample tauȝte he me
That I ne shuld wedded be but onys
Herk eek loo such a sharpe word for þe nones
Beside a welle Ihesu god and man
Spake in repreef of þe Samaritan
Thow hast yhad v husbondes quod he
And þat ilk man þat nouȝ haþ þe
Is not thyne husbond þus seide he certeyn
What he ment þerby I can not seyn
Wele But þat I aske whi the fift man
Was non husbond to þe Samaritan
How mony myȝt she han in mariage
Ȝit herd I neuere telle in myn age
  
vpon þis nombre diffinicioun
Men may devise and glosen vp and doun
But wel I wote expresse wiþouten lye
God bad us forto wexe and multiplie
That getile text can I wel vnderstond
Eke wel I wote he seide myn husbond
Shuld lete fadere and modere and take to me
But of no nombre mencion made he
Of bygamy or of octogamye
Whi shuld men þan of it han vilanye
loke here the wise man  kyng Salomon
I trowe he had wyues moo þan ōōn
Now wold god it lieful were to me  
To be refresshed half so oft as he
Which ȝift of god had he for all his wyues
No man haþ such þat in þis world alyue es 
God wote þis noble kinge as to my witte
þe furst nyȝt had mony a mery fitte
Wiþ eche of hem so wel was hym alyve
Blessed be god  þat I haue wedded fyve
Welcome þe vi whan þat euer he shal
ffor siþ I wil not kepe me chaast in all
Whan myn husbond is fro þe world ygon
Somme cristen man shal wedde me anon
ffor þan the apostel seiþ þat I am fre
To wedde a goddes half where it likeþ me
He seiþ þat to be wedded is no synne
Better is to be wedded þan to brenne
What rekkeþ me þoo folk sey vylanye
Of shrewde lameþe and his Bygamye
I woot wel Abraham was an holy man
And Iacob eke as fer as euer I can
And eche of hem had wyues moo þan twoo
And mony anoþer holy man also
Where can ȝe say in eny maner age
That vs god defended mariage
  
By expresse woord I prei ȝou telleþ me
Or where commaunded he virginite
I wote as wel as ȝe it is no drede
þe Apostel whan he spekeþ of maydenhede
He seide þerof precept had he non
Men may counsaile a womman to be on
But counseilling nys non comaundement
He putte it in oure owne Iuggement
ffor had god commaunded maidenhede
Þan had he dampned weddyng wiþ þe dede
And certes ȝif þer were no sede ysowe
Virginite þan wherof shuld it growe
Paule durst not commaunde at þe leest  
A þing of which his maister ȝaf hym no heest
þe darte is sette vp for virgynyte
Chace who so may who so renneþ best lat se
But þis word is not take of every wiȝt
But þer as god wold ȝeue it of his myght
I wote wel þat þe apostel was a mayde
But naþelees þough þat he wrote or seide
He wold þat euery wiȝt were such as he
All nys but counsaile to virgynite
And forto be a wif he ȝaf me leue
Of Indulgence so is it no repreue
To wedde me ȝif þat my make dye
Withoute excepcion of Bygamye
Al were it good no womman forto touche
He ment as his body · or in his couche
ffor perile is boþ fire and towe to assemble
Ȝe knowe what þis ensample may resemble
þis is al and somme he helde virginite
More parfit þan wedded in freelte
Freelte clepe I not but þat he and she
Wolde lede her lif al in chaastite
I graunte it wel I haue non envie
þoo Maidenhede preferre bygamye
  
It likeþ hem to be clene in body and goost
Of myn estaat I wil make no boost
ffor wel ȝe knowe a lord in his houshold
Haþ not euery vessel of gold
Somme bene of tree and don her lord seruise
God clepeþ folk to him in sondry wise
And euery haþ of god a propre ȝift
Somme þis somme þat as hym likeþ shift
Virginite ys grete perfeccion
And continence eke wiþ deuociōn
But crist þat of perfeccion is welle
Bad not euery wiȝt he shulde selle
Al þat he had and ȝeue it to þe poore  
And in such wise folowe hym and his lore
He spake to hem þat wold lyue parfitely
And lordingges by ȝoure leue þat am not I
I wil bystowe þe floure of al myn age
In charite and fruyte of mariage
Telle me also to what conclusion
Were membres made of generacion
And of so parfit wise and whi ywrouȝt
Tresteþ riȝt wel þei were not made for nouȝt
Glose who so wil I say boþ vp and doun
þat þei were made for purgacioun
Of vryne and oure boþe þingges smale
were eke to knowe a female from a male
And for noon oþer cause  what seye ȝe no
þe experience woot þat it is so 
So þat þe clerkes ben not wiþ me wrooþ
I seie þis þat þei maked be fore both
This is to seyne for office and for eese
Of engendringe ther we not god displese
whi shuld men ellis in her bokes sette
þat man shal ȝelde to his wif his dette
Nowe wherwiþ shuld he paye his payment
Ȝif þat he ne vsed his sely instrument
  
Than were þei made vpon a creature
To purge vryne and eke for engendrure
But I seye not þat euery wiȝt is holde
Þat haþ such harneys as I to ȝou haue tolde
To goon and vsen hem in engendrure
þan shuld men take of chastite no cure
Crist was a mayde and shapen as a man
And mony a seint siþ þat þe world bygan
Ȝit lyued þei euere in parfit chaastite
I nyl envie wiþ no virginite
Lat hem ete brede of pured whete sede
And lat vs wyues ete Barle brede
And ȝit wiþ barle brede Mark telle can  
Oure lord Ihesu refresshed mony a man
In such astate as god haþ cleped vs 
I wil perseuere I ne am not precious
In wifhode wil I vse myn Instrument
As frely as my maker haþ it sent
If I be daungerous god ȝeue me sorowe
Myn husbonde shal it haue boþ eue and morowe
Whan þat him list come forþ and paye his dette
An husbond I wil han I nyl not lette
Which shal be boþ my dettour and my þral
And han his tribulacion wiþall
Vpon his flessh while þat I am his wiff
I haue the power during al my liff
vpon his propre body and not he
Riȝt þus þe apostel told  vnto me
And bad oure husbondes forto loue hym well
Al þis sentence me likeþ euery dell
Vp stert the pardonere and þat anon
Now dame quod he by god and by seynt Iohn
Ȝe bene a noble precheour in þis caas
I was about to wedde a wiff alas
What shuld I by it on my flessh so dere
Ȝit had I leuer wedde non to ȝere
  
Ibyde quod she my tale is not bygonne
Nay þou shalt drinken a noþer tonne
Er þat I goo shal sauour wors þan ale
And whan þat I haue told forþ my tale
Of tribulacion in mariage
Of whiche I am expert in myn age
þis is to seye my silf haþ bene þe whippe
þan maist þowe chese whider þou wilt scippe
þilk tonne þat I shal abroche
Be war of it or þou to nye aproche
ffor I shal telle ensamples moo þan ten
who that wil not be war by oþere men 
By hym shul oþer men corrected be  
Thise same wordes writeþ ptholome
Rede in his almagest and take it þere
Dame I wold prey ȝou if ȝour wille were
Seide þis pardonere as ȝe bygan
Telle forþ ȝoure tale spare for no man
And teche vs ȝenge men of ȝoure practyke
Gladly quod she siþ it may ȝou like
But þat I prey to al þis companye
If þat I speke after my fantasie
As takeþ nat a greef of þat I seye
For myn entent is not but to pleye
 Now sirs þan shal I telle ȝou my tale
As euere mote I drinke wyne or ale
I shal seie soþ þoo husbondes þat I hadde
As iij of hem were good and two were badde
þe iij were good men riche and olde
Vnneþes myȝten þei þe statute holde
In which þei were bounden vnto me
Ȝe wote wele what I mene of þis parde
As god me helpe I laugh whan I þenke
How pitously a nyȝt I made hem swynke
But by my faye I tolde of it no store
þei had me ȝoue her londe and her tresore
  
Me neded not do lenger diligence
To wynne her loue and do hem reuerence
þei loued me so wel by god aboue
þat I ne told no deynte of her loue
A wise womman wil bysy hure euere in on
To gete her loue ȝe þer as she haþ non
But siþe I had hem holy in myn honde
And siþ þat þei hadde ȝoue me al her londe
what shuld I take kepe hem forto plese
But ȝif it were my profite and myn ease
But sette hem so a werke by my faye
þat mony a nyȝt þei songen weleaway
The bacon was not fette for hem I trowe  
þat somme men han in Essex at donmowe
I gouerned hem so wel after my lawe
þat eche of hem ful blisful was and fawe
To bringe me gay þingges fro þe feire
knyves and ryngges and purses wel faire
ffor god it woot I chide hem spitously
Now herkeneþ how I bere me proprely
Ȝe wise wyues þat can vnderstond
þus shuld ȝe speke and bere hem wrong on hond
ffor half so boldely þer can no man
Swere and lye as womman can
I say not þis by wyues þat bene wise
But it be whan þat þei hem mysavise
A wise wif shal if þat she can her goode
Bere him an honde þat þe kowe is wode
And take witnesse of hire owne mayde
Of hure assent but harkeneþ how I seide
 Sire olde keynard is þis þine aray
whi is my neighboures wif so gay
She is honoured oueral wher she goþe
I sitte at home I haue no þrifty cloþe
what dostowe at myn neighbours hous
Is she so faire art þou so amerous
  
what roune ȝe wiþ our mayde  benedicite
Sire olde lecchoure lat þi Iapes be
And if I haue a gossipe or a frende
wiþoute gilt ȝe chide as a fende
Ȝif þat I walk or play vnto his hous
Þou commest home as dronken as a mous
An prechest on þi benche wiþ euel preef
Þou seist to me it is a grete meschief
To wedde a poor womman for costage
And if þat she be riche of grete parage
þan seist þou þat it is a turmentrie
To suffre her pride and her malencolie
And if þat she be faire þowe verrey knaue  
þowe seist þat euery holoure wol hure haue
She may no while in chaastite abide
That is assaied vpon eche side
Thowe seist somme folk desire vs for richesse
Somme for our shap and some for our fairnesse
And somme for she can eiþer sing or dance
Thus seistowe wernard god ȝeue þe meschance
Somme for hure hondes and her armes smale
Thus goþ al to þe deuell by þi tale
Thow seyst men may not kepe a castell walle
It may so longe assailled be ouerall
And if þat she be foule þou saist þat she
Coveiteþ euery man þat she may se
ffor as a spaynel she wil on hym lepe
Til þat she fynde somme man þat wil hire chepe
Ne noon so grey goos gos þer in the lake
As seist þou þat wil be wiþouten make
And seist it is an harde þinge forto welde
A wiȝt þat no man wil his þonkes helde
Thus seist þou lorel whan þou goost to bedde
And þat no wise man nedeþ forto wedde
And no man þat entendeþ to þe heuene
with wilde þonder dynt and fire leuene
  
Mote þi welked nek be tobroke
þou seist þat dropping houses and eke smoke
And chidinge wyues maken men to fle
Out of hir owne house A benedicite
What eileþ such an old man forto chide
þou seist we wyues wil oure vices hide
Til we be fast and þan we wil hem schewe
Wele may þis be a prouerbe of a schrewe
þou seist þat Oxen assen hors and houndes
þei ben assaide at dyuers stoundes
Basyns lauoyrs er þat men hem bye
Spones stooles and such husbondrye
And so bene pottes cloþes and oþer araies  
But of wommen are maked none assaies
Til þei ben wedded old dotard shrewe
And seist howe þen we will our vices shewe
Thowe seist also þat it displeseþ me
But ȝif þou wilt preise my bewte
And but þou poure alway vpon my face
And clepe me faire dame in euery place
And but þou make a feest on þat ilk day
þat I was born and make fressh and gay
And but þou do to myn norys honoure
And to my chambere withInne my bour
And to my faders folkes and his alyes
Thus seist þou olde barell ful of lyes
And ȝit of oure apprentise Iankyn
ffor his crispe here shynyng as gold fyne
And for he sqwiers me boþ vp and doun
Ȝit hast þou þouȝt a fals suspecioun
I wil hym not þei þou were dede tomorowe
But telle me þis whi hidest þou wiþ sorowe
þi keyes of þi chest away fro me
It is my good as wel as þine parde
what wenest þou make an ydyote of our dame
Now by þat lord þat called is seint Iame
  
þou shalt not boþ þouȝe þou were woode
Be maister of my body and my goode
þat oon þou shalt forgoen magre þine eiȝen
what helpeþ it of me to quere and spien
I trowe þoo þou woldest lokke me in þi chest
þou shuldest seie wif go where þe lest
Take ȝoure disport I wil leue no talis
I knowe ȝou for a good wiff dame Alys
we loue no man þat takeþ kepe ne charge
where þat we go we wil be at our large
Of alle men blessed mot he be
þe wise astrologen daun ptholome
That seiþ þis prouerbe in his almagest  
Of alle men his wisdom is hiest
þat rekkeþ not who haþ þe world in hond
By þis prouerbe þou shalt wel vnderstond
Haue þou ynowe what ther þe rekke and care
Howe merely þat oþere folk fare
ffor certes olde dotarde be ȝoure leue
Ȝe shul haue queynt right ynowe at eue
He is to grete a nygard þat wil warne
A man to liȝt a candel at his lantarne
He shal haue neuere þe lasse liȝt parde
Haue þou ynowe þe ther not pleyn þe
Thou seist also þat ȝif þou make vs gay
with cloþinge or wiþ precious aray
That it is perile of our chaastie
And ȝit wiþ wordes þou mote enforce me
And say þise wordes in þe apostels name
In abite made wiþ chastite and shame
Ȝe wommen shuld apparaile ȝou quod he
And not in tressed here and gay perre
As perle ne wiþ gold and cloþes riche
Aftere þi text ne aftere þi rubriche
I nyl not worche as mochel as a gnatte
Thowe seidest als þat I was like a catte
  
But who so wolde senge a cattis skyn
þan wold þe catte wel dwellen in his Inn
And if þe cattes skyn be sclyke and gay
She nyl not dwel in hous half a day
But forþ she wil er eny day be dawed
To shewe her skyn and go a caterwawed 
þis to seie if I be gay sir schrewe
I wil renne out my burel for to shewe
Sir olde foole what helpeþ þe to spien
þei þowe prey argus wiþ his Ml eyen
To be my warde corps as he can best
In feiþ he shal not kepe me but if me lest
Ȝit couþe I make his beerde so mote I þee  
þou seist eke þat þer bene þinges þre
Þe which þingges trowblen al þis erþe
And þat no wiȝt ne may endure þe ferþe
O leue sir schrewe Ihesu short þi liff
Ȝit prechestowe and seist an hatful wiff
Yreckned is for oon of þise meschaunces
Ben þere non oþer manere resemblaunses
þat ȝe may likne ȝoure parables too
But ȝif a cely wif be oon of þoo
þow  liknest wommannys loue to helle
To barayn londe þer water may not dwelle
Thou liknest it also to wilde fire
Þe more it brenneþ þe more it haþ desire
To consume eny þing þat brent wold be
Thow seist þat riȝt a wormes sheende a tre
Riȝt so a wiff distroieþ her husbonde
þis knowe þei þat bene to wyues bonde
 Lordingges riȝt þus as ȝe han hunderstand
Bare I stifly myn olde husbondes on hand
That þus þei seiden in her dronkenesse
And eke þat þei had suspecion of Ialousnesse
On Iankin and on myn neef also
O lord þe peyn I did hem and þe woo 
  
fful giltelees by goddis swete pyne
ffor as an hors I couþe boþ bite and whyne
I couþe pleyn and I was in þe gilt
Or ellis often tyme I had be spilt
Who so þat first to mylle commeth first grynt
I pleyned furst so was oure werre stint
 þei were ful glad to excusen hem ful blyue
Of þinge of which þei agilt neuer her lyue
Of wenches wold I beren hem on honde
Whan þat for seke þei myȝt vnneþ stonde
Ȝit ticled I his hert for þat he
wende I had of hym so grete chierte
I swore þat al my walking by nyȝt  
Was forto aspie wenches þat he diȝt
Vnder þat colour had I mony a myrþe
ffor al such witte is ȝeuen vs in our birþe
Deceyte weping spynnyng god haþ ȝeue
To womman kindely while þat þei lyue
And þus of on þing I auaunte me
At þe ende I had þe best in eche degre
By sleiȝt or force or by somme maner þinge
As by contynuel murmur or grucchinge
Namely abed had þei meschaunce
þer wold I chide and do hem no plesaunce
I wolde no lenger in þe bedde abide
Ȝif þat I felt his arme ouere my side
Til he had made his raunson vnto me
þan wolde I suffre hym doo his nicete
And þerfore euery man þis tale I telle
Wiue who so may al are for to selle
With empty hond men may non hauke lure
ffor wynnyng wold I al his lust endure
And make me a feyned appetite
And ȝit in bacon had I neuere delite
That maked me þat euer I wold hym chide
ffor þouȝe þe pope had sitte hym beside
  
I wolde not spare hym at his owne bord
ffor be my trouþe I quytte hym worde for word
As helpe me verrey god omnipotent
þow I riȝt nowe shuld make my testament
I ne owe hym a word þat it nys quytte
I brouȝt it so aboute by my witte
Þat he must ȝeue it vp as for þe best
Or ellis had we neuer be in rest
ffor þough he loked as a lyon
Ȝit shuld he faile of his conclusion
Than wold I seie nowe goode leef take kepe
Howe mekely lokeþ wilkin our shepe
Come nere my spouse lat me ba þi cheke  
Ȝe shul be al pacient and meke
And han a swete spiced conscience
Siþ ȝe so prech of Iobes pacience
Suffreþ alway siþ ȝe so wel can preche
And but ȝe doo certeyn we shul ȝou teche
þat it is faire to haue a wif in pees
Oon of vs mote bowen doutelees
And siþ a man is more resonable
þan womman is sir ȝe moste be suffrable
what eileth ȝou to grucche þus and grone
Is it for ȝe wold han my queynt alone
Wy take it alle lo haue it euery dell
Peter I schrewe ȝou but ȝe loue me well
ffor ȝif I wolde selle my bele chose
I couþe walk as frecch as eny rose
But I wil kepe it for ȝour owne toth
Ȝe be to blame be god I seie ȝou soth
Such manere wordes had we on hond
Now wil I speke of my ferþe husbonde
 Mi ferþe husbonde was a reueloure
þis is to seie he had a paramour
And I was ȝenge and ful of ragerye
Stiborn and stronge and Ioly as a pie
  
lord I couþe daunce to an harpe smale
And synge ywis as eny nyȝtingale
whan I hadde dronke a draught of swete wyn
Metelyus þe foule cheerle þo swyn
þat wiþ a staf byraft his wif her lif
ffor she dronk wyne þouȝe I had ben his wiff
Ne shuld he not han daunted me fro drinke
And aftere wyne on venus most I þenke
ffor as siker as colde engendreþ haile
A likerous mouþ most han a lykerous tale
In womman vinolent is no defence
þis knowe lecchours by experience
But lord crist whan þat it remembreþ me  
Vpon my ȝouþe and  my Iolite
It ticleþ me aboute myn herte rote
Vnto þis day It doþ myn herte bote
þat I haue had my world as in my tyme
But age alas þat al wil enuenyme
Haþ me byraft my bewte and my pith
Lat it go fare wel þe deuel goo þerwith
The floure is gon þer nys no more to telle
þe bren as I best can now mote I selle
But ȝit to be riȝt mery wil I foonde
Now forþe to telle of my ferþe husbonde
I seie I had in hert gret despite
þat he of eny oþer had delite
But he was quytte by god and by seynt Iose
I made hym of þe same wode a crose
Nat of my body in no foule manere
But certeynly I made folk such chere
þat in his owne grece I made hym frye
ffor Anger and for verrey Ialowsie
By god in erþe I was his purgatorie
ffor which I hope his saule be in glorie
ffor god it woote he satte ful oft and songe
whan þat his shogh ful bitterly hym wronge
  
ffor þer nas noon sauf god and he þat wist
In mony wise where I hym twist
He deyed whan I come fro Ierusalem
And liþe in a graue vnder þe rodebeem
All nys his tombe not so curious
As was þe sepulture of hym darius
which þat appelles wrouȝt subtily
It nys but waast to bury hym preciously
Lat hym fare wel god ȝeue his soule rest
He is nowe in his graue and in his chest
 Nowe of my v husbond wil I telle
God lat neuere his soule come in helle
And ȝit was he to me þe moost shrewe  
þat fele I on my ribbes al by rewe
And euere shal unto myn ending daye
But in oure bed he was so fressh and gaye
And þer wiþ al so wel couþe he me glose
whan þat he wold han my bele chose
þat þouȝe he had me bete on euery bon
He couþe wynne ageyn my loue anon
I trowe I loued him þe bette for he
Was of his loue daungerous to me
We wommen han if þat I shal not lye
In þis manere a queynte fantasie
waite what þinge we may not liȝtly haue
Theraftere wil we crie al day and craue
fforbede vs þinge and þat desiren we
Prees on vs fast and þan wil we fle
with daungere outer we al oure chaffare
Greet prees atte Market makeþ dere ware
And to grete chepe is yholde atte litel pris
This knoweþ euery womman þat is wise
 My fift husbonde god his soule blisse
which þat I toke for loue and no ricchesse
he some tyme was a clerk of oxenford
And had left scole and went at home to boord
  
wiþ my gossip dwelling in our toūn
God haue her soule her name was alisoun
She knewe myn hert and al my priuyte
Better þan oure parissh preest so mot I the
To hure bywried I my counseil all
ffor had myn husbonde pissed on a walle
Or doon a þinge þat shuld have cost his liff
To hure and to anoþer worþi wiff
And to my nece which I loue well
I wold han tolde his counseile eueridell
And so I did ful often god it wote
þat made his face often rede and hote
ffor verrey shame and blamed hym self for he  
had tolde to me so grete a privyte
And so byfelle þat ones in a lente
So ofte tyme I to my gosype wente
ffor euere ȝit I loued to be gay 
And forto walke in marche Averil and may
ffrom hous to hous to harken sonday tailes
þat Iankin clerk and my gossip dame alys
And I my self into þe feeldes wente
Myn husbonde was at london al þat lente
I had þe bettre leisere forto pley
And forto see and eke forto be seye
Of lusty folk what wist I wher my grace
Was shapen forto be or in what place
Therfore made I my visitacions
To vigiles and to processions
To preching eke and to þise pilgrimages
To plaies of miracles and of mariages
And wered vpon my gay scarlet gites
Thise wormes ne þise mothes ne þise mytes
Vpon my perile frete hem neuer a dele
And woostowe whi for þei were vsed wele
Now wil I tellen forþ what happed me
I seie þat in þe feeldes walked we
  
Til trewely we had such daliance
þis clerk and I þat of my purviance
I spake to hym and seide how þat he
ȝif I were widowe shuld wedde me
ffor certeynly I seye for no bobance
þat I was neuere ȝit withoute purveance
Of mariage ne of oþer þingges eke
I hold a monnys witte nat worþ a leke
Þat haþ but oon hool forto stirten too
And ȝif þat faile þan is al ydoo 

My dame taughte me þat subtylte
And eke I sayde I Mete of hym all nyghte
He wolde haue slayne Me As I laye vprighte
And all my bedde was ffulle of vereye blode
Butte yette I hope þat ye schull do me gode
ffor blode bitokeneþe golde As me was taughte
And all was ffalse I dremede of hitt righte noughte
Butte as I ffollowede Ay My dames lore
Aswelle of that as of oþer þynge more
But nowe Sir lat me se what shal I seyn
A A by god I haue my tale ageyn
whan þat my ferþ husbond was on bere  
I wepte algates and made sory chere
As wyues moten for it is þe vsage
And with my keercheef keuered my visage
But for þat I was purueide of a make
I wepte but smale and þat I vndertake
To church was myn husbond yborn on morowe
wiþ neighbours þat for hym made sorowe
And Iankyn our clerk was on of þoo
As helpe me god whan þat I segh hym goo
Aftere þe bere me þouȝt he had a peire
Of legges and of fete so clene and feire
Þat al my hert I ȝaue vnto his holde
He was I trowe xxti wynter olde
  
And I was xlti ȝif I shal seie soþe
But ȝit I had alway a Coltissh toþe
Gat toþed I was and þat bycam me well
I had þe printe of seynt venus seell
As helpe me god I was a lusty on
ffaire and riche ȝonge and welbygon
And trewly as myn husbond tolde me
I had þe best quoniam þat myȝt be

In ffelenges And my herte is Mercyen
Venus me yafe My luste my lykerousnesse
And Mars yafe me my sturdye hardynesse  
Myn ascendent was taure and mars þerinne
Allas alas þat euer loue was synne
I folowed aye myn Inclinacion
By vertue of my constellacion
That made me I couþe not wiþdrawe
My chambere of venus from a good felawe

And allso in Anoþere preuye place
ffor god so wysse be My saluacion
I louede neuer by no discrecion
I ffollowede euer Myne Appetyte
All were he longe schorte blacke or whyte
I toke no kepe so þat he lykede me
How poure he was And eke of whatte degre
What shuld I sei but at þe monþes ende
This Ioly clerk Iankyn þat was so hende
Haþ wedded me wiþ grete solempnite
And to hym ȝaue  al þe londe and ffee
þat euere was me ȝeuen þerbifore
But aftere repented me ful sore·
He nolde suffre no þinge of my lest
by god he smote me onys on þe lest
ffor þat I rent out of his boke a leef  
That of þat stroke myn eeren wexen deef
  
Stiborn I was as is a leonesse
And of my tunge a verrey Iangeleresse
And walk I wold as I had don toforn·
ffrom hous to hous al þouȝe he had it sworn
fforþwiþ ful often tyme he wolde preche
And me  olde Romaynes geestes teche
How he· symplicius gallus laft his wiff
And hure forsoke for terme of his lif
Nat but for open hede he hure say
Lokinge out at his door on a day
Anoþer romayn tolde he me by name
þat for his wiff was at a somers game
Wiþoute his wittyng he forsoke her eke
And þan wolde he vpon his bible seke
þat ilk prouerbe of Ecclesiast
Where he commaundeþ and forbedeþ fast
Man shal not suffre his wif to rome aboute
Than wolde he seie riȝt þus wiþouten doute
Whoso þat beeldeþ his hous all of salous
And prickeþ his blynde hors ouere þe falous
And suffereþ his wif forto seken halowes
Is worþi forto be honged on þe galowes 
 But al for nouȝt I sette not an hawe
Of his prouerbes ne of his olde lawe
Ne I wold not of hym corrected be
I hate hym þat my vice telleþ me
And so don moo god wote of vs þan I
þis made him wiþ me wode al vtterly
I nold forbere hym in no cas
Now wil I seye ȝou soþ by seint Thomas
Whi þat I rent out of his booke a leef
ffor which he smote me þat I was deef
He had a boke þat gladly nyȝt and daye
ffor his disport he wolde rede alway
He cleped Valerye and theofraste  
Atte whiche boke he lowgh alway ful fast
  
And eke þer was somtyme a clerk in Rome
A Cardynal þat hight seint Ierome
Þat made a boke aȝein Iouean
In which boke eke þer was Terculan
Crisippus Trocula and holowys
That was Abbas not fer fro Paris
And eke þe parables of Salomon
Ovydes art and bokes mony on
And alle þise were bounden in oo volom
And euery nyȝt and day was his custom
Whan he had leisere and vacacion
ffrom oþere worldly occupacion
To reden in þis boke of wicked wyues
He knewe of hem mo legendys þan lyues
þan bene of good wyues in þe bible
ffor trusteþ wel it is an impossible
þat eny clerk wil speken good of wyues
But ȝif it be of holy seyntes lyues
Ne of noon oþere womman neuere þe moo 
who peinted þe lyon telle me who 
By god ȝif wommen had ywriten stories
As clerkes han wiþIn her oratories
Thei wold han writen of men more wickednesse
Than al þe Mark of Adam may redresse
The Children of mercury and Venus
Ben in her worchinge contrarious 
Mercury loueþ wisdom and science
And Venus loueþ riote and dispence
And for her dyuers disposicion
Ech falleþ in oþer exaltacion
As þus god wote mercure is disolate
In pisces wher Venus is exaltate
And Venus falleþ þer mercurye is reysed
þerfor no womman of no man is preised
The clerk whan he is olde and may not do  
Of Venus werkes worþ his olde shoo
  
þan sitte he doun and writte in his dotage
Þat wommen can not kepe her mariage
But nowe to purpoos whi I told þe
Þat I was beten for a boke parde
Vpon a nyȝt Iankin þat was our sire
Redde on his boke as he satte by þe fire
Of Eua first þat for her wickednesse
Was al mankinde brouȝt to wrecchednesse

That boughte vs with his herte blode agayne
Lo here expresse of women Maye ye ffynde
That women was the losse of All Mankynde  
Tho redde he me howe sampson lost his heres
Slepinge his lemman kitt it wiþ her sheres
þourgh whiche treson lost he boþ his eyen 
Tho redde he me if I shal not lyen
Of Ercules and of his dyanyre
þat caused hym to sette hym self a fyre
No þinge forgate he þe penaunce and woo
þat Socrates had wiþ his wyues twoo
Howe þat Ancipa cast pisse on his hede
þe Sely man satte stille as he were dede
He wiped his hede no more durst he seyn
But er þat thonder stint commeþ a reyn
Of pasipa þat was þe quene of grete
ffor schrewdenesse hym þouȝt þe tale swete
ffye speke no more it is a grisly þinge
Of hure horrible lust and  lykynge
Of Clitermistra for her lecherye
þat falsly made her husbond forto dye
He redde it wiþ ful good deuocion
He tolde me for what occasion
Amphiorax at thebes lost his lif
Myn husbonde had a legende of his wif
Eriphilem þat for an ouch of gold
haþ prively vnto þe grekes told
  
wher þat her husbond hidde hym in a place
ffor which he had at Thebes sory grace
Of lyma tolde he mee and of lucye  
Þei boþ made her husbondes forto dye
Thatt on for loue þat oþer was for hate
lyma her husbonde on euene late
Enpoysened had for þat she was his foo
Lucia lykerous loued her husbond soo 
Þat for he shuld vpon her alway þinke
She ȝaue hym such a loue manere drinke
That he was dede or it was by þe morowe
And þus algates husbondes han sorowe
 Than tolde he me howe on latumyus
Compleyned to his felawe arius
That in his gardyne growed such a tre
On which he seide þat his wyues þre
Hangged hem selue for hertes despitous
O leue broþer quod þis arious
Ȝeue me a plant of þat blisful tre
And in my gardyne planted shal he be
Of latter date of wyues haþ he redde
þat han sclayn her husbondes in þe bedde
But lat hure lecchoure diȝt hur al þe nyȝt
Whan þat þe corps lay in þe floore vpriȝt
And some han dryuen nayles in her brayn
While þat þei sclepe and þus þei han hem sclayn
Somme han ȝeuen poysen in her drinke
He spak more harme þan hert may þenk
And þerwithall he knewe of moo prouerbes
þan in þis world þer growen grasse or herbes 
Bett is quod he þine habitacion
Be wiþ a leon or a foule dragon
Þan wiþ a womman vsing forto chide
Bet is quod he high in þe roof abide
þan wiþ an angry wif doun in an hous
þey bene so wicked and contrarious 
  
þei haten þat her husbondes louen ay
He seide a womman cast her shame away
whan she cast of her smokke and ferþermo  
A faire womman but she be chaast also 
Is lich a gold rynge on a sowes nose
who wold wene or wold suppose
The woo þat in myn herte was and pyne
And whan I segh he wolde neuere fyne
To reden on þis cursed boke al nyȝt
Al sodeynly þre leues haue I pliȝt
Out of his boke riȝt as he redde and eke
I wiþ my fist so toke him on þe cheke
That in our fire he fille bakward adoun
And he vp stert as doþ a wood lyoun
And wiþ his fist he smote me on þe hede
Þat in þe flore I laie as I were dede
And whan he seegh how stille þat I lay
He was agast and wold han fledde away
Til at þe laste out of my swowe I breide
O hastowe sclayne me fals þeef I seide
And for my londe þus hastowe mordred me
Or I be dede ȝit wil I kisse þee
And nere he come and kneled faire adoun
And saide dere sustere Alisoun
As helpe me god I shal þe neuere smyte
That I haue done it is þi self to wite
fforȝeue it me and þat I þe biseke
And ȝit eftsones I hit hym on þe cheke
And seide þeef þus moche am I wreke
Nowe wil I dye I may no lenger speke
But at þe last wiþ mochel care and woo
We fille acorded by vs seluen twoo
He ȝaue me al þe bridel in myn honde
To haue þe gouernaunce of hous and londe
And of his tunge and his hand also
And made him brenne his boke anon riȝt þoo
  
And whan þat I had goten vnto me
By maistery al þe souereynte
Than he seide myn owne trewe wif  
Do as ȝou lest þe terme of al ȝoure lif
kepe ȝoure honure and kepe eke myn astate
Aftere þat day we had neuere debate
God helpe me so I was to him as kinde
As eny wiff from denmarke into Ynde
And also trewe  and so was he to me
I prey to god þat sitte in mageste
So blesse his soule for his mercy dere
Now wil I seie my tale if ȝe wil here
The frere lowe whan he had herd al þis
Now dame quod he so haue I ioye or blis
þis is a longe preamble of a tale
And whan þis somnour herd þe frere gale
Lo quod þe somnour goddis armes two
A frere wil entremete hym euermoo
Loo good men a flie and eke a frere
wollen falle in euery dissh and eke matere
what spekest þou of preambulacioun

Thou lettest oure disport in þis manere
Ȝe wilt þou so somnour quod þe frere
Now by my fay I shal er þat I goo
Telle a somnour such a tale or twoo
That alle þe folk shul laughen in þis place
Now ellis frere I bishrewe þi face
Quod þis somnour and I bishrewe me
But ȝif I telle þe tales two or þre
Of freres er I come to sidyngburne
þat I shal make þine hert for to mourne
  
ffor wel I wote þi pacience is gon
Our hoost cried pees and þat anon
And seide lat þe womman telle her tale
Ȝe faren as folk þat dronken ben of ale
Do dame telle forth ȝour tale þat is þe best  
Al redy sire quod she riȝt as ȝou lest
If I haue licence of þis worþi frere
ȝis dame quod he telle forþ ȝoure tale we wil here
IN þe olde dayes of þe king arthour
Of which þat bretons speken grete honour
Al was þis land fulfilled of fayry
þe Elfe quene wiþ her Ioly companye
Daunced wiþ out in mony a grene mede
Þis was þe olde opynyon as I rede
I speke of mony an C ȝere agoo
But nowe can no man se noon elues moo
ffor nowe þe grete charite and preiers
Of lymytoures and oþer poor freres
That serchen euery londe and euery streme
As þikke as motes in þe sonne beme
Blessinge halles chambers and boures
Citiees burghes castels hiȝe toures
Thropes  beernys  shipnes  dayrys
This makeþ þat þer bene no fayrys
ffor þer as wonte to walke was an elf
Ther walkeþ nowe þe lymytour hym self
In vnder meles and in mornyngges
And seiþ his matyns and his holy þingges
As he goþ in his lymitacioun
Wommen may go nowe sauf vp and doun
In euery bussh or vnder euery tre
Þer nys non oþer Incubus but he
And he wil do hem but dishonour
And so felle it þat þis king Arthour
Had in his hous a lusty bachilere
That on a day come riding fro ryvere
  
And happed alone as she was born
He seegh a maiden walking hym byforn
Of which mayde Maugre her hede
By verrey force he raft hure maydenhede
ffor which oppression was such clamour  
And such pursute vnto þe king arthour
That dampned was þis knyȝt forto be dede
Be cours of lawe and shuld haue lost his hede
Perauenture such was þe statute þoo 
But þat þe quene and oþer ladis moo
So longe preide þe kinge of grace
Til he his liff him graunted in þat place
And ȝaue hym to þe quene al at her wille
To chese whedere she wold hym saue or spille
The quene þonkeþ þe kinge wiþ al her myȝt
And after þis þus speke she to þe knyght
Whan þat she seegh her tyme on a day
Thou stondest ȝit quod she in such aray
That of þi lif ȝit hastowe no suerte
I graunte þe lif if þou canst telle me
 What þing is it þat wommen most desiren
Be ware and kepe þi nekbone fro yren
And if þou canst not telle it me anon
Ȝit wil I ȝeue þe leue forto gon
A xij monþe and a daye  to seke and lere
An answere suffisaunt in þis matere
And suerte wil I han er þat þou passe
Þi body forto ȝelde in þis place
woo was þis knyȝt and sorowfully he sikeþ
But what he may not do al as hym likeþ
And at þe last he chese hym forto wende
And to come aȝein riȝt at þe ȝeres ende
With suche answere as god wold hym purveye
And takeþ his leue and wendeþ forþ his weye
He sekeþ euery hous and euery place
Where as he hopeþ forto fynde grace
  
To lere what þing wommen louen most
But he nowe koude aryuen in no cost
where as he myȝte fynde in þis matere
Twoo creatures acording in fere
Somme seiden wommen louen best ricchesse  
Somme seide honour somme seiden Iolynesse
Somme riche aray  some seiden lust a bedde
And oft tyme to be wydowe and wedde
Somme seiden þat we bene most yesed
Whan þat we bene yflatered and yplesed
He goþ ful ny þe soþ I wil nat lye
A man shal wynne vs best wiþ flaterye
And wiþ attendaunce and wiþ bisynesse

And somme men seyn howe þat we louen best
fforto be free and do riȝt as vs lest
And þat no man repreue vs of our vice
But say þat we bene wise and no þinge nice
ffor trewly þer nys noon of vs alle
Ȝif eny wiȝt wil clawe vs on þe galle
Þat we nyl loke or he saye vs soth
Assaie and he shal fynde it þat he doþ
ffor be we neuer so vicious wiþInne
We wil be holden wise and clene of synne
And somme seyn þat grete delit haue we

And in oo purpos stedfastly to dwelle
And not bewrey þing þat men vs telle
But þat tale is not worþ a rake stele
Parde we wommen connen no þing hele
Witnesse on myda wil ȝe here þe tale
Ovide amonges oþer þingges smale
Seiþ Mida had vnder his longe heres
Growinge vpon his hede two asses eres
The whiche vice he hidde as he best myȝt
fful subtily from euery mannys siȝt
  
þat saue his wif þer wist it no moo
He loued her most and trested to her also
He preide hir most þat vnto no creature
She shuld not tellen of his disfigure
She swore hym nay for al þis world to wynne  
She wold do þat vilanye or þat synne
To make her husbond han so foule a name
ffor reprevynge of hym and foule shame
But naþelees her þouȝt þat she dide
þat she so longe shuld a counseile hide
Her þouȝt it satte so sore about her herte
Þat nedely som word her mote asterte
And siþe she durst  tellen it no man
Doune to a marise fast she ranne
Til she came þere her herte was a fire
And as a bitor bumleþ in þe myre
She laide her mouþ vnto þe water doun
Bewrey me not þou watere wiþ þi soun
Qooþ she to þe I telle it and no moo
Myn husbonde haþ longe asses eren two
Now is my hert al hole now is it oute
I myȝt no lenger kepe it out of doute
Here may ȝe se þouȝe we a tyme abide
Ȝete oute it moot we mowe no counseil hide
The remenaunte of þe tale if ȝe wil here
Redeþ ovide and ȝe mowe it lere
 This knyȝt of which my tale is specialy
Whan þat he seegh he myȝt not come þerby
This is to seyn what wommen louen most
Wiþin his hert soryful was þe goost
But home he goþe he myȝt not soiourne
þe day was come þat homward most he tourne
And in his way it happed hym to ride
In al his care vndere a forest side
Where he segh in oon daunce goo 
Of ladis  and ȝit moo
  
Toward þe daunce he drowe hym ȝerne
In hope þat somme wisdom shuld he lerne
But certeynly er he cam fully þere
Vanysshed was þe daunce he nyst not where
No creature seye he þat bare lif  
Saue in þe grene he sey sitting a wif
A fouler wiȝt þer may no man deuise
Ageyn þe knyȝt þe old wif gan arise
And seide sir knyȝt here forþ ne lieþ no way
Telle me what þat ȝe seken be ȝoure fay
Perauenture it may þe better be
Thise olde folk konne moche þing quod she

Whatt þinge it is þat wommen most desire
Cowde ȝe me wisse I coude wel quyte ȝour hire
Plite me þi trouþe here in my hand quod she

Thow shalt it doo if it lye in þi myȝt
And I wille telle it ȝou er it be nyȝt
Haue here my trouþe quod þe knyȝt I graunte
Than quoþ she I may me wel auaunte

Vpon my lif þe quene wil say as I
Lat se which is þe proddest of hem alle
Þat wereth on a kerchif or a calle
Þat dar seie nay of þat I shal ȝou teche

Tho rowned she a pistel in his eere
And bad hym to be glad and han no fere
Whan þei be commen to þe courte þis knyȝt
Seide he had holde his day as he had hiȝt
And redy was his answere as he seide

And mony a widowe for þat þei be wise

Assembled ben þis answere forto here
And aftere þis knyȝt was bode apere
And þat þe knyȝt shuld telle in audience
To euery wiȝt commmaunded was silence
what þing þat worldly wommen louen mest  
This knyght ne stode not stille as doþ a beest
But to his question anon answerd
wiþ manly vois þat al þe courte it herde
My lege lady generally quod he

As wel ouer hir husbond and her loue
And forto be in maistrie hym aboue
This is ȝoure most desire þouȝe ȝe me kille
Doþ as ȝou list I am here at ȝoure wille
In al þe courte ne was þer wif ne mayde
Ne wydowe þat contraried what he saide
But seiden he was worþi han his lif
And wiþ þat word vp stert þat olde wif

Er þat ȝoure courte departe do me riȝt
I taught þis answere vnto þis knyȝt
ffor which he pliȝte me his troythe þere

He wold it doo ȝif it lay in his myȝt
Bifore þe court þan prey I þe sir knyȝt
Quod she þat þou me take vnto þi wiff
ffor wel þou woost þat I haue kepte þi liff
If I sey fals seye nay vpon þi faye

Take al my good and lat my body goo
Nay þan quod she I schrewe vs boþe twoo
ffor þouȝe þat I be foule and olde and poor

But ȝif þat I þi wif were and þi loue
My loue quod he nay my dampnacion
Allas þat eny of my nacion
Shuld euere so foule ydisparaged be  
But al for nouȝt þe ende is þis þat he
Constreyned was he nedes most her wedde
And takeþ þis olde wif and goþ to bedde
Nowe wolden somme men seyn perauenture
Þat for my necligence I do no cure
To telle ȝou þe Ioie and þe araye
þat at þe feest was þat ilk day
To which þinge shortly answere I shal
I seie þer nas no Ioye ne feest at all
þer nas but hevynesse and mochel sorowe
ffor priuely he wedded hure on a morowe
And alday aftere hid hym as an owle
So woo was him his wif loked so foule
Grete was þe sorowe þe knyȝt had in his þouȝt
Whan he was wiþ his wiff a bedde brouȝt
He waloweþ and turneþ to and froo
His olde wiff laye smyling euermoo
And seide o dere husbond o benedicite
fareþ euery knyȝt þus wiþ his wif as ȝe
Is þis þe lawe of king Arthures hous
Is euery knyȝt of his loue þus dangerous
I am ȝoure owne loue and eke ȝoure wiff
I am she which þat saued haþ ȝoure lif
And certes ȝit did I ȝou neuere vnriȝt
whi fare ȝe þus wiþ me þe firste nyȝt
Ȝe faren lich a man had lost his witte
ffy what is my gilt for goddes loue telle it
And it shal ben amended if I may
Amended quod þis knyȝt nay nay
That wil not bene amended neuere moo
Þou art so loþly and so old also
  
And þerto commen of so lowe a kinde

So wolde god my herte wolde bres
Is þis quod she þe cause of ȝoure vnrest
Ȝe certeinly quoþ he no wonder is  
Now sire quod she I couþe amende al þis
If þat me list er it were daies þre
So wel ȝe myȝt bere ȝou vnto me
 But for ȝe speken of such gentilesse
As is descended out of alle ricchesse

Such errogannce nys not worþ an hen
Loke who so is moost vertuous alway
Privey and aperte and best endeþ ay
To do þe beste dedis þat he can
And take him for þ grettest gentile man
Of criste cleyme we our gentylesse
Not of oure elders for our old ricchesse
ffor þouȝe þei ȝeue vs al our heritage
ffor which we cleyme to be of hie parage
Ȝit may þei not byqueeþ for no þing
To noon of vs her vertuous lyuynge

And bad vs folowen in such degre

Lo in such manere Ryme is dantes tale
fful seelde vpriseþ by his braunches smale
Prowesse of man for god of his prouesse

ffor of oure elders may we no þing clayme
But temporel þing þat man may hirt and mayme
Eke euery wiȝt wote þis as wel as I

Vnto a certeyn lynage doun þe lyne

To don of gentelesse þe fair office

Take fire and bere it in þe derkest hous
Bytwix þis and the mount of Caucasous
And lat men shette þe doores and go þenne  
Ȝit wol þe fire as faire lye and brenne
A thowsand men myȝt it biholde
His office naturel ay wil it holde
Vp perile of liff til þat it die
Here may ȝe se wel how þat gentrie
Is nat annexed to possession
Siþ folk do not her operacion
Al waie as doþ þe fire lo in his kinde
ffor god it wote men may ful often fynde
A lordes sone doo shame and vilenye
And he þat wil haue price of his gentrie
ffor he was born of a gentile hous
And had his elders noble and vertuous
And nyl himseluen do no gentile dedys
Ne folow his gentile Auncestre þat dede is
He nys nat gentile be he duke or erle
ffor vileyns sinful dedes make a cheerle
ffor gentilnesse nys but reuent renome
Of þine ancestres for hir bewte bounte
Whiche is a strong þing for þi persone
The gentilesse commeþ from god alone
Than commeth our verrey gentilesse of grace
It was no þing byqueþe vs with our place
Thenkeþ howe noble as seiþ valerius
Was þilk Tullius Hostilius
þat out of pouerte roos to hie noblesse
Redeþ Senek and redeþ eke Boesse
þer shul ȝe sene expresse þat it no drede is
þat he is gentile þat doþ gentile dedys
And þerfore dere husbonde I þus conclude
Al were it þat myn ancestres were rude
  
Ȝit may þat hie god an so hope I
Graunt me grace to lyue vertuously
Than am I gentile whan þat I bygynne
To lyuen vertuously and leuen synne
And þer as ȝe of pouert me repreue  
The hie god on whom þat we byleue
In wilful pouerte chas to lede his lif
And certes euery man boþ maide and wiff
May vnderstonde Ihesu heuen kinge
Ne wold not chese a vicious lyuynge
Glad pouerte is an honest þing certayn
This wil senek and oþere clerkes seyn
Who þat holte him paide of his pouerte
I holde him riche al had he nouȝt serte
He þat coueiteþ is a poor wiȝt
ffor he wold han þat is not in his myȝt
But he þat nouȝt haþ ne keueiteþ to haue
Is riche al þough men hold him but a knaue
Verrey pouerte is signe proprely
Iuuenal  of pouert merily
The poor man whan he goþ by þe way
Biforn þe þeues he may singe and play
Pouerte is hatel good and as y gesse
A ful grete bringer out of bysynesse
A grete amender eke of sapience
To him þat lackeþ it in pacience
Pouerte is þis al þough it seme alenge
Possession þat no wiȝt wil chalenge
Pouerte ful often whan a man is lowe
Makeþ his god and eke him self to knowe
Pouerte in spectacle is as þenkeþ me
þorowe which he may his verrey frendes see
And þerfor siþ þat I ȝou not greue
Of my pouerte no more me repreue
Now sire of elde ȝe repreue me
And certes sire þorowe non auctorite
  
Where in no boke ȝe gentile in honour
Seyn þat mon shuld an olde wif do fauour
And clepe hur modere for ȝoure gentilnesse
And auctours shal I fynde as I gesse
Now þere ȝe seyn þat I am foule and olde  
Than drede ȝou not to bene a kokewold
ffor filþe and helde also mote I thee
Bene grete wardeyns vpon chastite
But naþeles siþ I knowe ȝoure delite
I shal fulfille ȝoure worldly appetite
Chese nowe quod she oon of þise þingges twey
To han me foule and olde til þat I dye
And be to ȝou a trewe humble wiff
And neuere ȝou displese in al my lif
Or ellis ȝe wil haue me ȝonge and faire
And take ȝoure auenture of þe repaire
That shal come to ȝoure hous bycause of me
Or in some oþere place wel may be
Nowe chese ȝoure seluen wheþer ȝou likeþ
This knyght avised him and sor sikeþ
But at þe last he seide in þis manere
My lady and my loue  and wif so dere
I putte me in ȝoure wise gouernaunce
Geueþ ȝoure self which may be most plesaunce
And most honour to ȝou and me also
I do no force þe wheþere of þe two
ffor as ȝou likeþ it suffiseþ me
Than haue I gote of ȝou þe maistrie quod she
Siþ I may chese and gouern as me list
ȝe certes wif quod he I holde it for þe best
Kisse me quod she we be no lenger wroþe
ffor by my trouþe I wil be to ȝou boþe
þis is to seine boþ faire and goode
I prei to god þat I mot steruen woode
But I to ȝou be as sadde and trewe
As euere was wiff syþ þat þe world was newe
  
And but I be to morow as fair to sene
As eny lady Emperesse or quene
Þat is bytwene þe Est and eke þe west
doþ wiþ my liff and deþe riȝt as ȝou lest
Cast vp þe Curtyne loke how it is  
And whan þe knyȝt sawe al þis
Þat she so faire was and so yonge þerto
ffor ioie he hent her in his armes twoo
His herte bathed in a bath of blisse
A  tyme a rowe hire gan he kisse
And she obeied him in euery þinge
That myght done hym plesaunce or likinge
And þus þei lyued vnto her lyues ende
In parfitt Ioye and Ihesus crist vs sende
Husbonde  yonge  meke and fresssh abedde
And grace to ouerlede hem þat we wedde
And eke I prei to Ihesu short her lyues
That wil not be gouerned by her wyues
And olde and angry nygard and dispence
God sende hem sone a verrey pestilence
This worþi lymitour þis noble ffrere
He made alway louring chere
Vpon þe somnour  but for honeste
No vyleyns word as ȝit speke he
But at þe last he seide vnto þe wif
Dame good god ȝeue ȝou riȝt good lyf
Ȝe han touched here also mote I the
In scole matere grete difficulte
Ȝe han seide mochel þing riȝt wel I seie
But dame here as we riden by þe weie
Vs nedeþ not to speken but of game
And late auctoritees a goddes name
To prechen and to scole eke of clergie
But ȝif it like vnto þis companye
I wil ȝou of a somnour telle a game
Parde I may wel knowe by þi name
That of no somnour may no good be seid
I prey þat noon of ȝou be euel apeid
A somnour is a romere vp and doun  
Wiþ a mendement of fornicacioun
And is ibete at euery townes ende
Our hoost þoo spak a  sire ȝe shuld ben hende
And Curteis as man of ȝour astat
In company we wil no debate
Telleþ ȝoure tale and lat þe somnour be
Nay quod þe somnour lat him say to me
What so him lest  whan it commeþ to my lott
Be god I· shal hym quyte euery grott
I shal him telle swich a grete honour
It is to be a flateryng lymytour
And eke of ful mony an oþer crime
Which nedeþ not rehersen at þis tyme
And his office I shal hym telle ywis
Our hooste answerd pees no more of þis
And afterward he seide vnto þe frere
Telle forþ ȝoure tale my owen maister dere
Whilom þer was dwelling in my contre
An Archedeken a man of hie degre
That boldely did execusion
In punysshing of fornicacion
Of which craft and eke of baudry
Of diffamacion and avoutrye
Of chirche reues and of testamentes
Of contractes and of lak of sacramentes
Of vsure and symonye also
But certes lecchours did he grettest woo
Þei shulden syngen if þei were hent
And Smale Tythers weren foule shent
If eny person wold vpon hem pleyne
Þer myȝt astert him no pecunyal peyne
ffor smale tyþes and eke smale offringe
He made þe puple spitously to singe
ffor er the bisshope kauȝt hem wiþ his hoke  
Þei weren in þe Archedekens boke
And þan had he þorowe his Iurisdiction
Pouer to don on hem correccion
he had a somnour redy to his hand
A sclyer boye was non in engelond
ffor sotilly he had his especiale
That tauȝt hym where þat hym myȝt availe
He coude spare of lecchours on or twoo
To techen hym to  moo
ffor þouȝe this somnour wode were as an hare
To telle his harlotry I wil not spare
  
ffor we bene out of her correcciōn
Þei han of vs non Iurisdiction
Ne neuere shullen teerme of al her lyues
Peter so bene þe wommen of þe stewes
Quod this somnour yput out of our cure
Pees wiþ meschaunce and wiþ misauenture
Thus seide our hoost and lat hym telle his tale
Now telleþ forþ and lat þe somnour gale
Ne spareth nouȝt myn owne Maister dere
This fals þeef þis somnour quod þe frere
Had alway baudes redy to his honde
As eny hauke to lure in Engelonde
That telle him al þe secre þat thei knewe
ffor hure aqueyntance was nat come of newe
þei weren his aprouers prively
He toke hym silf a grete prophete þerby
His maistere knewe not al way what he wan
wiþouten maundement of a lewde man
He coude sommon vpeyn of cristes curs
And þei were inly glad to fille his purs
And made hym grete festes atte nale
And riȝt as Iudas had purses smale
And was a þeef riȝt such a þeef was he
His maister had but half his dwete
He was ȝif I shal ȝeuene hym his laude  
A theef and eke a somnour and a bawde
He had eke wenches of his retenue
That whedere þat sir Roberde or sir hwe
Or Iohn or rauf or who þat it were
þat lay by hem þei tolde it in his eere
Thus was þe wenche and he of on assent
And he wolde focche a feyned maundement
And somne hem to þe chapitere boþ twoo
And pille þe man and lat þe wenche goo
Than wold he sei frend I shal for þi sake
To strike þe out of oure letters blake
  
Þe ther no more as in þis caas travaile
I am þi frende þer I þe may availe
Certeyn he knewe of bribers moo
þan possible is to telle ȝou vnto to
ffor in þis world is no dogge for no bowe
þat knoweþ and hert deer from an olde bete kowe
þan þat þis somnour knewe a sly lecchour
Or auouter or ellis a paramour
And for þat was þe fruyte of al þe rent
Therfore on hit he sette al his entent
And so byfelle þat ones on a day
This somnour euer wayting on his pray
Rode forto somne an old wif a ribibe
ffeynyng a cause for he wold haue a bribe
And happed þat he sawe tofore hym ride
A gey ȝeman vnder a forest side
A bowe he bare and Arowes briȝt and kene
He had vpon a courtepie of grene
An hatte vpon his hede wiþ stringges blake
Sire quod þis somnour haile and wel ytake
welcome quod he and euery good felawe
whider ridest þowe vnder þis grene wood shawe
Seide þis ȝeman wilt thou fer today
This somnour hym answerd and seide nay
Here fast by quod he is myne entent  
To riden for to reisen vp a rent
It longeþ to my lordes dewte
Art þou þan a bailyf ȝe quod he
He durste not for verrey filþe and shame
Say þat he was a somnour for þe name
Depardieux quod þis ȝeman dere broþer
þou art a baillif and I am anoþer
I am vnknowen as in þis contre
Of þine aqueyntance I wil prey þe
And eke of breþerhede if þat þou lest
I haue gold and siluer in my chest
  
ȝif þat þe happed come into our shire
Al shal be þine riȝt as þou wold desire
Graunte mercy quod þis somnour by my feiþe
Euerech in oþeres honde his trouþe leiþe
ffor to be swore breþeren to þei dye
And wiþ þat word þei ride forþ her wey
This somnour wiþ þat was as ful of Iangles
As ful of venyme ben þise waryangles
And euer enquiring vpon euery þinge
Broþer quod he wher is ȝour dwellinge
Anoþer day if I shuld ȝou seche

Broþer quod he ferre in þe north contre
Wher as I hope somtyme I shal þe See
Or we departe I shal þe so wel wisse

Now broþere quod þis somnour I ȝou pray
Teche me while we riden by þe waye
Siþ þat ȝe bene a balif as am I
Somme subtilite telle me feiþfully
In myn office howe þat I may most wynne
And spareþ not for conscience ne synne
But as my broþere telle me howe doo ȝe
Nowe by my treuþe broþere dere seide he
As I shal tellen þe a feiþful tale  
My wages be ful streit and smale
My lorde is hard to me and daungerous
And myn office ful laborous
And þerfore by extorcions y lyue
ffor soþ I  al þat men wil me ȝeue
Algate by scleyght or violence
ffrom ȝeer to ȝeer I wynne al my dispence
I can no better tellen feiþfully
Now certes quod þis somnour so fare I
I spare not to take god it wote
But ȝif it be to hevy or to hote
  
What I may gete in counseile priveily
No maner conscience of þat haue I
Ner myn extorcion I myȝt not lyuen
Of suche Iapes nyl I not be shryuen
Stomake  ne for conscience ne knowe I non
I schrewe þise shrift faders euerechon
Wel ben we mette by god and by seint Iame
But leue broþer telle me þan þi name
Quoþ þis somnour in þis mene while
Þis ȝeman gan a litel forto smyle
Broþer quod he wiltow þat I þe telle
I am a feende my dwellyng is in helle
And here I ride aboute my purchasing
To wete where men wollen ȝeue me eny þing
My purchace is to fette of all my rent
Loke how þou ridest for þe same entent
To wynne good þou recchest not howe
Riȝt so fare I for ride wold I nowe
Vnto þe worldes eende for a preye
A quod þis somnour benedicite what ȝe seie

Ȝe han a mannes shappe as wel as I
Han ȝe a figure þan determynate
In helle þer ȝe bene in ȝour estate
Nay certeynly quoþ he þere haue we noon  
But whan vs likeþ we can take vs oon
Or ellis make ȝou seme we bene shape
Somtyme a man or like an ape
Or like an aungel can I ride or goo
It is no wonder þing þouȝe it be so
A lousy Iogelour can desceyue þe
And parde ȝit can I more craft þan he
Why quoþ þis somnour ride ȝe þan or gon
In sondry shappe and not alway in oon
ffor we quod he wil vs in such forme make
As most able is our praies forto take
  
What makeþ ȝou to han al þis labour
fful mony a cause leeue sir somnour
Seide þis feende but al þing haþ tyme
The day is short and it is passed prime
And ȝit ne wanne I no þinge in þis day

And nat entende our wittes to declare
ffor broþer myne þi witte is alto bare
To vnderstonde þouȝe I tolde hem þe
But for þowe askest whi labouren we
ffor somtyme be we goddes instrumentes
And menes to do his comaundementes
Whan þat him list vpon his creatures
In dyuers actes and in dyuers figures
Withouten hym we han no myȝt certeyn
Ȝif þat him list to stonden þer aȝein
And some tyme at our pray han we leue
Only þe body and nat þe soule greue
Witnesse on Iob whom þat we diden woo
And somtyme han we myȝt of boþ two

And somtyme we bene suffered forto seke
Vpon a man and do his soule vnrest
And nat his body and al is for þe best
Whan he withstondeþ our temptacion  
It is a cause of  saluacion
Al be it þat it was not our entent
He shulde be sauf but þat we wold hym hent
And somtyme be we seruauntes vnto man
As þe erchbisshope seint dunstan
And to þe appostels seruaunte was I
Ȝit telleþ me quod þe somnour feiþfully
Make ȝe ȝou newe bodies þus alway
Of elementz þe feende answerd nay
Somme tyme we feyne and somtyme we arise

And speke as resonably and faire well

And ȝit wil somme men say it was not he

But oon þing warne I þe I wil not Iape
Thow wilt algates witte howe we be shape
Þou shalt here afterward my broþer dere

Lat him be trewe and part it with his broþer

And wiþ þat word þei ryden forth her way
And riȝt at þe enteringe of þe townes ende

And þei bygonne to drowe and to stoupe

And god þat made after his ymage

And lene þis somnour good man to bycome

And preieþ þat þis somnour hym repent
Of his mysdede er þat þe fende hym hent

Siþens ȝe han herde this fals frere lye

And god woote it is litel wondere
ffreres and feendes bene but lite asonre
ffor parde ȝe han oft tyme herd telle  
How þat a frere rauysshed was in helle
In spirit ones by A visioun
And as an aungel lad him vp and doun
To shewen him the peynes þat þer were
In all þe place segh he not a frere
Of oþer folk he segh ynow in woo
Vnto þis aungel speke þe frere þoo
Nowe sire quod he han freres suche grace

Ȝis quoþ þis aungel mony a mylioun
And vnto Sathanas he lad hym doun
And now haþ sathanas seiþ he a tale
Bradder þan of þe Carike is a saile

Showe forþ þine ers and lat þe frere see
Wher is þe nest of freres in þis place
And er þan half a forlonge wey of space
  
Ryȝt as been swermen out of an hyve
Out of þe deuels ers þei gon drive
xxti thousand freres on a route
And þought helle swarme al aboute
And commen aȝein as fast as þei mowe gon
And in his ers þei crepten euerechon
He clapte his taile aȝein and lay stille
This frere whan he loked had his fille
Vpon þise turmentz of þis sory place
His spiret god restored of his grace
Vnto his body aȝein and he awoke
But naþelees for fere ȝit he quoke
So was þe deueles ers ay in his mynde
which is his heritage of verrey kinde
God saue you alle saue þis cursed frere
My prologe wil I ende in þis manere
LOrdyngges þer is in yorkshire as I gesse  
A mershy contray called holdernesse
In which þere went a lymitour aboute
To preche and eke to begge it is no doute
And so byfelle þat on a day þis frere
Had preched atte chirch in þis manere
And specialy abouen euery þinge
Excited he þe puple in his prechinge
To trentales and  for goddis sake
Therwiþ men myȝte holy howses make
Ther as dyuyne seruyse is honoured
Nouȝt þere as it is waasted and deuoured
Ne þere it nedeþ not forto be ȝeue
As to possessoures þat may ellis lyue
Thonked be god in wele and habundaunce
Trentales seide he delyuereþ fro penaunce
Her frendes soules as wel olde as yonge
Ȝif þat þei bene hastely ysonge
Nouȝt forto holde a preest Ioly and gay
He syngeþ not but oon masse on a day
Delyuereþ out quod he anon þe soules
fful hard it is wiþ flesshhoke eiþer with oulys
Nul spede ȝou hastely for cristes sake
To kepe ȝou from peynes of fendes blake
And whan þe frere had seide al his entente
With qui cum patre forþ he wente
Whan folk in chirche had ȝeue hym what hem lest
He went his way no lenger wold he rest
  
Wiþ scrippe and tipped staf tukked ful hie
In euery hous he gan to pore and prie
And beggeþ mele or chese or ellis corn
His felawe had a staf tipped wiþ horn
A paire of tables of yuorie
And a poyntel polsshed fetisly
And wote alway þe names þer he stode
And alle folk þat ȝaue hym eny goode

Or ȝeue vs of ȝoure  ȝif ye haue enye
A dagon of ȝour blanket leue dame
Our suster deer loo here I write ȝour name

A sturdy harlot went alway behinde

And what men ȝaue hym leide it on his bak
And whan he was out of þe door anon
He pleyned away  names euerechon

He serued  wiþ nyfels and wiþ fables
Nay þerIn þu lixt somnour quod þe frere

Telle forþ þi tale and spare it not at all
ffor hym ne for noon oþere what so fall
So longe he went hous by hous til he

Refresshed more þan in an C places
Seke lay þe good man þat of the place es 
Bedred vpon a couche lowe he lay
Deus hic quod he o thomas frende good day
Seide þis frere curtesly and soft
Thomas god ȝeeld ȝou wel oft
  
Haue I vpon þis benche faren ful wele
Here haue I eten mony a mery mele
And from þe benche he droof away þe catt
And leide a doune his potent and his hatt
And eke his scripte and sette hym soft adoun
His felawe was go walked in to þe toun

Where as he shope hym þilke nyȝt to lye
O dere Maister quod þis sike man  
How haue ȝe farn siþ þat march bygan

And seide a sermon after my symple witte

Thonked be god þat ȝou ȝaf soule and liff

Thise Curatours bene ful necligent and sclowe
To grope tenderly a conscience  
In shrift in preching is my diligence
And stody in peter wordes and poules

To ȝeelde Ihesu his propre rent
To speke his wordes is al myn entent
Nowe by ȝoure feiþ dere maister quod she

To wake þat my stomak is destroied

Sone after þat ȝe wenten out of þis toun  
His deþ I segh by reuelacioun

Aftere his deþ I segh hym born to blisse
In myn avision god me so wis
So dyd our Sexten and our fermerere

Maken hir Iuble and walken alone
And vp I aroos and all our couent eke

Þan borel folk or þouȝe þei were kingges
We lyue in pouerte and in abstinence
And burel folk in ricchesse and in dispence
In mete and drink and her foule delite
We han þis worldly lust al in dispite
 Lazarus and Diues liveden dyuersly
And dyuers guardon had þei þerby
Who so wil prey most fast and be clene
And fat his soule and make his body lene
  
We faren as seiþ þe apostel cloþe and fode
Suffiseþ vs þouȝe þei be not ful goode
The clannes and þe fasting of vs freres
Makeþ þat criste accepteþ our preieres
Loo Moyses fourty daies and fourty nyȝt

Wiþ empty woombe of fasting mony a day
Resceyued he þe law þat was writen   
wiþ goddys fyngere and hely wil ȝe witen
In mount Oreb er he had eny speche
Wiþ hie god þat is our saules leche

Aaron þat had þe temple in gouernaunce
And eke þe oþer preestes euerechon
Into þe temple whan þei shuld gon
To prey for þe puple and to do seruise
þei nold drinke in no manere wise
No drink which þat hem dronke myȝt make
But þer in abstinence prey and wake
lest þat þei diden take hede what I saye
But þei be sobre þat for þe puple praye

Our lorde Ihesu as holy writte deuyseþ
Ȝaf vs ensample of fastinge and preiers
Therfore we mendenauntz we sely freres
Be wedde to pouerte and contynence
To charite humblenesse and abstinence
To persecucyon for riȝtwisnesse
To wepinge misericord and clennesse
And þerfore may ȝe see þat our preiers
I speke of vs we mendenauntz we freres
Bene to þe hie god more acceptable
þan ȝoures with þe fest at þe table
ffor paradis first if I shal not lye

And chaast man was in paradis certeyn
But harken nowe Thomas wha I wil seyn
I haue no tixte þerof as I suppose
But I shal fynde it in a manere glose
That specialy our lorde swete Ihesus
Spake by freres whan he seide þus
Blessed be þei þat poor in spirite be
And so forþ al þe gospel may ȝe se
Wher it be like our profession  
Or her þat swymmen in possession
ffye on her pompe and on her glotenye
And on her lewdenesse I ham defie
Me þenkeþ þei ben like Iouynyan

Al vinolent as þe betel in þe spence
Her preier is of ful grete reuerence
Whan þei for soules seyn þe Psalme of davyd

Who foloweþ cristes gospel and his lore
But we þat humyle ben and chast and pore
Worchers of goddis word  auditours

Vp springeþ into þe eire so preiers
And charitable chastite of bysy freres
Making her soures to goddes eren too
Thomas riȝt so as mote I ride or goo
And by þat lord þat cleped was seynt yve
Ner þowe our broþer þou shuldest not thryve
In oure Chapitle prey we day and nyȝt
To crist þat he þe sende hele and myȝt
Thi body forto welden hastely
God wote quoþ he no þing þerof fele I
As helpe crist as I haue in fewe ȝeres
Spended vpon mony dyuers freres
Wel mony a pounde ȝit fare I ne þe bette
Certeyn my good is almost besette
  
ffare wele my good for it is almost agoo
þe frere answerd o Thomas dost þou so
What nedeþ ȝou diuers freres seche
What nedeþ hym þat haþ a perfit leche
To sechen oþer leches in þe toun
Ȝour inconstance is ȝour confusion
Holde ȝe me þan or ellis our couent
To prey for ȝou ben insufficient
Thomas þat Iape is not worþ a myte  
Ȝoure Maladie is for we haue to lite
A ȝeue þat Couent half a quarter otys
A ȝeue þat Couent  grotys
A ȝeue þat frere a peny and lat hym goo
Nay nay thomas it may no þing be so
What is a ferþing parted in twelve
Lo eche þing is counted in hym selue
Is more stronge whan it is so sclatered
Thomas of me þou shalt not be flatered 
þou woldest haue our labour al for nouȝt
þe hie god þat al þis world haþ wrouȝt
Seiþ þat þe werkman is worþi his hire
Thomas nouȝt for ȝoure tresour I desire
As for my silf but þat al our Couent
To prey for ȝou is al our diligent
And forto beelden cristes owne chirche
Thomas if ȝe wil lerne forto wirche
Of beeldinge vp of churches may ȝe finde
If it be good in Thomas lif of ynde
Ȝe ligge here ful of anger and of yre
wiþ which þe deuel sette ȝour hert on fire
And chiden here þis holy Innocent
Ȝour wif þat is so meke and pacient
And þerfore trow me ȝif ȝou list
Ne strive not wiþ þi wif as for þe best
And bere þis word away now by þi feiþ
Touchinge such þing lo what þe wise man seiþ
  
WiþInne þi hous ne be þou no lyon
To þi sogettes do þou noon opression
Ne make þou nat þine aqueyntaunce forto fle
And ȝit Thomas eftsones charge I þe
Be ware of yre þat in þi bosom slepeþ
ware þe for the serpent þat so sclily crepeþ
vnder þe gras and styngeþ sotilly
Be war my sone and harken paciently
That xxti þousand men han lost her lyues  
ffor stryuyng with her lemmanes and her wyues
Now siþ ȝe han so holy meke a wif
What nedeþ ȝou thomas to make strif
Ther nys iwis no serpent so cruel
Whan men treden on his tale ne half so fell
As a womman is whan she haþ kauȝt an Ire
Vengeaunce is þan al þat þei desire
Ire is an synne oon þe grete of seuene
Abhominable vnto god in heuene
And to hym self it is distruccion
Thus euery lewde vicar or parson
Can seie how Ire engendres homice
Ire is in soþ executour of pride
I coude of Ire seie so mochel sorowe
My tale shuld last vnto tomorowe
And þerfore I prei god boþ day and nyȝt
An yrous man god sent hym litel myȝt
It is grete harme and eke gret pite
To sette an yrous man in hie degre
 Whilom þer was an yrous potestate
As seiþ senek þat during his estate
Vpon a day oute riden knyȝtes twoo
And as fortune wolde it shuld be so
þat oon of hem come home þat oþere nouȝt
Anon þe knyȝt byfore þe Iuge was brouȝt
þat saide þus þou hast þi felawe sclayn
ffor which I deme þe to deþ certeyn
  
And to an oþer knyȝt commanded he
Go lede him to deþe I charge þe
And happed as þei went by þe way
Toward þe place þer he shuld day
þe knyȝt come which men wende had ben dede
þan þouȝt þei it was þe best rede
To lede hem boþ to þe Iuge agayn
þei seiden lord þe knyȝt nys not slayn
His felawe here he stant hool a lyue  
He shal be dede quod he so mot I thryue
þat is to seyn boþ on two and þre
And þoo to þe first knyȝt riȝt þus spoke he
I dampne þe þe most algate be dede
And þou also most nedes lese þine hede
ffor þou art cause of þi felawes deþe
And to þe  knyȝte þus he seiþe
Thou hast not done þat I commaunded þe
And þus he did hem sleen al þre
 Irous Cambises was eke dronkenlewe
And ay delited him to bene a shrewe
And so byfelle a lorde and his mayne
That loued vertuous moralite
Seide vpon a day bitwix hem two riȝt þus
A lorde is lost if he be vicius
And dronkenesse eke is a foule record
Of eny man and namely in a lord
þer is wel mony an yre and mony an ere
In waytinge and he note where
ffor goddes  drynkeþ more attemperaly
Wyne makeþ a man to lesen wrecchedly
his mynde and his lymes euerechon
þe reuerce shalt þou see quod he anon
And preue it by þine  experience
That wyne ne doþ to folk non such offence
þer nys no wyne byreueþ me my myȝt
of honde ne of foote ne of myn eye sight
  
And for despite he dronke mochel more
An C part þan he had don byfore
And riȝt anon þis yrous cursed wreche
lete þise knyȝtes sones tofore hym fecche
Comaundyng hem þei shuld tofore hym stonde
And sodeynly he toke his bowe on honde
And vp the strenge he pulled to his ere
And wiþ an arowe he sclowe þe childe riȝt þere
Nowe wheþer haue I a siker hond or non  
Quod he is al my myȝt and mynde agon
Haþ wyne byreued me myn eye siȝt
What shuld I telle answere of þe knyȝt
His sone was sclayn þer nys no more to say
Be ware þerfor wiþ lordes howe ȝe play
Syng Placebo and I shal ȝif I can
But if it be to a poor man
To poor man shuld he his vices telle
But not to a lord þough he shuld goo to helle
Lo Irous Arus þilk Percian
how he distroied þe Ryuer of gysan
ffor þat an hors of his was dreynt þer Inne
Whan he went babilonye to wynne
He made þat þe Ryuer was so smal
þat as men myȝt passed ouer al
lo þat he so wel teche can
Ne be ȝe no felawe to non yrous man
Ne wiþ no woode man þat walkeþ by þe way
lasse þe repent I wil no ferþere say
Now Thomas leue broþer leue þine Ire
þou shalt me fynde as Iuste as is a squyere
Hold not þe deuels knyf ay in þine herte
Thyne anger doþ þe al to sore smerte
But shewe it me al þi confession
Nay quod þe sik man by seint Symeon
I haue be shrive þis day at my curate
I haue tolde hym alholy myne astate
  
It nedeþ no more to speke of it seid he
But if me list of myne humilite
Ȝeue me þan of ȝoure gold to make our cloister
Quod he for mony a muscle and mony an oyster
Whan oþer men han bene ful wel at ese
Haþ bene our fode our cloister forto rese
And god wote vnneþ þe foundement
Perfourmed is and of our payvement
Is nouȝt a tyle wiþInne our wonys  
By god we owen xl pounde for stonys
Now helpe Thomas for hym þat harowed helle
ffor ellis mote we our bokes selle
And ȝif ȝou lakke our predicacion
Than goþ þis world al to distruccion
ffor who so wold from þis world vs byreue
So god me saue thomas by ȝoure leue
He wolde byreue out of þe world þe sonne
ffor who can techen and worchen as we konne
And þat is nouȝt of litel tyme quod he
But siþ Elie was or Elise
Han freres be þat fynde I of record
In charite þonkidde be our lord
Now thomas  for seint charite
Haue done anon he sette hym on his kne
This sik man wex nye woode for Ire
He wolde þat þe frere had be a fire
Wiþ his fals dissimulacion
Such þing as is in my possession
Quoþ he þat may I ȝeue and non oþere
ȝe sein me thus hou þat I am ȝour broþere
ȝe certes quoþ þis frere trusteþ wel
I toke our dame þe letter of our seel
Nowe quoþ he wel and somwhat shal I ȝeue
Vnto ȝoure holy Couent while I lyve
And in þine honde þou shalt it haue anōn
Vp þis condicion and oþer non
  
That þou departe it so my dere broþer
Þat euery frere haue as moch as oþer
This shalt þou swere on þi profession
Wiþouten fraude or cauellacion
I swere it quod þe frere by my faiþ
And þerwiþal his honde in his he laiþ
lo here my feiþ in me shal be no lak
Now þan put þine honde doun by my bak
Seide þis man and grope wel behinde  
Byneþ my buttok þer þou shalt fynde
A þinge þat I haue hidde in priuete
A þouȝt þe frere þat shal go wiþ me
Adoune his honde he launseþ to þe clift
I hope for to fynde þer a ȝift
And whan þis sik man felt þis frere
About his trwel grope her and þere
A myddes his honde he lete þe frere a fart
þer nys no capel drawing in a cart
þat myȝt han lete a fart of such a soun
þe frere vp stert as doþ a  lyoun
A fals cherle quod þe frere for goddis bonys
This despite þou hast done for þe nonys
þowe shal aby þis fart if I may
His mayne þat harde þis affray
Come lepinge Inne and chased out þe frere
And forþe he goþ with a ful angry chere

He ne had nat ellis for his sermon
To parten amonge his breþeren whan he come home
And þus is þis tale ydon
ffor we were almost at þe ton
Sir Clerk of Oxenford our oost saide
Ȝe ride as stille as Coy as doþ a maide
Were newe spoused sitting at þe borde
This day ne herd I of ȝoure mouþ a word
I trowe þat ȝe stodye about som sophyme
But Salomon seiþ al þinge haþ tyme
ffor goddes sake beþ of better chere
It is no tyme nowe to stody here
Telle vs some mery tale by ȝour fay
ffor what man is entred into a play
he nedes mote into þat play assent
But prcheþ not as freres don in lent
To make vs for our olde synnes to wepe  
Ne þat þi tale ne make vs not to sclepe
Telle vs somme mery þing of auentures
Ȝoure termes ȝoure colours and figures
kepe hem in store til ȝe hem endite
hiȝe stele as whan men to kyngges write
Spekeþ so pleyn at þis tyme I ȝou prey
That we may vnderstonde what ȝe sey
This worþi clerk benygnely answered
Hoost quod he I am vndere ȝour ȝeerde
ȝe han as nowe of vs þe gouernaunce
And þerfor wil I do ȝou obeysaunce
  
As fer as reson askeþ hardely
I wil ȝou tel a tale which þat I
lerned at Padowe of a worþi clerke
As preued by his wordys and his werk
He is nowe dede and nailed in his chest
I prei to god so send his soule good rest
ffraunceys Petrak þe laureol poete
Hight þis clerke whoos retorike swete
Enlumyneþ al Itaile þorgh poetrie
As lynyan did of Philosophye
Or lawe or oþer art particulere
But deþe þat nyl suffre no þing here
But as it were a twynkelinge of an ye
Boþ haþ he slayn and al shal we dye
But forto tellen of þis worþi man
Þat tauȝt me þis tale as I first bygan
I sey þat he first wiþ hygh steel enditeþ
Or he þe body of his tale writeþ
A procheyn in þe which disseuereþ he
þe Mounde and of Saluse þe contree
And spekeþ of Appenyn þe hilles hye
þat ben þe bondes of west lumbardye
And of Mount Resulus in special
Wher as þe Poo out of a welle smal
Takeþ his furst spryngginge and his sours  
Wher as he holt euen streiȝt way his cours
To Emel ward to ferrare and to venyse
The which a longe þinge were to devise
And trewely as to my Iugement
Mee thenkeþ it a þing inpertinent
Saue he wil conuey his matere
But þis is þe tale which þat ȝe shal here
Ther is at þe west side of ytayle
Doune at þe rote of vesulus þe cold
A lusty pleyn abundant of vitaile
wher mony a toune and tour þou maist bihold
þat founded were in tyme of elders olde
And mony anoþer delectable siȝt
And saluce þis noble cuntre hiȝt
A Marquis whilom  was in þat lond
As were his worþi elders hym bifore
And Obeisaunt and redy to his hond
Were alle his leeges boþ lasse and more
Þus in delite he lyued and haþ do ȝore
Beloued and drad þourgh fauour of fortune
Boþ of his lordys and of his comune
Therwiþ he was to speke of lynage
The gentelest yborn of al lumbardy
A faire persone  stronge and ȝenge of age
And ful of honure and curteisie
Discrete ynouȝe his cuntrey forto gye
Saue in some þingges he was to blame
And Water was þis yonge lordes name
I blame him þus þat he considered nouȝt
In tyme commynge what myȝt betide
But on his lust present was al his þouȝt  
And forto hauke and hunte on euery side
Wel nye al oþer cures lete he slide
And eke he ne wold þat was worst of all
Wedde no wif for ouȝt myȝt byfall
  
Only þat pointe his puple bere so sore
þat flokmele on a day þei  went
And oon of hem þat wisest was of lore
Or ellis þat þe lorde wold best assent
þat he shulde telle hym what his puple ment
Or ellis coude he wel shewe such matere
He to þe Marquis seide as ȝe mowe here
O Noble Marquis ȝoure humanitee
Assureþ vs and ȝeueth vs hardynesse
As ofte tyme as it is necessite
That we ȝou mow telle our heuynesse
Accepteþ lord of ȝour gentilnesse

And lat ȝoure eeres not my vois disdeyne
Al haue I nouȝt to done in þis matere
More þan anoþer haþ in þis place

Haue alway shewed  fauour and grace
I dare þe better aske of ȝou a space
Of audience to shewen our request
And ȝe my lord to done riȝt as ȝou lest
For certes lord so wel vs likeþ ȝou
And alle ȝoure werkes and euer han do þat we
Ne cowde nat our owne silf devisen howe
We myȝt more lyve in felicite
Saue oo þinge lord if it ȝour wille be
That to be a wedded man if ȝou list
Than were our puple in souereyn hertes rest  
Boweþ ȝoure nek vndere þat blisful ȝok
Of souereynte nouȝt of seruise
Which men clepe spousale or wedlok
And þenkeþ lord among ȝoure þouȝtes wise
  
That of wedloke commeþ grete emprise
ffor þouȝe we slepe or wake ronne or ride
Ay fleeþ þe tyme it wil no man abide
And þouȝe ȝour grene ȝouþe growe as ȝit
In crepeþ age alway as stille as stone
And deþe manaseþ euery age and smyt
In eche astate for þer ascapeþ noon
And also certeyn as we knowe euerichon
Þat we shul dye as vncerteyn we all
Ben of þat day þat deþ shal on vs falle
Accepteth þan of vs þe trewe entent
That neuere ȝit refused your heest
And we wil al lord ȝif ȝe wil assent
Chese ȝou a wif in short tyme at the lest
Born of þe gentelest and of þe mest
Of al þis londe so þat it out seme
Honure to god and ȝou so as we con deme
Delyuere vs of al þis bysy drede
And take a wif for hiȝe goddis sake
ffor ȝif it byfelle so as god forbede
þat þourgh deþ ȝour lynage shuld sclake
And a straunge lynage shuld take
Ȝour heritage oo woo were vs alyue
Wherfore we prey ȝou hastely to wif
Her meke preier and her pitous chere
Made þe Marquis haue such pite
Wil ȝe quod he myne owne puple dere  
To þat I neuer erst þouȝt constreyne me
I me reioyse not of my liberte
þat seelden tyme is found in mariage
Ther I was free I mot bene in seruage
  
But naþelees I se ȝoure trewe entent
And trust vpon ȝou and haue don ay
Wherfore of my fre wille I assent
To wedde me as sone as euer I may
But þer as ȝe han profered me to day
To chese me a wif I ȝou relese
That chois and prei ȝou of ȝour propher cese
For god it wote þat children oft ben
Vnlike her worþi eldres hem bifore
Bounte commeþ al of god not of þe strene
Of which þei ben engendred and ybore
I Trust in goddys bounte and þerfore
My mariage and my astate and rest
I hym bitake he may do as hym lest
Lat me allone in chesing of my wiff
That charge vpon my bak I wil endure
But I ȝou prey and charge vpon ȝour lif
Þat wif þat I take ȝe me ensure
To worship hur whil our lyf endure
In worde and werke boþ here and ellys where
As she an emperours douȝter were
And ferþermore þis shullen ȝe swere þat ȝe
Aȝeinst my chose shul neiþer grucche ne stryue
ffor siþ I shal forgo my liberte
At ȝoure request as euer mot I thryue
Ther as myn hert is sette þer wil I wyue
And but ȝe wollen assent in such manere
I prey ȝou spekeþ no more of þis matere  
Wiþ harty wille þei sweren and assenten
To al þis þinge þer seide no wiȝt nay
Bisechinge hym of grace er þei wenten
That he hem wold graunten a certeyn day
  
Of his spousale as sone as euer he may
ffor ȝit alway þe puple somwhat dredde
Lesse þis Marquis wol no wif wedde
He graunted hem a day such as hym lest
On which he wolde be wedded sikerly
And seide he did al þis at her request
And þei wiþ humble entent ful buxomly
Knelinge vpon her knees ful reuerently
Hym þonken alle and þus þei han an ende
Of her entent and home aȝein þei wende
And here vpon he toke his officers
Commaundinge for þe fest to purueye
And to his privey knyȝtes and sqwiers
Such charge ȝaf hem  as hym lust on hem to leye
And þei his comaundementz to obeye
And ech of hem doþ his diligence
To done vnto þe fest reuerence
Nouȝt fer from þilk place honurable
wher as þis Marquis shope his mariage
þer stoode a Thrope of siȝt delectable
In which poor folk of þat vilage
Hadden her beestes and her harbigage
And of her labour toke her sustinaunce
After þe erþe hem ȝaue abundaunce
Among þise poor folk þer dwelled a man
which þat was holden porest of hem all
But hegh god somtyme sende can  
His grace vnto a litel oxes stall
Ianicula men of þat thrope hym calle
A doughter had he faire and ȝong of siȝt
And Grisild þis ȝonge maiden hiȝt
  
But forto speke of vertuous bewte
þan was she oon þe fairest vnder sonne
fful poorly yfostred was she
No licorousnesse was on her lust yronne
Wel ofter of þe well þan of þe tunne
She drank  and for she wole vertue plese
She knewe wel labour but non ydel ese
But þouȝe þis maide were tender of age
Ȝit in þe brest of her virginite
þere was enclosed ripe and sad corage
And in grete reuerence and in grete charite
Her olde poor fadere fostred shee
A fewe shepe spynnyng on þe felde she kept
She wolde not ben ydel til she sclepte
And whan she homward come she wolde bringe
wortes and herbes tymes ful oft
which she shradde and siþ for her lyuyng
And made her bedde ful hard and no þing soft
And euere she kept her faders lif on loft
wiþ euery obeisaunce and diligence
That childe may do to faders reuerence
Vppon Grisilde þe poor creature
fful oft haþ Marquis sette hys eye
As he on hundyinge rode perauenture
And whan it felle þat he myȝt hir espye
he not wiþ waton lokinge of foly
his eyen cast vpon hur but in sad wise
Vpon her chere he wold hym oft avise  
Commending in his hert her wommanhede
And eke her vertue passing eny wiȝt
Of so ȝonge age as wel in chere as in dede
ffor þouȝe þe puple haue no gret insiȝt
  
In vertue he considered ful riȝt
Her bewte and disposed þat he wold
Hir wedde if euer he wedde shuld
The day of weddyng come but no wiȝt can
Telle what womman it shuld be
ffor which mervaile wondred mony man
And seiden whan þei weren in priuete
wil not our lorde leue his vanyte
wil he not wedde alas alas þe while
whi wil he hym self and vs þus begile
But naþelees þis marquis haþ do make
Of Gemmes sette in gold and in asure
Broches and ryngges for grisild sake
And of her cloþing toke he þe mesure
Of a maide like to her stature
And eke of oþer ornamentes all
þat to such a wedding shul fall
The tyme of vndern þe same day
Approcheþ þat þis wedding shulde be
And all þe paleys putt was in aray
Both halle and chambres ech in his degre
Houses of office  stuffed wiþ grete plente
Þer maist þou see of deynteuous vitaile
þat may be found as fer as lasteþ ytaile
This rial Marquis rially araied
lordys and ladys in his companye
þe which to þe feest were preied   
And of his retenwe þe bachelerye
wiþ mony a soune of sondry melodye
vnto þe vilage  which I told
In þis aray þe riȝte way haþ hold
  
Griseld god wote of þis ful Innocent
þat for hure was shape al þis aray
To fecchen watere at þe welle is went
And commeþ home as sone as euer she may
ffor wel she herd say þat ilk day
þat Marquis shuld wedde and if she myȝt
She wold fayn see somme of þat siȝt
She þouȝt I wil wiþ oþer maidens stond
þat bene my felawes in oure door and see
The Marquis and þerfor wil I fonde
To done at home as sone as it may be
Þe laboure which þat longeþ vnto me
And þan may I at leisere it byhold
If she þis way to þe castel holde
And as she wolde ouer þe thresshold gon
The Marquis come and can hur forto calle
And she sette doune her water pot anon
beside þe thresshold of þe oxes stalle
And doun vpon her knees she gan to falle
And wiþ sadde countenaunce kneled stille
Til she had herde what was þe lordes wille
This þouȝtful Marquys spake vnto þis maide
wel soberly and seide in þis manere
where is ȝoure fader Griseld he seide
And she wiþ reuerence and meke chere
Answered lord he is al redy here
And Inne she gooþ wiþout lenger lette
And to þe Marquis she her fadere fette  
He by þe honde þan toke þis olde man
And seide him þus whan he hym had a side
Ianicula I neiþer may ne can
lenger þe plesaunce of myn herte hide
  
If þat ȝe vouchesauf what so betide
þi douȝter wil I take er þat I wende
As for my wif to my lyues end
Thow louest me I woot wel certeyn
And art my feiþful liege man ybore
And al þat likeþ me I dar wel seyn
It likeþ þe and specialy þerfore
Tel me þat poynt þat I haue seide byfore
If þat þowe wolde vnto þat purpoos drawe
To take me as for þine sone in lawe
The sodeyn caas þe man astonyed soo 
þat rede he wexe al basshed and al quakinge
He stood and vnneþes seide wordes moo
But only þus lord quod he my willinge
Is as ȝe wol not aȝeinst ȝour likinge
I wil no þinge ȝe be my lorde so dere
Riȝt as ȝou lest gouerneþ þis matere
Than wil I do þus quod Marquis softly
þat in to þe chambre I and þou and she
haue a collacion and woost þou why
ffor I wil aske hur ȝif hir wil be
To be my wif and rewle hir after me
And al þis she shal done in þi presence
I wil not speke out of þine audience
And in þe Chambere while þei were aboute
Her tretis which ȝe shul after here
Þe puple come into þe hous withoute
And wondred hem in howe honest manere  
And tentifly she kepte hur fadere dere
But vtterly grisild wonder myȝt
ffor neuere erst sey she shuch a siȝt
  
No wonder is þouȝe she be astonyed
To se so grete a gest come in þat place
She was neuere to suche gestys wonned
ffor which she loked wiþ ful pale face
But shortly fro þis matere forto pace
Thise were þe wordes þat þis marquis saide
To þis benygne verrey feiþful mayde
Grisyle he seide ȝe wol wel vnderstonde
It likeþ vnto ȝoure fadere and me
Þat I ȝou wedde and eke it may so stonde
As I suppose þat ȝe wil it so be
But þis demaunde I axe furst quod he
That siþen it shal be don on hastif wise
Wol ȝe assent or ellis ȝowe avise
I seye þis be ȝe redy with good hert
To al my lust and þat I frely may
As me best þenkeþ do ȝou lawgh or smert
And ȝe neuer gruch nyȝt ne day
And eke whan I seie ȝe say ȝe not nay
Neiþer be word ne fraward countenance
Swere þis and here I swere our aliance
WOndringe vpon þis worde quaking for drede
She seide Indigne and vnworþi
Am I to þat  þat ȝe me bede
But riȝt as ye wil ȝour self riȝt so wil I
And  I swere þat neuer willingly
In word ne þouȝt I neuere ȝou disobeye
ffor to be dede þouȝe me were loþe to deye
This is ynowe Grisile myn quod he  
And forþ he goþ wiþ a sobre chere
Out at þe door after cam she
And to þe puple he seide in þis manere
  
This is my wif quod he þat stondeþ here
Honoureþ hir and loueth  I prey
Who so loueþ me þer nys no more to seye
And for no þing of hure olde gere
She shuld bring to his hous he bade
þat wommen shulden spulen hir riȝt þere
Of which þe ladies were not riȝt glade
To handel her cloþes in which she was clad
But naþeles þis maiden briȝt of hwe
ffrom fote to hede ycloþed han al newe
Her heres han þei kembed þat lay vntressed
wel rwdely with her fyngeres smale
And a crowne on her hede þei han dressed
Isette ful of owches grete and smal
Of hir aray what shuld I make a tale
Vnneþes þe puple hir knewe for her fairnesse
Whan she transformed was in such richesse
 This Marquis haþ hure spoused wiþ a rynge
Bouȝt for þe same cause an þan hir sette
vppon an hors snowe white and wel amblynge
And to his palaies er he lenger lette
Wiþ Ioiful puple þat he lad and mette
Conveied hir and þus þe day þei spende
In reuel to þe sonne canne descende
And shortely forþ þis tale forto chace
I sey þat to þis newe Marquissesse
God haþ ysent such favour of his grace
þat it semed not as by liknesse
That she was born and fedde in rudenesse  
As in a Cote ar in an oxes stalle
But norshed in an Emperours halle
  
To euery wiȝt she woxen is so dere
And worshipful þat folk þer she was bore
And from her birth knewe her fro ȝere to ȝere
Vnneþ trowed þei but durst haue swore
þat to Ianicle of which I speke byfore
She douȝtere ne were for as by coniecture
hem þouȝt she was a noþer creature
ffor  þat euere vertuous was she
She was encresed in such excellence
Of thewe sette in high bounte
And so discrete and faire of eloquence
So benygne and digne of reuerence
And coude þe puples hertes so enbrace
þat ech her loued þat loked on her face
Nouȝt only of saluce in þe toun
Publisshed was þe bounte of her name
And eke beside in mony a regioun
If oon seide wel anoþer seide þe same
So spradde of hure bounte þe fame
That men and wommen boþ ȝonge and olde
Goon to saluse hur to beholde
This walter  lowly nay but ryally
weddeþ wiþ fortune honeste
In goddes pees lyuen wel esely
At hoom and outward grace ynoȝe had he
And for he sawe vnder lowe degre
was oft vertue hid þe puple hym helde
A prudent man and þat is sene wel selde
Nouȝt only Grisile þus þorgh her witte
Couþe al þe fete of wively humblenesse  
But eke whan þe cas required it
The comon profite coude she redresse
  
Ther nas no discord rancour ne heuynesse
In al þe londe þat she ne coude it cese
And bring hem al wisely in rest and ese
Though þat hur husbond present were anon
ȝif Gentil men or oþer of her contre
were wrooþ she cowde bringe hem at on
So wise and rype wordes had she
And Iuggement of so grete equite
That she fro heuene was as men wende
Puple to saue and euery wrong tamende
Not longe tyme aftere þat þis grisild
Was wedded she a douȝter haþ ybore
Al had she leuer born a knaue child
Glad was þe Marquis and his folk þerfore
ffor þouȝe a mayde childe come al byfore
She may to a knaue childe atteyne
By liklihede siþens she is not bareyne
Therfor as it falleþ tymes moo
That þis childe haþ sowked but a thrawe
This marquis in his hert longeþ so
To tempte his wif her sadnesse to knowe
Þat he ne myȝt fro his hert throwe
Þis merveilous desire his wif tassay
Naþelees god wote he þouȝt hir to affray
He had assaied hir ynouȝe tofore
And fonde hur euer good what nedeþ It
Hir forto torment and alway more and more
þouȝe somme preise it for a subtile witte
But as for me I saie þat euel it sitte  
To assaie a wif whan it is no nede
And putten hure in angwissh and in drede
  
For which þis Marquis wrouȝt in þis mare
He came a nyght alon þer as she lay
wiþ steerne face and trouble chere
And seide þoo Griseld quoþ he þat day
þat I ȝou toke out of ȝoure poor aray
And putte ȝou in estate of hie noblesse
ȝe han not ȝit forȝeten as I gesse
I seye Griseld þis present dignite
In which I haue put ȝou as I trowe
Makeþ not ȝou forȝetful forto be
þat I ȝou toke in poor estate ful lowe
ffor eny þinge ȝe mote ȝoure seluen knowe
Take hede of euery word þat I ȝou seie
ther is no wiȝt þat hereþ þis but we tweye
Ȝe wote ȝour self wele howe þat ȝe come here
Into þis hous it is not long ago
And þouȝe to me ȝe be leef and dere
vnto my gentiles ȝe be no þing so
þei seyn to hem it is grete shame and woo
fforto be sogette and in seruage
To þe þat art born of so lowe lynage
And namely siþ þi douȝter was bore
þise wordes han þei spoke doutlees
But I desire as I haue don byfore
To lyve my lif wiþ hem in rest and pees
I may not in þis cas bene rechelees
I most don wiþ  douȝtere for þe best
nouȝt as I wold but as my gentils lest
And ȝit god woot þis is ful loþ to me
But naþeles wiþ outen ȝour wetynge  
I nyl not doo but þis I wil quod he
þat ȝe to me assent as in þis þinge
  
Sheweþ now ȝoure pacience in ȝour worchinge
That ȝe me byhiȝt and swore in ȝour vilage
That day þat maked was our mariage
Whan she had herde al þis she was not amoued
Neiþer in word or chere or countenaunce
ffor as it semed she was not agreued
She seid lorde all lith in ȝoure plesaunce
My childe and I wiþ hertely obeisance
Bene ȝoures all and ȝe may saue and spille
ȝoure owne þing wheder þat ȝe wille
Ther may no þinge so god my saule saue
likinge to ȝou þat may displese me
Ne I desire no þinge to haue
Ne drede to lese saue only ȝe
This wille is my hert and ay shal be
No length of tyme or deþ it may deface
Neiþe chaunge my corage into oþer place
Glad was þe Marquis of hur answering
But ȝit he feyned as he were not so
Al drery was his chere and his lokinge
whan she shuld out of þe chamber goo
Sone after þis a forlong way or twoo
he pleynly haþ told his entent
Vnto a man which he to his wif sent
A maner sergeaunt was þis privey man
þe which þat feithful fond yhad
In þingges grete and eke such folk wel can
Don execucion of þingges bad
þe lord knewe wel þat he hym loued and drad
And whan þis sergeaunt wist his lordes will  
Into þe chambere he stalked hym ful still
  
Madame he seide ȝe mote forȝeue it me
þough I do þinge to which I am constreyned 
Ȝe bene so wise þat wel knowe ȝe
þat lordes heestes may not be feyned
þei mowen wel be wailed or compleyned
But men mote nede vnto her lust obeye
And so wil I þer nys no more to seye
That childe I am commaunded to take
And spake no more but out þe child he hent
Despitously and gan a chere make
As he wold han slayn it þer he went
Griseld mot al suffre and al consent
And as a lombe she sitteþ meke and stille
And lete þis cruel Seriaunt haue his wille
Suspecte was þe name of þis man
Suspecte his face  suspecte his world also
Suspecte þe tyme þat he þis bygan
ffor his douȝter þat she loued soo
She wende he wold haue slayn it riȝt þoo
But naþelees she neiþer wepte ne seide
Confeermyng hur to þat þe Marquis seide
And at þe last speke she bygan
And nekely to þe sergeant preide
So as he was a worþi gentil man
þat she myȝt kisse her childe er þat it deide
And in her barme þis litel childe she leide
wiþ ful sadde face and gan þe childe to blisse
And lulled it and after gan it kisse
And þus she seide in her benigne voys
fare wele my child I shal þe neuere see
But siþ I haue Marked þe wiþ croys
Of þilk sadere yblessed mot þou be    
þat for vs deyed vpon þe rood tre
þi soule litel childe I hym bytake
ffor þis nyȝt shalt þou dyen for my sake
I trowe þat to a norice in þis caas 
It had ben hard þis rewþe forto see
Wel myȝt a modere þan cry alas 
But naþeles so sadde and stedfast was she
Þat she endured al hur aduersite
And to þe Sergeant meke she seide
Haue here aȝein my litel ȝonge maide
And goþ now quod she and doþ my lordes heest
And oon þinge wold I prei of ȝoure grace
That but my lorde forbede ȝou at lest
Burieþ þis litel body in som place
Þat no beestes no briddes it torace
But he no word to þo purpoos wold saye
But toke þe childe and went vpon his way
This Sergeant come to þe lord ageyn
And of Griseldes wordes and of her chere
He tolde hym poynt by poynt in short and pleyn
And hym presented wiþ his douȝter dere
Somwhat þis lord had rawþe in his manere
But naþelees his purpoos helde he stille
As lordes don whan þei wil han her wille
And bad þis Sergeant ful priveily
he shuld ful soft þis child welde and wrappe
with al þe circumstance tenderly
And carie it in a coffre or in a lappe
But vp peyn his hede of for to swappe
þat no man shuld knowe of his entent
Ne whens he come ne whidere he went
  
 But at Boloyne to his suster dere  
þat þoo of Pavie was countesse
He shuld her take and shew hir þis matere
Bisechinge hure to don her bysynesse
This childe to fostere in al gladnesse
And whoos childe þat it was he bad hir hide
ffrom euery wiȝt for ouȝt þat myȝt betide
This Sergeaunt goþ and haþ fulfilled þis þinge
But to þis marquis nowe retourne we
ffor nowe goþ he wel oft ymagynynge
If by his wif  he myght See
And by hir wordes perceyue þat she
Were chaunged but he coude neuere fynde
But euere in oon ylik sad and kinde
As glad as humble as bysy in seruise
and Eke in loue as she was wont to be
Was she to hym in euery manere wise
Ne of her douȝter oon worde speke she
Noon accident for noon aduersite
Was seen in hir ne neuere her douȝter name
Nempned she for ernest ne for game
In þis estate passed ben foure ȝere
Er she wiþ child was but as god wold
A knaue childe she bere by þis waltere
fful gracious and faire to biholde
And whan folk it to hir fadere tolde
Not oonly he But al þe contree mery
Was for þe child and god þei þonke and herye
Whan it was two ȝere olde and from þe brest
Departed from his norce vpon a day
þis Marquis kaught ȝit anoth lest
  
To tempten his wif ofter if he may
O nedeles was she tempted in assay  
But wedded men knowen no mesure
Whan þei fynde a pacient creature
Wyf quod þis Marquis ȝe herd er þis
My puple sekely bereþ our mariage
And namely siþen my sone born is
Now it is wors þan euer in our age
þe murmur sleeþ myn her and my corage
ffor to myn eres comeþ þe vois so smerte
þat it wel nye destroieþ al my herte
Now seye men þus · whan walter is a goon
þan shal þe blood of Ianicle succede
And bene our lord for oþer haue we nōn
Such wordes seyn my puple it is no drede
Wel ouȝte I of such murmur taken hede
ffor certeynly I drede such sentence
þouȝe þei not pleynly speke in myn audience
I wold lyue in pees if þat I myȝt
Wherfore I am disposed vtterly
As I his sustere serued by nyȝt
Riȝt so I þenke to serue hym prively
Þus warne I ȝou þat ȝe not sodeynly
Out of ȝoure self for no woo shuld outray
Beþ patient and þerof I ȝou pray
I haue quod she seide  and euere shall
I wil desire no þing certeyn
But as ȝou lust not greueth me at all
þouȝe þat my douȝtere and my sone be sclayn
At ȝoure comaundement þis is to sayn
I haue had no parte of children tweyn
But furst siknesse and after woo and peyn
  
Ȝe be our lord doo with ȝour owe þinge
Riȝt as ȝou lust and askeþ no rede of me  
ffor as I left at home al my cloþinge
whan I come first to ȝou riȝt so quod she
left I my will and al my liberte
And toke ȝoure cloþing wherfore I ȝou prey
Do ȝoure wille I wille to it obeye
And certes ȝif I had prescience
ȝoure will to knowe or ȝe ȝoure lust me told
I wold it done wiþ oute necligence
But now I wote ȝoure lust and what ȝe wolde
Al ȝoure plesaunce feerme and stable I hold
ffor wist I þat my deþ wold do ȝou ese
Gladly wil I suffre it ȝou to plese
Deth may make non comparisoun
Vnto ȝoure loue and whan þis Marquis say
þe constance of his wiff he cast his hede adoun
And his eyen two and wondred how she may
In such penaunce suffre al þis array
And forþ he goþ wiþ drery countenance
But to his hert it was ful grete plesannce 
This ege sergeant in þe same wise
þat he her douȝtere kaught riȝt so he
Or wors if he coude wors devise
Haþ kaught hire childe þat was ful of bewte
And euere in oon so pacient was she
þat she no chere made of hevynesse
But kiseþ her sone and after can hym blesse
Saue þis she preide him if þat he myȝt
hir litel sone he wold on erþe graue
his tendere lymmes delicat to siȝt
ffro fowles and beestes forto saue
  
But she noon answere of hym myȝt haue
He went his way as he no þing wrouȝt  
But into boloyne tendrely it brouȝt
This Marquis wondreþ euere lenger þe more
Vpon her pacience and if þat he
Ne had soþly knowe þerfore
þat parfitly her children loued she
He wold haue wende þat of some sotilte
And of malice or cruel corage
That she had suffred þis with sad visage
Wut he knewe þat next hym self certayn
She loued her children best in euery wise
But nowe of wommen wold I aske fayn
ȝif þise assaies myȝt not suffise
what cowde a stordy husbond  devise
To preue her wifhode and her stedfastnesse
And be contynuyng in stordynesse
But þer ben folk of such condicion
Þat whan þei han a certeyn purpoos take
Þey con not stinte of her entencion
But as þei were bounden to a stake
þei wil not of þat purpoos sclake
Riȝt so þis marquis haþ fully purposed
To tempten his wif as he was first disposed
He waiteþ if by woordes or countenance
Ȝif she to hym was chaunged of corage
But neuere coude he fynde variance
She was euere in hert and in visage
And euer þe ferþer þat he was in age
þe more trewer if it were possible
She was to hym in loue and more penyble
  
For which it semeþ þus þat of hem twoo
Ther was but oon will for as walter lust
The same lust was her plesaunce also  
And god be þonked al felle for þe best
She shewed wel for no worldly vnrest
A wif as of her self no þinge shuld
Willen in effecte but as her husbond wold
The sclaundere of waltere oft wide sprad
That a cruel hert wickedly
ffor he a poor womman wedded had
Haþ morþered boþ his children priuely
which murmur was amonge heme comonly
No wonder was for to þe puples eere
þer come no worde but þat þei murþered were
For swich as of his puple þerbifore
had loued hym wel desclaundred of his name
Made hem þat þei hated hym therfore
To bene a murdrere is an hatful name
But naþelees for ernest ne for game
He of his cruelte wold not stynte
To tempte his wif was al his entente
Whan þis douȝtere xij ȝere was of age
he to þe courte of Rome in sotile wise
Enformed of his wille sent his massage
Comaunding hem such billes to devise
As to his cruel purpoos may suffise
howe þat þe pope for his puples rest
Bad hym wedde anoþer wif if þat hym lest
I sey he bad þat þei shuld counterfete
þe popes billes making mencion
Þat he haþ leue his first wif to lete
As by þe popes dispensacion
  
To stinte rancoure and dissencion
Bitwix þe puple and hym þus speke Þe bulle
The which Þei han publissshed at þe fulle  
The rude puple as no wonder is
Wende ful wel it had be riȝt soo
But þise tydyngges commen to griseld is
I deme þat her hert was ful woo
But she was ylike sad euermoo
Disposed was þis humble creature
Þe aduersite of fortune al to endure
Abydinge euer his lust and his plesance
To whom she was ȝeuene hert and all
As to her worldely suffisaunce
ffor certeynly for his story telle I shall
This Marquis ywriten haþ in speciall
A lettre in which he sheweþ his entent
And sikerly he it to boloyne sent
To þe Erle of Pavie which þat he had so
wedded his sustere he preide specialy
To bringen him aȝein his children two
In honurable estaat al openly
Bot of on þing he hym preide al vtterly
That he to  wiȝt þough men wold enquere
Shuld not telle whoos children þei were
But seide þat þe mayde shuld wedded be
Vnto þe Marquis of Saluce anon
And as þe erle was preide so did he
ffor at a day Isette he on his way is gon
Toward Saluse and lordes mony on
In riche aray þis maide forto gyde
Hir yonge broþer ridyng by hir side
  
Araied was towardes þis mariage
This mayde fressh ful of gemmys clere
Hir broþer that vij ȝere was of age
Araied eke was fresshly on his manere  
And in grete noblesse and glad chere
Toward Saluce shapinge her iournay
ffrom day to day þei riden forþ her way
Amonge al þis aftere his wikked vsage
This Marquys ȝit his wif to tempten more
To þe vttrest preef of his corage
ffully to haue experience and lore
ȝif þat she were as stedfast as bifore
he on a day in open audience
wel boistously haþ seide hir þis sentence
CErtes Griseld I had ynowe plesaunce
To han ȝou to my wif for ȝoure goodnesse
And for ȝoure treuth and ȝour obeysaunce
Nouȝt for ȝoure lynage ne for ȝoure ricchesse
But it is now knowen in verray soþnesse
þat in grete lordship if I wil avise
Ther is grete souereynte in sondry wise
I may not done as euery plowe man may
My puple me constreynen forto take
A noþer wiff and crien day by day
And eke þe pope rancour forto sclake
Consenteþ it þat dar I vndertake
And trewly þus moch wil I ȝou say
My newe wif is commyng by þe way
Be stronge of hert and voide anon her place
And þilk dowary þat ȝe brouȝt to me
Take it aȝein I graunte it of my grace
  
Retourneþ to ȝoure faders hous quod he
No man may alway haue prosperite
wiþ euene hert I rede ȝou to endure
þe stroke of fortune or of auenture
And she aȝein answerde in pacience  
My lord quod she I wote and wist alway
howe þat I swore ȝou magnificence
And my pouert no man can ne may
Maken noon comparison it is no nay
I helde me neuere digne in no manere
To be ȝoure wif ne ȝit your chambrere
And in þis hous þer ȝe me lady made
þe high god take I for my witnesse
So wisly as he my soule glade
I helde me neiþer lady ne maistresse
But humble seruaunte to ȝoure worþinesse
And euere shal while my lif may endure
Abouen euery worþi creature
That ȝe so longe of ȝour benygnite
haue holde me in honure and in nobleye
where I was not worþi forto be
þat þonk I god and ȝou  whom I prey
fforȝeelde it ȝou þer nys no more to sey
Vnto my fadere gladly wil I wende
And wiþ hym dwelle to my lyves ende
Ther as I was fostred a child ful small
Til I be dede my liff  wil I lede
A widowe clene in hert body and all
ffor siþen I ȝaf to ȝou my maydenhede
And am ȝoure trewe wif it is no drede
God shild such a lordes wif to take
Anoþer man to husbonde or to make
  
And of ȝour newe wif god of his grace
So graunte ȝou welþe and prosperite
ffor I wil gladly ȝeeld hir my place
In which I was blisful wont to be
ffor Siþen it likeþ ȝou my lord quod she  
That whilom weren al my hertes rest
That I shal goon I wil goon whan ȝou lest
But þer ȝe me profre such dowarie
As I furst brouȝt it is wel in my mynde
It were my wrecched cloþes no þing faire
þe which to me nowe were ful hard to fynde
How god howe gentile and how kinde
Ȝe semed by ȝoure spech and ȝour visage
þe day þat maked was oure mariage
But soþ is seide algate I finde it trewe
ffor in effecte is proued nowe on me
Loue is not olde as whan it is newe
ffor certes lord for non aduersite
To dyen in þis cas it shal not be
That in worde or werk I shal repent
þat I ȝou ȝaue myn hert in good entent
My lorde ȝe wote þat in my faders place
Ȝe diden me stripen out of my poor wede
And richely ȝe cladden me of ȝoure grace
To ȝou brouȝt I not ellis out of drede
But fait nakednesse and maidenhede
But here aȝein ȝoure cloþing I restore
And eke my weddyng ringe for euermore
The remenaunte of ȝour Iwels redy be
wiþ in ȝour chambre dare I it seyuely seye
Naked out of my faders hous quod she
I come and naked I mote turne ageyne
  
Al ȝoure plesaunce wil I folowe feyne
But if I hope it be not ȝoure entente
þat I smoklees out of ȝoure paleis went
Ȝe cowde not do so dishonest a þinge
That ilk wombe in which our children lay  
Shuld byfore þe puple in my walkinge
Be seyn al bare wherfor I ȝou pray
lat me not like a worm gon by þe way
Remembre ȝou myn  owne lorde so dere
I was ȝoure wif þouȝe I vnworþi were
Wherfore in guerdon of my maidenhede
Which þat I wrouȝt and not aȝein bere
As voucheþ sauf to ȝeue me to my mede
But such a smokke as I was wont to were
þat I þerwiþ may hille þe wombe of here
þat was ȝoure wif and here I take my leue
Of ȝowe myn owne lord lest I ȝou greue
The smok quod he þat þou hast on þi bak
Lat it be stille and bere it forþ wiþ þe
But wel vnneþ þat word he spak
But went his way for reuthe and pite
Byfore þe folk hure self stripeþ she
And in her smok wiþ hede and fete al bare
Toward her fadres hous forþ is she fare
The folk folowed weping in hir way
And fortune euere þei cursed as þei gon
But she from weping kept her eyen day
Ne in þis tyme word spak she non
Her fader þat here of herd anon
Cursed þe day and tyme þat nature
Shope him to be a lyues creature
  
For out of doute þis olde poor man
was euer suspecte of her mariage
ffor euer he demed siþen it bygan
Þat whan þe lord yfylled had his corage
hym wold þenk it was a desparage
To his astate so lowe to a liȝt  
And voiden hir as sone as euere he myȝt
Aȝeinst his douȝtere hastely goþ he
ffor he by þe noys of folk knewe her commyng
And wiþ her olde cote as it myȝt be
He keuereþ hir ful sorowfully wepinge
But on hur body myȝt he it not bringe
ffor rude was þe cloþ and more of age
By dayes fele þan hur mariage
Thus with her fadere for a certeyn space
dwelleþ þis floure of wively pacience
That neuer by her wordes ne be her face
Bifore þe folk ne in her absence
Ne shewed she þat to hir was don offence
Ne of hie astate in remembraunce
Ne had she as by her countenaunce
No wonder is for in  grete estate
Her goost was euere in pleyn humilite
No tender mouþe ne hert delicate
Ne pompe ne semblant of Rialte
But ful of pacience and benygnite
Discrete and pruydeles and euere honurable
And to her husbonde euere meke and stable
Men speke of Iob and most of his humblesse
As clerkes whan hem lust can wel endite
Namely of men but in soþfastnesse
þouȝe clerkes preise wommen but a lite
  
þer can no man in humblesse hem aquite
As wommen can ne ben half so trewe
As wommen bene but it be fallen newe
Fro babyloyne is þis Erle of Pavie come
Of which þe word spronge to more and lesse
And to þe pules eeres al and somme
was couþe eke a newe Marquyssesse  
He wiþ hym brouȝt in pompe and such ricchesse
þat was neuere sey wiþ mannys eye
So noble aray in Westlombardye
The Marquis þat Shope an knewe al þis
Er þat þis erle was commen sent his massage
ffor cely poor Gryseldys
And she with humble hert and glad visage
Nouȝt wiþ swollen hert in her corage
Come at his heest and on here knees her sette
And reuerently and wisely she hym grette
Griseld quod he my will is vtterly
þis maide þat shal wedded be vnto me
Resceyued be to morowe as Really
As it is possible in my hous to be
And eke þat euery wiȝt in his degre
Haue his estate in sittyng and seruise
And also plesaunce as ȝe can best deuyse
I haue no womman suffisant certayn
Þe Chambres to aray in ordynaunce
After my lust and þerfor wil I fayn
Þat þine were al such gouernaunce
Þou knowest eke of olde al my plesaunce
þouȝe þine aray be bad and euel ysey
Do þou þi deuoyre at þe lest wey
  
Nouȝt only lord þat I am glad quod she
To do ȝoure lust but I desire also
ȝoure forto plese and serue in my degre
Without fayntise and shal euermoo
Ne neuer for no wele ne for no woo
Ne shal þe goost within my hert stynt
To loue ȝou best with al my trewe entent
And wiþ þat word she gan þe hous to diȝt  
And tables to sette and beddys to make
And peyned hure to doo al þat she myȝt
Preying þe chambreres for goddis sake
To hasten hem and fast swope and shake
And she þe most seruisable at all
Haþ euery ychambre araied and his halle
Aboute vndern gan þis Erle aliȝt
That wiþ him brouȝt þise noble childre tweie
ffor which þe puple ranne to se þat siȝt
And hure araye so richely beseye
And þan at arst amonges hem þei gon seye
That walter was no foole þough hym lest
To chaunge his wiff for it was for þe best
For she is fairrer as þei demen alle
Than is Grisell and more tender of age
And fairrer fruyte bytwene hem shuld falle
And more plesaunt for hir hiȝe lynage
Hir broþer so faire was of his age
þat hym to seen þe puple had kauȝt plesaunce
Commendyng nowe ȝe Marquis gouernaunce
O sterne puple vnsad and trewe
Euere vndiscrete and chaungyng as a fane
Delitinge euere in Rumour þat is newe
ffor like þe mone euere wexe ȝe and wane
  
Euere ful of clapping dere ynowe a Iane
Ȝour dome is fals ȝour constance euel preueþ
A wel grete fool is he þat on ȝou leueþ
Thus seiden sadde folk in þat Cite
Whan þat þe puple gased vp and doun
ffor þei were glad riȝt for þe nouelte
To make a newe lady of her toun
No more of þis make I mencioun  
But to griseld aȝein wil I me dresse
And telle her constance and her bysynesse
Wel bysy was gryseld in euery thinge
þat to þe feest was pertinent
Riȝt naught was she abasshed of her cloþinge
þouȝe þei were Rude and eke somdel torent
But wiþ glad chere to þe gate is went
wiþ oþer folk to greten þe Marquissesse
And after doþ she forþ her bysynesse
Wiþ ful glad chere þe gestes she receyueþ
And Boxomly euerich in his degre
That no man defawte þer perceyueþ
But euere þei wondren what she myȝt be
That in so poor aray was forto se
And cowde such honure and reuerence
And worþely þei preisen her prudence
In al þis me while she ne stynte
This maiden and eke her broþer to commend
Wiþ al her hert and benigne entente
So wel þat no man koude her prise amende
But at þe last whan at þise lordes wende
To sitten a doun he gan to calle
Griseld as she was bysy in þe halle
  
Griseld quod he as it were in play
How likeþ þe my wif in her bewte
Riȝt wel quod she my lorde for in good fay
A fairrer sawe I neuere non quod she
I prey to god so ȝeue ȝou prosperite
And so hope I he wil to ȝou sende
Plesaunce ynouȝe to ȝoure lyues ende
Sut oon þing I biseche and warne also 
þat ȝe prik wiþ no tormentynge  
þis tendere mayden as ȝe han don moo
ffor she is fostred in her norshynge
fful tenderly in her ȝong pleyynge
She coude not aduersite endure
As coude a poor fostred creature
And whan þis Walter segh her pacience
her glad chere and no malice at all
And he so oft haþ done hir offence
And she euer constant and sad as a wall
Contynuyng euer her innocence ouerall
This stordy marquis gan his herte dresse
To Rwe vpon hur wifly stidfastnesse
This is ynouȝe Griseld myn quod he
Be no more agast ne euel apayde
I haue þi feiþ and þi benignyte
As wel as euer womman was asaied
In grte astate and poorly araied
Now knowe I dere wiff þi stedfastnesse
And hure in armes toke and gan to kesse
And she for wonder toke þerof no kepe
She herd not what þing þat he seide
She ferde as she had stert out of her sclepe
Til she out of þe maisednesse abreide
  
Griseld quod he by god þat for vs deyde
þou art my wif and noon oþer I haue
Ne neuere had as god my soule saue
This is þi douȝter which þou hast supposed
To bene my wif and noon oþer feiþfully
shal bene myn heir as I haue euere disposed
Thowe bere hem in þi body trewly
At boylen haue I kepte hem sikerly
Take hem aȝein for þou myȝt not seyn  
þat þow hast lorn eny of þi children tweyn
And folk þat oþerwise han seide of me
I warne hem wel þat I haue done þis dede
ffor no malice ne for no cruelte
But forto assay þi wommanhede
And not forto scle my children god forbede
But forto kepen hem prively and stille
Til I þi purpoos knewe and al þi wille
And whan she þis herd adoun in swowe she falleþ
ffor pitous ioying and after hire swowinge
She boþ her yōnge children to hure calleþ
And in hure armes pitously wepinge
Enbrased boþ tenderly kissynge
Wel like a modere wiþ her salt teeres
She baþed boþ her visage and her heeres
O such a pitous þinge it was to see
Her sownyng and her pitous vois to here
Gramercy my lord god y thenk ȝou quod she
þat ȝe han saued me my children dere
Now rech I neuere to be dede riȝt here
Siþ I stonde in ȝour loue and in ȝour grace
No force of deþ ne whan my spirit pace
  
A tender o dere o ȝenge children myn
Ȝoure wooful modere wende stedfastly
Þat cruel houndes or some vermyn
Had eten ȝou but god of his mercy
And ȝoure benigne fader tenderly
Haþ done ȝou kepte and þat same stounde
Al sodeynly she swapte doun to þe grounde
And hin her swowne so sadly holdeþ she
her children two whan she gan hem brace
That wiþ grete scleight and difficulte  
The children from her armes gan þei to rase
O mony a tere o mony a pitous face
Doun ranne of hem þat stoden hyr beside
Vnneþ aboute hur myȝt þei abide
Walter hir vptakeþ and her sorowe gladeþ
She ariseþ vp al abasshed from her trance
And euery wiȝt hir Ioye and feest makeþ
To she haue kauȝt aȝein her countenance
Walter her doþ so feiþfully plesaunce
þat it was deynte for to se þe chere
Bitwixe hem two nowe þei bene mette in fere
Thise ladys whan þei her tyme say
han taken hur and into chambre gone
And stripen hir out of her rude aray
And in a cloþe of gold þat brighte shone
wiþ a crowne of mony a riche stone
vpon hur hede þei hir into halle brouȝt
And þer she was honoured as she ouȝt
Thus haþ þis pitous day a blisful ende
ffor euery man and womman doþ his myȝt
This day in myrþe and reuel to dispende
Til on þe welken shoon þe sterres briȝt
  
ffor more solempne in euery mannys siȝt
This fest was and gretter of costage
Þan was þe reuel of þe mariage
fful mony a ȝeer in high prosperite
lyuen þise two in concord and in rest
And richely his douȝter maried he
Vnto a lord on of þe worþiest
Of all ytaile and þan in pees and rest
His wifes fader in his courte he kepeþ
Til þat his soule out of his body crepeth  
His sone entreþ into his heritage
In rest and pees aftere his faders day
And fortunate was eke in mariage
Al putte he not his wif in assay
This world is not  stronge it is no nay
As it haþ bene in olde tymes ȝore
And harkeneþ what þe auctour seiþ þerfore
Þis storie is seide not þat wives shuld
ffolowe Gryseld as in humilite
ffor it were importable þouȝe þei wold
But þat euery wiȝt in his degre
Shulde be constant in aduersite
This storie which he wiþ high stile enditeþ
Wiþ pacience Griseld he qwiteþ
ffor siþens a womman was so pacient
Vnto a mortall man moch more we ouȝt
Resceyue alle in gree þat god vs sent
ffor grete scelys he preueþ þat he bouȝt
Mankynde þe which þat he wrouȝt
As seiþ seint Iame if ȝe his pistel rede
He preueþ folk al day it is no drede
  
And suffreþ vs as for our exercise
Wiþ sharpe shoures of aduersite
Wel ofte to be leten in sondry wise
Nowe forto knowe vs for certys he
Er we were born knewe al our freelte
And for our best is al our gouernaunce
Lat vs it haue þan in vertuous suffrance
But oo witte harkeneþ lordyngges er ȝe goo 
It were ful harde nowe adayes
In al a toune fynde Griseldys þre or two
ffor if þei were putte in such assaies
þe gold of hem haþ nowe so hard alaies
Wiþ bras þat þouȝe þe kynde be faire atte ye
It woll raþer brast a two þan plye

whos lyf and al hirs  swete god maynteigne
In high maistrie  and ellis were it skath
I wil with lusty hert  fressh and grene
Say now a song  to gladde yow I wene
And late vs stynt  of Ernestful matiere
Herknyth my song  that saith in this manere  
GRiseld is dede and eke her pacience  
And boþ at onys yburied in Ytalie
ffor which I cry in open audience
No wedded man be hardy to assaile
His wyves pacience in trust to fynde
Griseldes for in certeyn he shal faile
  
O noble wyues ful of hegh prudence
lat none humilite ȝoure tonge nayle
Ne lat no clerk haue cause ne diligence
To write of ȝou a storie of such mervaile
As of griselde pacient and kynde
lest Chychyuache ȝou swelowe in hir entraile
Foloweþ ekko þat holdeþ no silence
But euere answereþ at þe countretale
Beþ not bydaffed for our Innocence
But sharpely take on ȝou þe gouernaile
Emprinteþ wel þis lesson in ȝoure mynde
ffor Comon profit sith it may availe
NE drede hem nouȝt doth hem no reuerence
ffor þouȝe þine husbonde araied be in maile

Shal perce his brest and eke his aduentale
In Ialowsie I rede eke þou hym bynde
And þat þou shalt make hym couche as doþ a quale
If þou be faire þere folk bene in present
Shewe þou þi visage and þine apparaile
If þowe be fowle be free of þi dispence
To gete þe freendes ay do þi travaile
Be aye of chere as liȝt as leef on lynde
And lat hym care and wepe and wryng and waile
Ȝe Arche wiffes stondeþ at ȝour defence
Siþ ȝe bene stronge as is a grete camaile
Ne Suffreþ not þat man do ȝou offence
And sclendere wyves feble as in bataile
Beth egre as a tygre ȝende in Ynde
Ay Clappeþ as a mylle I ȝou counsaile

EHY goddis mercy seide oure hoost þoo 
Alle euel wyues god kepe vs fro
ffor mony scleiȝtes and subilites
Bene in wommen þat bene euere bisy as bees
Vs foly men forto desceyue
ffor from þe soþ euere wil þei weive
By mony ensamples it proueþ well
But doutelees as trewe as eny stele
I haue a wiff þough she poor be
But of her tunge a labbyng shrew is she
And she haþ an hepe of vices moo
þerof no force lat al such þingges goo
But wete ȝe what in counsaile be it saide
Me reweþ sore þat I am to her teide
ffor and I shuld rekne euey vice
Which þat she haþ ywis I were not wis
And cause whi for it shuld reported be
And tolde to hure of somme of þis mayne
Of whom it nedeþ not to declare
Siþ wommen kon out such chaffare
And eke my witte suffiseþ not þerto
To telle alle þerfore my tale is doo
Sir ffrannkeleyne come ner if it ȝour wille be
And say vs a tale for sertys ȝe
Can þeron as moch as eny man
Nay sir quod he I wil say as I can
With hertely wille for I nyl be rebelle
Aȝeinst ȝoure wille  a tale nowe wil I telle
HAue me excused ȝif I sey amys
My wille is good and loo my tale is þis ·
Thise olde gentile bretoynes in her daies
Of dyuers auentures maden laies
Rymeden in her furst bretoyne tonge
Which layes wiþ her instrumentes þei songe
Oiþer ellis radden hem for her plesance  
And oon of hem haue I in remembrance
Which I shal seie wiþ as good wille as I can
But sirs by cause þat I am but a burill man
At my bygynnynge furst I ȝou biseche
Haue me excused of my rwde speche
I lered neuere rethorike certeyne
þinge þat I speke it mot be bare and pleyne
I slepte neuere on þe mounte of parnaso
Ne I neuer lered  Marchus Tullius ne Cithero
Colours of rethorike knewe I none without drede
But such coloures as growen in þe mede
Or ellis such as men dye or peynt
Colours of rethorike bene to me queynt
Mi spirit feleþ not of such matiere
But if ȝou lust my tale shul ȝe here
Ther was a knyght þat loued and did his peyne
In armorike þat cleped is breteyne
To seruen a lady in his best wise
And mony a laboure and mony a grete emprise
  
He for his lady wrouȝt er she were wonne
ffor she was oon þe fairest vndere sonne
And eke þerto come of so high kynrede
þat wel vnneþes durst þis knyght for drede
Telle hure his woo his peyne and his distresse
But at þe last she for his worþinesse
And namely for his meke obeysance
Haþ suche a pite kauȝt of his penaunce
That prively she felle of his acorde
To take hym for hure husbond and her lord
Of suche lordship as men han ouer her wyves
And forto lede þe more in blisse her lyves
Of his fre wille he swore hure as a knyȝt
þat neuere in his wille by day ne nyȝt
Ne shuld vpon hym take no maistrie
Aȝeinst her wille ne kith hure Ialousie
But hure obeye and folowe her wille in all  
As eny louyere to his lady shall
Saue þat þe name of souereynte
That wolde he han for shame of his degre
She þonkeþ hym and wiþ ful grete humblesse
She seide sir siþ of ȝoure gentylnesse
ȝe profre me to han as large a reyne
Ne wolde neuere god betwix vs tweyne
As in my gilt were eiþer werre or striff
Sir I wil be ȝoure owne humble and trewe wiff
Haue here my trouþe til þat my hert brest
Thus bene þei boþ in quiete and in rest
ffor oon þinge sires saufly dar I seie
That frendes euerich oþer most obeie
ȝif þei wil longe holde companye
loue wil not bene constreyned be maistrye
whan maistrie commeþ þe god of loue anōn
Beteþ on his wengges and farewele he is gon
loue is a þinge as eny spirite free
Wommen of kynde desiren liberte
  
And nouȝt to be constreyned as a þrall
And so done men ȝif I þe soþe seie shall
Loke who þat is most pacient in loue
He is at his avauntage aboue
Pacience is an hie vertue certeyn
ffor it venquyssheþ as clerkes seyne
Thingges þat rigoure shulde neuere ateyne
ffor euery worde men may not chide ne pleyne
Lerneþ to suffre or ellis so mote I gon
ȝe Shul it lerne wheder ȝe wil or non
ffor in þis world certeyne no wiȝt nys
þat he ne doþ or seiþ some tyme amys
Or oþer siknesse oiþer constellacion
Wyne woo or chaunchynge of complexion
Causeþ ful oft to do amys eiþer speken
On euery wronge men may not be awreken
Aftere þe tyme most be temperaunce  
To euery wiȝt þat can no gouernaunce
And þerfore haþ þis worþi wise knyȝte
To lyue in ease suffrance hure bihiȝte
And she to hym ful wisely gan to swere
þat neuere shuld þer be defaute in here
Here may men seen an humble wif acord
Thus haþ she take her seruaunte and her lord
Seruaunte nyl on and lord in mariage
þan was he boþ in lordship and seruage
Seruage nay but in lordschip alloue
Syþens he haþ boþ his lady and his loue
His lady certys and his wiff also
The which þat lawe of loue accordeþ þerto
And whan he was in þis prosperite
Home wiþ his wiff he goþ to his cuntre
Not fer fro Pedmarke þer as his dwelling was
Where as he lyueþ in blisse and in solas
Who couthe telle but he had wedded be
The Ioie þe ease and þe prosperite
  
That is bitwix an husbond and his wiff
A ȝere and more lasted þis blisful lif
Til þat þis knyȝt of which I spake of þus
That of kynrede was cleped Arueragus
Shope hym to goon and dwelle a ȝere or tweyn
In engelond þat cleped was breteyn 
To seche in armes worship and eke honour
ffor all hit lust he sette in such labour
And dwelleþ þere þe boke seiþ þus
Now wil I stint of þis Arueragus
And speken I wil of dorygen his wiff
That loueþ her husbonde as his hertes lif
And for his absence wepeþ she and sikeþe
As done þise noble wyues whan hem likeþ
She mourneþ wakeþ waileþ fasteþ and playneþ
Desire of his presence hure so destreyneþ
That all þis wide world she sette at nouȝt  
Her frendes which þat knewe her hevy þouȝt
In al þat euere þei myȝt or may
þei prechen hur þei tellen hur nyȝt and day
þat causelees she sleeþ her self alas
And euery comfort possible in þis cas
They doon to hure wiþ al her bysynesse
And al forto make hure late her heuynesse
By processe as ȝe knowe wel euerechon
Men may so longe grauen in þe ston
Til some figure þerInne emprinted be
So longe han þei conforted hure þat she
Resceyued haþ by hope and by reson
The emprintyng of hure constellacion
Thorgh which here grete sorowe gan aswage
She may not alway endure in such a rage
And eke arueragus in al þis care
Haþ sent her lettres home in al þis fare
And þat he wold come hastely aȝein
Oyþer ellis had þis sorowe hure hert sclayn
  
Her frendes segh hure hert gan to sclake
And preiden hure on knees for goddys sake
To come and to Rome hure in companye
Away to dryve hure derk fantasie
And fynaly she graunted þat request
ffor wel she seghe it was for þe best
Nowe stoode hure castel fast by þe see
And oft wiþ hure frendes walked she
Hire to disporte on þe See bank on hegh
Where as she mony shippe and barge segh
Seilynge her cours where hem lust to goo
But ȝit was þer a parcelle of her woo
ffor to hure self ful ofte seide she
Is þer no shippe of so mony as I see
wil bringe home my lord þan wold my herte
Al warisshe of þise bittere peynes smerte
Anoþer tyme þer wil she sitte and þenke  
And cast her yen downward fro þe brinke
But whan she segh þe grissly rokkes blake
ffor verrey fere wold hure hert quake
þat on her fete she myȝt not hure sustene
þan wold she sitte doune on þe grene
And pitously into þe see she wolde biholde
And seyn riȝt þus with soroweful hert cold
Eterne god þat þourgh þi purueaunce
Ledest þe worlde by certeyn gouernaunce
In ydelnesse as men sayne ye no þinge make
But lorde þise grisly feendly rokkes blake
That semen raþer a foule confusion
Of werk þan eny faire creacion
Of which a parfit god and a stable
why han ȝe wrouȝt þis werk vnresonable
ffor by þis werk souþe norþ eest and west
Ther nis yfostred man ne bridde ne beest
It doþ no good to my witte but anoyeþ
Se ȝe not lorde how mankynde it destroieþ
  
An C thousand bodies of mankynde
Han rokkes sclayn al be þei nouȝt in mynde
Which mankynde is so faire part of þi werke
þat þow it maidest like to þine honde werke
þan semed it ȝe had a grete cheerte
Toward mankynde but how þan may it be
þat ȝe suche menes make it to destroien
Which menes done no good but euer anoyen
I wote wel clerkys wollen seyn as hem lest
By argument þat al þing is for þe best
þough I ne can þe causesse forsoþ knowe
But þilk god þat made wynde to blowe
As kepe my lorde þis is my conclusion
To clerkes lete I al disputacion
But wolde god þat all þe rokkes blake
Were sonken into helle for his sake
Thise rokkes scleen myn hert for fere  
Thus wold she sayn wiþ mony a pitous tere
Hire frendes segh þat  was no disport
To Romen by þe see but discomfort
And shopen for to pleyen somwher ellis
They leden hure by ryuers and by wellys
And eke in oþer places delitables
Thei daunsen and pley atte chesse and tables
So on a day riȝt on þe morowe tyde
Vnto a gardyne þat was þer beside
In whiche þat þei had made her ordinaunce
Of vitaille and of oþere purueaunce
They goon and pleien hem al þe longe day
And þis was on þe sext morowe of may
Which may had peinted wiþ his softe shoures
This gardeyn ful of leues and of floures
And wiþ craft of mannys honde so curiously
Araied had þis gardyne traily
That neuere nas þer gardyne of such prise
But ȝif it were þe verrey paradyse
  
The odour of floures and þe fresshe siȝt
Wold haue made eny pensif hert liȝt
That euere was born but if to grete siknesse
Oiþer to grete sorowe helde it in distresse
And aftere dynere gan þei to daunce
So ful it was of bewte wiþ plesaunce
And syngen also but dirigen song allone
And made alway her compleinte and her mone
ffor she ne segh him in þe daunce goo
þat was her husbonde and her loue also
But naþelees she most a tyme abide
And wiþ good hope lete she her sorowe glide
 Vpon þis daunce amonges oþer men
Daunsed a squier afore Dorigen
Þat fressher was and Iolier of araye
As to my dome þan is þe monþe of may
He syngeþ and dounseþ passinge eny man  
Þat is or was siþens þis world bygan
Þerwiþ he was if men shuld hym discrive
On þe best faring man alyue
Ȝong strong riȝt vertuous riche and wis
And wel byloued and holden in grete pris
And shortely if þe soþ tellen I shal
Vnwittyng of þis Dorigen at all
This lusty squyere seruaunte to Venus
Which þat icleped was aurelius
Had loued hure best of eny creature
Two ȝere and more as was his auenture
But neuere durst he telle of his greuaunce
Wiþout cuppe he dronke al his penaunce
He was despeired no þing durst he saye
Sauf in his sawe somwhat wold he wreye
His woo as in generall compleynyng
He saide he loued and was byloued no þing
Of suche matere made he mony laies
Songges compleyntes roundelettes virrelaies
  
How þat he durst not his sorowe telle
þat languyssheþ as a fuyre doþ in helle
And deye he seide most I as did Ekko
ffor Narsisus þat durst not telle hure woo
In oþere manere þan ȝe here me saye
Ne durst he not to hure his woo bywrey
Saue perauenture somtyme at daunces
þere ȝonge men kepen her obseruaunces
It may wel be he loked on hure face
In such a wise as man þat askeþ grace
But no þinge wiste she of his entent
Naþeles it happed er þei þens went
Bycause þat he was hure neighbour
And was a mon of worship and honour
And had yknowe hym oft tymes ȝore
þei fylle in speche more and more
Vnto his purpoos drowe aurelius  
And whan he segh his tyme he saide þus
Madame quod he by god þat þis world made
So þat I wist it myȝt ȝoure herte glade
I wold þat day þat ȝoure arueragus
Went to þe see þat I Aurelius
Had went þat I shuld neuere come aȝein
ffor wel I wote my seruise is in veyn
My gwerdon is but brestyng of myn herte
Madame reweþ vpon my peynes smerte
ffor as wiþ a swerde ȝe may me scle or saue
Here at ȝoure fote god wolde I were in graue
I haue as nowe no leisere forto seie
Haue mercy on me swete or ȝe wil do me die
She gan to loke vpon Aurelius
Is þis ȝoure wille quod she and saye ȝe þus
Neuer erst quod she ne wist I what ȝe ment
But nowe Aurely I knowe ȝoure entent
By þilke god þat ȝaf me soule and liff
Ne shal I neuere be an vntrewe wiff
  
In worde ne werk as fer as I haue witte
I wil bene his to whom þat I am knytte
But aftere þat in pleyn þus seide she
Take þis for fynal answere as for me
Aurely quod she by hiȝe god aboue
Ȝit wil I graunte ȝou to be ȝoure loue
Siþþe I see ȝou so pitously compleyne
Loke what day þat euenlong breteyne
ȝe remeue alle þe Rokkes stoon by stoon
þat þei lat shippe ne bote none
I saye whan ȝe han made þise costes so clene
Of Rokkes þat þer be no stone sene
þan wil I loue ȝou best of eny man
Haue here my trouþe in al þat euere I can
Is þere noon oþer grace quod he
No by þat lorde quod she þat made me
ffor wel I wote þat shal neuere betide  
Lat such foly out of ȝoure hert glide
What deynte shuld man haue be his lif
fforto loue anoþere mannys wiff
þat haþ hure body whan þat hym likeþ
Aurelius ful ofte sore sikeþ
Woo was Aurelius whan he þis herde
And wiþ a sorowful hert þus answerde
Madame quod he þis were an impossible
þan mote I deye a sodeyne deþe horrible
And wiþ þat worde he turned hym anōn
Tho come hire oþer frendes mony on
And in the aleis romed vp and doun
And no þing wist of þis conclusioun
But sodeynly bygonne to reuel newe
Til þat þe briȝte sonne lost his hwe
ffor þorisonth haþ raft þe sonne his liȝt
This is as moche to say as it was nyȝt
And home þei gone in Ioie and in solace
Saue only wrecched Aurelius allas
  
he to his hous is gone wiþ sorowful herte
he seiþ he may not from his deþ asterte
Hym semeþ he feleþ his hert colde
Vp to þe heuene his hondys gan he holde
And on his knees bare he sette hym doun
And in his raving seide þis Orisoun
ffor verrey woo out of his witte he breide
He nyst not what he spake but þus he seide
Wiþ pitous hert haþ he compleynt bygon
Vnto þe goddesse and first vnto þe sonne
He seide Appollo god and gouernour
Of euery planete  herbe  tree and flour
Þat ȝeuest aftere þi declinacion
To ech of hem his tyme and his seson
And þine harborowe chaungeþ lowe and hie
Lord Phebus cast þi merciable ye
On wrecched Aurely which þat am but lorne  
loo lord my lady haþ my deþ sworne
Wiþoute gilt but þi benignite
Vpon my dedly herte haue somme pite
But wel I wote lorde phebus if ȝou lest
Ȝe may me helpe to haue my lady best
Now voucheþ sauf þat I may ȝou devise
How þat I may be hulpe and in what wise
Ȝoure blisful sustre lucyna þe Shene
Þat of the see is cheef goddes and quene
Þouȝe Neptynus haue deite in þe See
Ȝit Emperesse abouen hem is she
Ȝe knowen wel lord riȝt as hure desire
Is to be qwykkened and liȝtned of ȝour fire
ffor which she folweþ ȝou fu bisily
Riȝt soo þe See desireþ naturelly
To folowen hure as she þat is goddesse
Boþe in þe See and in þe Ryuere more and lesse
Wherfore lorde phebus þis is my requeste
Do þis myracle or do myn herte tobrest
  
That nowe next at þis opposicion
Whiche in þe signe shal be of þe lyon
As preie hure so grete a floode to brynge
þat v fathme at þe leest it ouere sprynge
þe hiest rokke in harmorike Bretaigne
And lat þis flode endure ȝeres tweyne
Than certis to my lady may I saye
Holdeþ ȝoure heeste þe rokkes ben awaye
Lord Phebus do þis miracle for me
Preie hure she goo no faster cours þan ȝe
I seie þowe þus preie ȝoure sustre þat she go 
No fastere cours þan ȝe þise ȝeres two
þan shal she be euere at þe ful alway
And springe floode lasteþ boþ nyȝt and day
And but she vouchesauf in such manere
To graunte me my lady souereyn dere
Preie hure to synken euery rokke adoun  
Into hure owne derk regioun
Vndere þe grounde þer Pluto dwelleþ Inne
Oiþere neuere more shal I my lady wynne
Thi temple in Delphos wil I barefote seke
Lorde Phebus biholde ȝe þe teeres of my cheke
And of my peyne haue compassioun
And wiþ þat worde in swoune he fille adoun 
And longe tyme he lay in a traunce
his broþer which þat knewe of his penaunce
Vp kauȝt hym and to bed hym brouȝt
Despeired in his torment and his þouȝt
Loo I þis wooful creature lye
May chese whedere to lyve or dye
 Arueragus wiþ hool and grete honour
As he  was of chyualrie þe floure
Is commen home and oþer worþi men
O blisful art þou Doregen
þat hast þine lusty husbond in þine armes
þat fresshe knyght þat worþi man of armes
  
þat loueþ þe as his owne hertys lif
No þing lest he to be ymagynatiff
þouȝe eny wiȝt had spoke while he was oute
To hure of loue he made þerof no doute
He nouȝt entendeþ to no such matere
But daunseþ  Iusteþ  and makeþ good chere
And þus in Ioye and blisse I lat hem dwelle
And of þe swete Aurelius wil I telle
In langour and in furious torment þus
Two ȝere and more lay wrecched aurelius
Or eny foote on erþe he myȝte gon
No comfort in þis tyme nad he non
Sauf of his broþere which þat was a clerke
he knewe of all þis woo and al þis werke
ffor to non oþer creature certeyn
Of þis matere ne durste he no worde seyn
Vndere his brest he bere it more secree  
Than euere did phamphilius for galathe
His brest was hoole wiþouten for to sene
But in his herte was ay þe arowe kene
And wel to knowe þat afore Sanure
In Surgery ful perilous is þe cure
But men myȝt not touche þe arowe þouȝe he come þerby
His broþer wepeþ and weilleth prively
Til at þe last hym felle in remembrance
That whiles he was at orliance in france
As ȝonge clerkes þat bene likerous
To reden artes þat bene curious
Seken in euery halke and euery herne
Particulere sciences forto lerne
He him remembreþ vpon a day
At Orliaunce in stody a boke he saie
Of magike naturel which his felawe
þat was þat tyme a bachilere of lawe
Al were he þere to lerne anoþer craft
And priuely vpon his desk he laft
  
This boke which speke mochel of operacions
Touchinge þe  mancions
þat longen to þe mone and such foly
As in our daies nys nat worþ a flye
ffor holy churche seiþ in our bileue
Ne suffreþ noon illusion vs to greue
And whan þis booke was in remembraunce
Anone for ioy he gan to daunce
And to hym self saide priuely
My broþer shal be warisshed hastely
ffor I am siker þat þer bene sciences
By which men make dyuers apparences
whiche as þise subtile tregetours pleien
ffor oft at feestes haue I herde seyen
That tregetours wiþin an halle large
Han maden come water in a barge
And in the halle rowe vp and doune  
Somtyme haþ semed  a grete lyoun

Somtyme a vyne and grapes whyt and reede  
Somtyme a castel al of lyme and ston
And whan hen liked voide it anon
Thus semed it to euery mannys siȝt
Now þan conclude I þus if þat I myȝt
At Orliaunce some olde felawe finde
þat had þe moons mancions in mynde
Oiþer magike naturel aboue
He shuld wel make my broþer han his loue
ffor wiþ apparens a man may make
To mannys siȝt þat alle þe Rokkes blake
Of Bretoyne were ywent euerechon
And þat shippes by þe brinkes myȝt commen and gon
And in such forme enduren a ȝere or twoo
þan were my broþer warsshed of his woo
þan moste she nedis knowe hure byhest
Or ellis he shal shamen hure at þe lest
  
What shuld I make a lenger tale of þis
Vnto his broþer bedde commen he is
And suche comforte he ȝaue hym forto gon
To orliaunce þat he vpstert anon
And on his way forþward is he fare
In hope to bene ylissed of his care
Whan þei were come almost to þat cite
But if it were a two forlonge or þree
A ȝonge clerk romyng by hemself þei mette
Whiche þat in latyn thriftely hym grette
And aftere þat he seide a wonder þinge
I knowe quod he þe cause of ȝoure commynge
And er þei forþer eny foote went
He tolde hem all þat was in her entent
þis bretoyne clerke hym asked of ffelawes
þe whiche þat he had knowe in olde daies
And he answered hym þat þei dede were
ffor whiche he wept ful mony a tere
Doune of his hors Aurelius liȝt anōn  
And forþ wiþ þis Magicien is he gōn
Home to his hous and made hem wel at eese
Ham lackeþ no vitaile þat hem myȝt plese
So wel an araied hous as ther was on
Aurelius in his lif ne segh none
He shewed hem ere  went to sopere
fforestis and parkes ful of wilde dere

The grettest  that evir wer seyne with eye
He sauhe of hem an hundred  slayne wyth houndes
And som with arwes  bleede of bytter woundes
He sauhe whanne wyde were the wylde deer
The fauconers vpon a fayr ryver  
And howe facouns han þe herowne sclayn
þat segh he knyghtes iusten in a playn
And aftere þis he did hym such plesaunce
þat he hym shewed his lady in a daunce
  
On which him self daunsed as hym þouȝt
And whan þis maistere þat þis magike wrouȝt
Segh it was tyme and clapped his hondys twoo
A fare wele al oure reuel is ydoo
But ȝit remeue þei neuere out of þis hous
whiles þei seghe al þis siȝt merveilous
But in his stody þere as his bokes be
þei sitten stille and no wiȝt but þei þre
To him þis maastere called þan a sqwiere
And seide him þus is it redy oure sopere
Almost an houre it is I vndertake
Siþens I ȝou bad oure sopere to make
Whan þat þise worþi men wenten with me
Vnto my stody þer as my bokes be
Sir quod þis squiere whan it likeþ ȝou
It is al redy þouȝe ȝe will riȝt nowe
Go we þan soupe quod he and for þe best
þise Amerous folk somtyme mote haue rest
And after sopere fille þei in trete
What somme shulde þis maisters guerdon be
To reme alle þe Rokkes of breteyne
And eke from geron to þe mouþe of Seyn
He made it straunge and swore so god hym saue
Lasse þan a þousand pounde he nolde not haue
Ne gladly for þat somme he nold not goon  
Aurelius wiþ blisful hert anon
Answered þus  fie on a thousand pounde
This wide world þat men seyn is rounde
þat wold I ȝeue if I were lord of it
This bargayn is ful drive for we bene knyt
ȝe shullen be paide trewly be my trouþe
But lokeþ nowe for no negligence ne slouþe
ȝe tary vs here no lenger þan to morowe
Nay quod this clerke haue here my trouþe to borowe
To bedde is gone Aurelius whan hym list
And welnygh al þat nyȝt he had his rest
  
þat for his laboure and for his hope of blisse
His wooful herte of penaunce had a lisse
Vpon þis morowe whan þat it was day
To breteigne toke þei þe right way
Aurelius and þis magicien be side
And bene descended þer þei willen abide
And þis was as þe bokes me remembre
þe colde frosty seson of decembre
Phebus wexe olde and hwed like laton
That in his hote declinaciōn
Shoone as þe byrned cold with stremes briȝt
But nowe in scorpion adoune he liȝt
Where as he shone ful pale I dar wel seyn
þe bitter frostes with þe sclete and reyn
Destroied haþ þe grene in euery ȝerde
Ianus sitte by þe fuyr with double berde
And drynkeþ of his bugle horn þe wyne
Byforn hym stant þe brawne of þe tusked swyne
And a nowell crieþ euery lusty man
Aurelius in al þat euere he can
Doth to his maister chere and reuerence
And preieþ him to don his diligence
To bringgen him out of his peynes smerte
Oiþere wiþ a swerde þat he wold sclitte his herte
That subtile clerk which þat rouþe had of þis man  
þat nyght and day he him spedde þat he ne lan
To waite a tyme of his conclusion
This to say to make illusion
I ne can no termes of Astrologie
By whiche an apparence of Iogelrie
þat she and euery wiȝt shuld wene and seie
That of Breteyn þe rokkes bene away
Oiþere ellis þei were sonken vnder grounde
So at þe last whan he his tyme founde
To make his iapes and his wrecchednesse
Of which a supersticious cursednesse
  
His tables colletanes forþ he brouȝt
fful wel corrected for þer lacked nouȝt
Ne his collectis ne his expans ȝeres
Ne his rotes ne his oþer geres
As bene his Centrys and his argumentz
And his proporcions conuenientz
ffor his equaciōns and euery þinge
And by his viiij spere in his wirkinge
He knewe howe fer alnaþe was yshoue
ffrom þe hede of þilk fixe ariseþ aboue
þat in þe  spere considered is
fful subtily he calleþ al þis 
And whan he had founde his first manciōn
He knewe þe remynaunte by proporciōn
And knewe þe arising of þe mone well
And in whoos face and terme euery dell
And knewe ful wel þe monys mancion
Accordant to his operaciōn
And knewe also his oþer obseruaunces
ffor such illusions and such meschaunces
As heþen folk vsed þilk daies
ffor which no lenger maked he delaies
But þorgh his magike for a weke or tway
It semed as al the Rockes were away
Aurelius which þat despeired is  
whedere he shal han his loue or fare amys
Awaiteþ nyȝt and day of þis myracle
And whan he knewe þer was non obstacle
þat voiden were þise rokkes euerechon
Doune to þis maisters fete he fille anon
And seide I woful wreche Aurelius
Thonke ȝou lorde and lady myne Venus
That me han hulpe from my carys cold
And to þe temple forþ his way haþ hold
Where he knewe he shuld þis lady se
And whan he segh his tyme anon riȝt he
  
With dredful herte and humble chere
Salwed haþ his souereyn lady dere
My riȝtful lady quod þis wooful man
Whom I most drede and loue as I best can
And loþest were of al þis world displese
Nere it þat I for ȝou haue suche dissese
That I most dye here at ȝoure fote anon
 But not wolde I telle howe me is woo bygon
But certes eiþer most I deye or pleien ·
Ȝe slee me giltelees for verrey peyne
But of my deth þouȝe ye haue no rouþe
Avise ȝou er þat ȝe lese ȝoure trouþe
Repenteþ ȝou for þilke god aboue
Er ȝe me sleen by cause þat I ȝou loue
ffor madame wel ȝe wote þat ȝe han hiȝt
Not þat I chalence eny þing of riȝt
Of ȝou souereyn lady but ȝour grace
But in a gardyne ȝonde in such a place
Ȝe wote riȝt wel þat ȝe bihote me
And in myn honde ȝoure trouþe bliȝt ȝe
To loue me best god wote ȝe saide so
Al be þat I vnworþi am þerto
Madame I seie it for þe honure of ȝou ·
More þan to saue myn hertes lif riȝt nowe
I haue done as ȝe comaunded me  
And if ȝe vouchesauf ȝe may go see
And as ȝou lust haueþ ȝoure bihest in mynde
ffor qwikke or dede riȝt þus ȝe shullen me finde
In ȝou lif all to do me lyve or deye
But wel I woote þe rockes bene aweye
He toke his leue and she astonyed stode
In al her face þer nas on drope of blood
She wende neuere han commen in such a trappe
Allas quod she þat this euere shuld happe
ffor wende I neuere by possibilite
þat such a meschaunce shuld euere be
  
It is aȝeinst þe processe of nature
And home she goþ a soriful creature
ffor verrey fere vnneþes may she goo 
She wepeþ and weilleþ a day or twoo
And swowneþ þat it rauthe was to see
But whi it was to no wiȝt tolde she
ffor out of toune was goon Arueragus
But to hure self she seide and speke þus
In hure compleynte as ȝe shul aftere here
With face pale and wiþ soriful chere
Allas quod she on þe fortune I playn
þat vnware hast wrapped me in þi chayn
ffor which þe eskape wote I no socour
Saue only deþ eiþer dishonour
Oon of þise two bihoueth me to chese
But naþelees ȝit had I leuer lese
My lif þan of my body to haue a shame
Eiþer knowe my self fals eiþer lese my name
And wiþ my deþ I may be quytte Iwis
Han þer nat mony a wif er þis
And mony a maiden sclayn her self allas
Raþer þan wiþ her bodies done trespas
And certes loo þise stories beren witnesse
Whan xxxti tirauntz ful of cursednesse
Had sclayn Phidon in Athenes at þe lest  
They commaunded his douȝters to arest
And bringgen  byforn hym in despit
Al naked to fulfille her foule delite
And in her faders bloode þei made hem daunce
Vppon þe pauement god ȝeue hem meschaunce
ffor which þise wooful maidens ful of drede
Raiþer þan þei wolde lese her maidenhede
þei prively bene sterte into a welle
And dreinte hem self as þe bokes telle
Thei of mesue lete enquere and seke
Of lacedemye l maidens eke
  
On which þei wolden don her lecherie
But was þer none of al þat companye
þat she nas sclayn and wiþ a glad entent
Chese þe raþere to die þan to assent
To bene enpressed of her maidenhede
Whi shuld I þan to dye bene in drede
Lo eke þe tiraunte Austoclides
þat loued a maiden which hiȝt Symphalides
Whan þat hure fadere sclayn was on a nyȝt
Vnto Dianes temple goþ she anon riȝt
And hent þe ymage wiþ hure armes twoo 
ffrom which ymage she nolde neuer goo
No wiȝt myȝt fro hit hure handis race
Til she was sclayn in þe self place
Nowe siþens þat maidens had such despit
To bene defouled wiþ mannys foule delite
Wel ouȝte a wiff raþere hure self slee
þan ben defouled as þenkeþ me
What shal I sayn of hasdrubaldys wif
þat at Cartage biraft herself hur liff
ffor whan she segh þat Romayns wan þe toun
She toke her chuldren alle and swept adoun
Into þe fuyre and ches rather to dye
þan eny Romayn did hure vilenye
Haþ not lucres ysclayn hure self allas  
At Rome þere she oppressed was
Of Tarquyne for hure þouȝt it was a shame
To live whan þat she had lost her name
The viij maidens of Melefie also 
Han sclayn hem self for drede and woo 
Raþer þan folk of gaule shuld hem oppresse
Moo þan a M1 stories as I gesse
Couþe I nowe telle as touching þis matere
Whan habradas was sclayn his wif so dere
Her self sclowe and lete her blood to glide
In Habradas woundes brood and wide
  
And saide my body at þe leeste waye
Ther shal no wiȝt defoile if þat I may
What shuld I moo ensamples herof sayn
Siþen þat so mony han hem self sclayn
Wel raþer þan þei wolde defowled be
I wil conclude what is best for me

I wilbe trewe  vnto Arueragus  
Eiþer raþer slee my self in some manere
As did Demonycions douȝtere dere
By cause þat she nolde defoiled be
O Cedasus it is ful grete pite
To reden how þi douȝters deiden allas
þat sclowe hem self for suche manere cas
As grete appetit was it or more
The theban maiden þat for Nichasore

Another theban mayden dide right so  
Hure had wedded and sore dressed
For oon of Masidoigne had hure oppressed
What shal I seyn of Nicharatyfs wiff
þat for such caas biraft her self her lif
Howe trewe was eke to Alcebiades
His loue þat forto dyen  ches
þan forto suffre his body vmbreided be
Loo which a wif was alcesteyn quod she
What Emore of good Penoloþe
Alle Grece knoweþ of her chaastite
Parde of leodomya is written þus  
That whan a Troy was sclayn protheselayus
No lenger nold she lyf aftere his day
Þe same of noble porcia telle I maye
Wiþouten brutus quod she not lyve
To whom he had alhole hure herte ȝeue
The parfit wifhode of Archemesie
Honoured is þorgh alle þe barberye
  
O teuta quene in þi wifly chastite
To alle wives may þou a myrour be
   
    
Thus playned Dorigen a day or tweye
Purposinge euere þat she wolde deye
But naþeles vpon þe þred nyȝt
Home came Arueragus þe worthi knyȝt
And asked hure whi þat she wepte so sore
And she gan wepen euere þe lenger more
Allas quod she þat euere was I borne
Thus haue I seide quod she þus haue I sworn
I tolde hym alle as ȝe han herde bifore
It nedeþ not rehersen it hereof no more
This husbonde wiþ glad chere in sondry wise
Answerde and seide as I shal  devise
Is þer ouȝt ellis Dorigen but þis
Nay nay quod she god helpe me so as wisse
Þis is to moche if it were goddes wille
ȝe wiff quod he lat sclepe þat is stille
It may be wel ȝit perauenture to saye
Ȝe shullen ȝoure trouþe holden be my fay
ffor god so wisly helpe me
I had wel leuere ystikked forto be
ffor verrey loue which I to ȝou haue
But ȝif ȝe shuld ȝoure trouthe Saue
Trouþe is þe hiest þing þat man may kepe
But wiþ þat word he brast anōn to wepe
And seide I ȝou forbede in peyn of deth
That neuer whiles ȝou lasteþ lif and breth
To no wiȝt telle of þis cure  
As I may I most my lif endure
Ne make no countenaunce of heuynesse
Þat folk of ȝou may deme harme or gesse
And forþ he clepeþ a sqwiere and a mayde
Goþ forþ anon with Dorigen he saide
  
And bringeþ hure to such a place anon
Thei toke her leue and on her way þei gon
But þei ne wiste whi she thider went
He nolde no wiȝt telle hure entent
     
    
    
    
    
    
This Sqwier which þat hiȝt Aurelius
On dorigen which þat was so amerous
Of auenture happed hure to mete
Amydde þe toune riȝt in þe qwikke strete
As she was boune to goo þe way forþ riȝt
Toward the gardeyn þer as she had hiȝt
And he was to þe gardeyn ward also
ffor wel he aspied whan she wolde goo
Out of her hous to eny manere place
But þus þei mette by auenture or grace
And he salueþ her wiþ glad entent
And axed of hure whidere þat she went
And she answerd half as she were madde
Vnto þe Gardyne as myn husbond badde
My trouþe forto hold allas allas
Aurelius gan wondere of þis cas
And in his hert had grete compassion
Of hure and of her lamentacion
And of Arueragus þe worþi knyȝt
þat bad hure holde al þat she hight
So loþe he was hys wiff sholde breke her trouþe
And in his hert he cast of þis grete routhe
Consideringe þe best on euery side
þat from his lust hym were better abide
Than done so high a cherles wrecchednesse
Aȝeinst fraunches and al gentilnesse
  
ffor which in fewe wordes seide he þus  
Madame seiþ to ȝoure lorde Arueragus
Þat siþen I se his grete gentilnesse
To ȝou and eke I see wel ȝoure distresse
If ȝe by me shulde breke ȝoure trouþe
Certes me þenkeþ it were grete rouþe
I haue wel leuer euere to suffre woo
þan I departe þe loue ytwix ȝou twoo
I ȝou relese madame into ȝoure honde
Quite euery surement and euery bonde
That ȝe han made to me as here biforn
 Siþens þilk tyme þat ȝe were born
My trouþe I pliȝt I shal ȝou neuer repreef 
Of no biheest and here I take my leue
As of þe trewest and þe beste wiff
þat euere ȝit I knewe in al my liff
And euery wiȝt be ware of hure bihest
On Dorygen remembreþ at þe leste
Thus can a squyere don a gentile dede
As wel as can a knyȝt wiþoute drede
She þonked hym vpon hure knees al bare
And home vnto hure husbonde is she fare
And tolde hym alle as ȝe han herd me seide
And be ȝe siker he was ful wel apaide
It were impossible to write
What nedeþ lenger in þis cas endite
 Arueragus and Dorigen his wiff
In souereyn blisse leden forþ her lif
Neuer aftere was þer anger hem bitwene
He Shershed hure as þouȝe she were a quene
And she was to hym trewe for euermore
Of þise two folk ȝe gete of me no more
 Aurelius þat his cost haþ forlorn
Curseþ þe tyme þat euere he was born
Allas quod he alas þat I bihiȝt
Of pured gold a thousand pounde of wiȝt
  
Vnto þis philosople how shal I doo  
I se no more but þat I am fordoo
Mine heritage most I selle
And bene a begger here I may not dwelle
And shamen al my kynrede in þis place
But I of him may gete better grace
But naþelees I wil of hym assaie
At certeyn dayes ȝere by ȝere to paie
And þonke him of his grete curtesie
My trouþe wil I kepe I wil not lie
Wiþ herte sore he goþ vnto his cofre
And brouȝte golde vnto þis philysophre
þe value of v C pounde I gesse
And hym bisecheþ of his gentilnesse
To graunte hym daies of þe remenaunte
And saide maistere I dar wel make auaunte
I failled neuere of my trouþe ȝit
ffor sikerly my dette shal be quytt
Towardes ȝou how þat euere I fare
To goon a begger in my kirtel bare
But wolde ȝe vouche sauf vpon swerte
Two ȝere or þre forto respite me
Þan were I welle for ellis mote I selle
 Myn heritage þer nys no more to telle
This Philisophre soberly answerde
And seide þus whan he þis word herde
Haue I not holde conaunte vnto þe
Ȝis certes wel and trewly quod he
hast þou not had þi lady as þe likeþ
No no quod he and sorily he sikeþ
What was þe cause telle me ȝif þou can
Aurelius his tale anon bygan
And tolde hym alle as ȝe han herd bifore
It nedeþ not to rehercen it no more
He saide Arueragus of gentilnesse
Had leuere dey in sorowe and distresse
  
Than his wif were of hure trewþe fals  
The sorowe of dorigen he tolde hym als
Howe loþe hire was to be a wicked wiff
And þat she leuere þat day lost hure liff
And þat hure trouþe she swore þourgh Innocence
She neuere erst herde speke of apparence
That made me han of hure so grete pite
And riȝt as frely as he sent hire me
As freely sent I hire to hym aȝein
This is alle and some þer nys no more to seyn
This Philisophre answerd leue broþer
Euerich of ȝou did gentilich til oþer
Thou art a squyere and he a knyȝt
But god forbede for his blisful myȝt
But if a clerk couþe do a gentile dede
As wel as eny of ȝou it is no drede
Sir I relece þe þi þousand pounde
As þow riȝt nowe were cropen out of þe grounde
Ne neuere er nowe haddest þou knowe me
ffor sir I nyl not take a peny of þe
ffor al my craft and my travaile
þow hast ypaied wel for my vitaile
It is ynowe and fare wele and haue good day
And toke his hors and forþ he goþ his way
 Lordingges þis question wil I aske nowe
Which was þe most free as þenkeþ ȝou
Nowe telleþ me er þat I forþer wende
I Can no more my tale is at an ende
The mynystere and þe norice vnto vices
Which þat men clepen in englissh ydelnesse
The porter of þe gate is of delices
To eschewe and by her contrary hure oppresse
þat is to sayn by leeful bysynesse
Wel ouȝt we to don our entent
Lest þat þe feend þorgh ydelnesse vs shent  
For he þat wiþ his þousande cordes scliȝe
Continuelly vs waiteþ to beclappe
Whan he may man in ydelnesse aspie
He can so liȝtly cacche him in his trappe
Til þat a man be hent riȝt by þe lappe
He nys nat ware þe fende haþ hym on hond
wel ouȝt vs worch and ydelnesse wiþstond
And þouȝe men dradden neuere forto deye
ȝit seen men wel by resoun doutelees
That ydelnesse is roten scloggardye
Of whiche þer neuere commeth non encrees
And siþens þat sclouth hure holdeþ in a lees
Only to sclepe and forto ete and drinke
And to devouren alle þat oþere swynke
  
And forto putten vs from such ydelnesse
That cause is of þe grete confusion
I haue here done my feiþful bysynesse
Aftere þe legende in translaciōn
Riȝt of þi glorious lif and passion
Thow wiþ þi garlond wrouȝt of rooses and lilie
The mene I maiden and marter seint Cicile
And þou þat floure of virgynes art alle
Of whom þat Barnard lust so wel to write
To þe at my bygynnyng furst I calle
Thou comforte of vs wrecches do me endite
þine maidens deþ þat was þorgh þi merite

Certes men may aftere reden in his storie
Thow maiden and modere douȝter of þi sone
Thow welle of mercy synful soules cure
In whom þat god for bounte chees to wone
Thowe humble and hegh ouere euery creature

That no desdeyn þe maker had of kynde

WiþInne þe cloystere blisful of þi sidys  
Toke mannys shappe þe eterne loue and pees

Whom erþe and see and heuene wiþ out relees
Ay heryen and þou virgyne wemlees
Bare of þi body and dwellest maiden pure

Assembled is in þe magnificence
Wiþ mercy goodnesse and such pite
That þou arte þe sonne of excellence
Nouȝt only helpest hem þat preien þe
But oftetyme of þi benignyte
fful frely er þat men þine helpe biseche

Now helpe þou meke and blisful faire maide
Me flemed wrech in þis deserte of galle
Thenk on þe womman Canane þat saide

And þouȝe þat I þe vnworþi sone of Eue
Be sinful ȝit accepte my bileue
And for þat feiþ is dede wiþout werkes
So for to worchen ȝeue me witte and space

O þou þat art so faire and so ful of grace
Be myne aduocate in so high a place
Ther as wiþout ende is songe Osanna

And of þi liȝt my soule in prison liȝt

Of my body and also by þe wiȝt
Of erþly lust and fals affection
O heuene o refute o saluacion
Of hem þat bene in sorowe and in distresse
Nowe helpe for to my werk I wil me dresse
  
Ȝit prey I ȝou þat reden þat I write
fforyeueþ me þat I doo no diligence  
þis ilk storie subtely to endite
ffor boþ haue I þe wordys and þe sentence
Of hem þat at seytes reuerence
þe storie wroot and folowen her legende
And prei ȝou þat ȝe wil my werk amende
First wolde I ȝou þe name of seint Cicile
Expoune as men in her stories see
It is to saye in engelisshe heuenes lilie
ffor pure chaastnesse of virginite
Oiþer for she witnesse had of honeste
Of grene of consciens and of good fame
The swote sauoure lilie was hure name
Oyþere Cicile is to say þe way to blynde
ffor she ensample was by good techinge
Or ellis Cicile as I writen fynde
Is ioyned by a manere conioynynge
Of heuene and lya and hier in figurynge
þe heuene is sette for þouȝt of holynesse
And lya for hure lastinge bisynesse
Cicile maye eke be seide in þis manere
Wantyng of blyndenesse for hure grete liȝt
Of sapience and of her thewes clere
Oiþer ellis loo þis maidens name briȝt
Of heuene and leos commeþ for which by riȝt
Men myȝt þe heuene of puple hure calle
Ensample of good and wise werkes alle
  
For leos puple in englissh is to say
And riȝt as men may in þe heuen see
The sonne and mone and þe sterres euery way
Riȝt so  goostly in þis maiden fre
Seen þe feiþ of magnificence
And eke of helpe and of sapience
And sondry werkes briȝt of excellence
And riȝt as þise philisophres write
þat heuene is swift rounde and brennynge
Riȝt so was faire Cicile þo white  
fful swift and bisy euere in werkinge
And rounde and hool in good perseuerynge
And brenne euere in charite liȝt
Now haue I declared ȝou what she hiȝt
This maiden briȝt Cicile as hure lif saiþ
was commen of Romaynes and of noble kynde
And so forþe fostred vp in þe faiþ
Of criste and bare hys gospel in her mynde
She neuere sesed as I writen fynde
Of hure preiere and god to loue and drede
Bisechinge hym to kepe her maidenhede
And whan þis maiden shuld vnto a man
ywedded be þat was ful ȝenge of age
That ycleped was valirian
And þe day was commen of hure mariage
She fille deuoute and humble in her corage
Vndere hure Robe of gold þat sat ful faire
And next hure flessh yclad was in an haire
  
And while þe Orgels maden melodie
To god allone þus in hert songe she
O lorde my saule and eke my body gie
Vnwemmed lest þat I confounded be
And for his loue þat dyed on a tree
Euery secounde or  day she fast
Ay bidynge in here orisons ful fast
The nyght come and to bed she most goon
Wiþ hure husbonde as aften is þe manere
And priuely she seide anōn
O swete and welbiloued spouse dere
þer is a counsaile and ȝe wold it here
Which þat riȝt fayn I wolde vnto ȝou seien
So þat ȝe me assured it nouȝt bywreien
Valeryan gan fast vnto hure swere
þat for no caas ne þinge þat myȝt be
He shold for no þinge neuere bewrien here  
And þan at arst þus to hym seide she
I haue an aungell which þat loueþ me
þat wiþ grete loue whedere I wake or slepe
Is redy ay my body forto kepe
And ȝif þat ȝe may felen out of drede
þat ȝe wil ȝou gouerne no þinge amys
He wil ȝou saue and kepe to ȝe be dede
ffor ȝoure clene lyuyng and ȝoure goodnesse
And bring ȝou streiȝte into heuene blesse
He wol ȝou loue as me for ȝoure clennesse
And schewen ȝou of his Ioye and his briȝtnesse
  
Valerian corrected as god wolde
Answerde aȝein if I shal trust to þe
lat me þat aungel se and hym biholde
And ȝif þat it a verrei aungel be
Þan wil I done as þou hast preide me
 And ȝif þou loue anoþer man þan me
riȝt wiþ þis swerde I wil slee ȝou boþe
Cicile Answerde anone in þis wise
And if ȝou lust þat aungel shul ȝe see
So þat ȝe trowe on criste and ȝou baptise
Goþ forþ to Via Apia quod she
þat from þis toune ne stant but myles þre
And to þe pore folk þat þere dwelle
Say hem riȝt þus as þat I shal ȝou telle
Say þat I Cicilie ȝou to hem sent
To shewe ȝou þe good vrban þe olde
ffor secre nedes and for good entent
And whan þat ȝe seint Vrban han byholde
Telle him þe wordes which I to ȝou tolde
And whan þat he haþ purged ȝou fro synne
þan shul ȝe seen þat aungel er ȝe twynne
Valerian is to þat place ygōn
And riȝt as hym was tauȝt by his lurnynge
He fonde þis holy Vrban anon
Amonge þise seintes buriels lowtynge  
And he anon wiþout tariynge
Did his massage and whan he had  tolde
Vrban for ioye gan his hondes vp holde
  
The teeres from his eien lete he falle
Almyȝty god o Ihesu crist quod he
Sowere of chaast counsaile and herde of vs alle
The fruyte of þilke seede of chaastite
þat þou haste sawe in cicile take to þee
Loo like a bisy bee wiþout gile
þe serueth ay þine owne thralle Cicile
For þilk spouse þat she toke but nowe
fful like a ferce leon she sendeþ here
As meke as eny lombe was to ȝou·
And wiþ þat worde anon þer gan apere
An olde man clad wiþ white cloþes clere
And had a boke wiþ lettres of golde in honde
And gan biforne Valerian stonde
Valerian as dede fille doune for drede
whan he hym segh and hym vphent þoo
And on his boke þus he gan to rede
Oo lord oo feiþ oo god wiþoute moo
Of cristendome and fadere of all also
Abouen alle and oueral euery where
þise wordes al wiþ gold writen were
Whan þis was radde þat seide þis olde man
Leuest þou þis þing or no sai ȝe or nay
I leue al þis þin  
ffor sother thyng  
Vndere þe heuene no wiȝt ne þenk may
 Tho vanshed þat olde man he nyst wher
And pope Vrban hym cristened riȝt þere
  
Valerian goþ home to seint Cicile
And withInne his chambre an Aungel he segh stande
Þis aungel had of rose and of lilie
Corownes two þe whiche he bare on hande
And first to Cicile as I vnderstande
Be ȝaf þat oon and aftere gan he take  
Þat oþer to Valerian her make
Wiþ body clene and wiþ vnwemmed þouȝt
kepeþ ay wel þise corownes quod he
ffrom paradise to ȝou haue I hem brouȝt
Ne neuere more shul þei roten be
Ne lese her swete sauoure tresteth me
Ne neuere wiȝt shal seene hem wiþ his ye
But he be chaast and hate vilenye
And þou valerian for þou so sone
Assentest to good counsaile also
ffay what þe lust and þou shalt haue þi bone
I haue a broþer quod Valerian þoo
þat in þis world I loue no man soo 
I prey ȝou þat my broþere may haue grace
To knowe þe trouþe as I do in þis place
The aungel answerde god likeþ ȝour request
And boþ wiþ þe palme of marterdome
ȝe shul come vnto þe blisful fest
And wiþ þat worde tiburce his broþere come
And whan þat he þe sauoure vndernome
Wiþ þat þe roses and þe lilies caste
WiþInne his herte he gan to wonder faste
  
And saide in þis tyme I wondere of þe ȝere
whennys þis swete sauoure commeþ soo 
And roses and lilies þat I smelle here
ffor þouȝe I had hem in myn hondes twoo
þe sauoure myȝt in me no depper goo

Haþ chaunged me al in a noþer kinde
Valerian saide two corownes haue we
Snowe white and rose rede þat shyneþ clere
which þat þine eyen han no myȝt to see
And as þowe smellest hem þourȝe þi preiere
So Shalt þou sene hem leue broþer dere
ȝif it so be þou wilt wiþoute sclouþe
Byleue a riȝt and knowe þe verrey trouþe  
Tyburce answerd seist þou þis to me
In soþnesse or in dreeme herken ȝe þis
In dremes quod Valerian han we be
Into þis tyme broþer myn ywis
But nowe at arst our trouþe dwelling is
Howe woost þou quod Tiburce and in what wise
Quod Valerian þat shal I þe devise
The Aungel of god haþ me þe trouþe tauȝt
Which þat þou shalt seen if þat þow wilt reneye
The ydoles and be clene and ellis nauȝt
But of þe myracles of þise corownes tweye
Seint Ambrose in his preface list to seie
Solempnely this noble doctour dere
Commendeþ it and seiþ in þis manere
  
The palme of marterdome forto receyue
Seint Cicile fulfilled of goddys ȝift
þe worlde and ke hure chambre gan she weyue
Witnesse Tiburce and Cicilees shrift
To which god of his bountee wolde shift
Corownes two of flowres wel smellynge
And made þe aungel hem þoo corownes bringe
This made haþ brouȝt þise men to blisse aboue
þe world haþ wist what it is worþ certeyne
Deuocion of chastite to loue
Tho shewed hym Cicile open and pleyne
That alle ydoles nys but þing in veyne
ffor þei bene dombe and þerto þei bene defe
And charged hym his ydols forto lef
Who þat þis troueþ nat a beest he is
Quod þoo tyburce if þat I shal not ly
She gan þan kisse his brest and pat herd þis
And was ful glad he couþe trouþ aspie
This daye take I þe for myne alye
Saide þis blesful maide faire and dere
ffor aftere þat she saide as ȝe may here 
Loo ryȝt so as þe loue of crist quod She  
Made me þi broþeres wif riȝt in þat wise
Anoon for myn alie here take I þe
Siþens þat þou wolt þine ydoles despise
Go wiþ þi broþer nowe and þe baptise
And make þe clene so þat þou maist beholde
þe Aungels face of which þi brother tolde
  
Tyburse answerd and seide broþer dere
ffurst telle me whidere I shal and to what man
To whome quod he come forþ wiþ riȝt goode chere
I wil þe lede vnto þe pope Vrban
To Vrban broþer myne Valerian
Quod þoo Tiburce wilt þou me þidere lede
Me þenkeþ þat it were a wondere dede
Remenest þou nat Vrban quod he þoo
That is so ofte dampned to be dede
And wonneþ in halkes to and froo
And dar nat onys put forþ his hede
Men shul hym brenne in a fire so rede
If he were founde þat men myȝt hym spie
And we also þat bere hym companye
And whiles we seken þilk Dyuinyte
þat is ihidde in heuene prive
Algate ybrent in þis world shul we be
To whom Cicile answerd bodily
Men myȝt drede wel and skilfully
This lif to lese myn owne dere broþer
ȝif þis were lyuynge only and non oþer
But þer is better lif in ooþer place
That neuere shal be lost drede þe nouȝt
Which goddes sone vs tolde þourgh his grace

And al that wrought is with a skilful thoght
The gost that fro the fader gan procede
hath sowled hem withouten ony drede
  
By word and by myracle he goddes sone
whan he was in this world declared here
That ther was other lif ther men may wone
Tho answerde Tiburce o suster dere
Ne seidestow right now in this manere
Ther nys but o god lord in sothfastnesse
And now of three how maisthow bere witnesse
That shal y telle quod she or y go
Riȝt as a man haþ sapiences þre
Memorie engeyne and intellecte also
So in oo beinge of diuinite
Thre persones riȝt wel þer may be
Tho gan she hym bisily preche
Of cristes come and of his peynes teche  
And mony poyntes of his passion
How goddys sonne in þis wiþholde
To do mankynde pleyn remyssion
That was ybounde in cares colde
Al þis þinge she vnto Tiburce tolde
And aftere þis Tiburce in good entent
To pope Vrban wiþ Valerian went
Which þonked god and wiþ glad hert and liȝt
He Cristned hym and made hym in þat place
Parfit in his lyuynge goddys knyȝt
And after þis Tiburce gate such grace
þat euery day he seie in tyme and space
þe Aungel of god and euery maner bone
þat he god asked it was spedde ful sone
  
It were ful harde by order forto seyne
Howe mony wonders Ihesu for hym wrouȝt
But atte last to telle short and pleyn
The sergeaunt of þe towne of Rome hem souȝt
And hem byforn Almache þe prouost brouȝt
Whiche hem opposed and knewe al her entent
And to þe ymage of Iubiter he hem sent
And saide who so wil not sacrifise
Swap of his heued þis is my sentence here
Anone þise marteers þat I ȝou deuise
On maximius þat was an officere
Of þe prefectis and of Corniculere
Hem hent and whan he forþe þe seyntes ladde
Hym self he wepte for pite þat he hadde
Whan maximius had herde þe seintes lore
he gate hem of þe turmentours leue
And had hem in his hous wiþout more
And wiþ her prechinge er þat it were eue
þei gone from þe tormentours to reue
And fro maximius and fro his folk echone
þe fals feith to trowe in god allone
Cicile come whan it was woxen nyȝt  
Wiþ preestes þat hem cristened al in fere
And afterward whan day was waxen liȝt
Cicile hem seide wiþ a sobre chere
Now cristes owne knyȝtes leef and dere
Casteþ al away þe werkes of derknesse
And armeþ ȝou in armure of liȝtnesse
  
Ȝe han forsoþe ydone grete bataille
Which is nowe done ȝoure feiþ han ȝe confermed
Goþ to þe corowne of lif þat may not faile
The Riȝt Iuge which þat ȝe han disserued
Tofore hym ȝe bene feiþfulli preserued
And whan þis þinge was seide as I deuise
Men ladde hem forþe to done þe sacrifise
But whan þei were vnto þe place brouȝt
To telle shortely þe conclusioun
Þei nolde ensence ne sacrifise riȝt nouȝt
But on her knees þei setten hem adoun
Wiþ humble hert and sad deuocioun
And losten boþ her hedes in þe place
Her saules wenten to þe kinge of grace
This Maximius þat see þis þinge betide
wiþ pitous tales tolde it anon riȝt
That he her sawles seghe to heuene glide
Wiþ aungels ful of cleernesse and of liȝt
And wiþ his worde conuerted mony a wiȝt
ffor which Almachius did hym so to bete
Wiþ whippe of lede til he his lif gan lete
Cicile hym toke and buried hym anōn
By Tiburce and Valerian softely
WiþInne her heriyng place vnder þe ston
And aftere þis Almachius hastely
Bad his mynystres fecchen opynly
Cicile so she myȝt in his presence
Don sacrifise and Iubiter ensence
  
But þei conuerted þorgh her wise lore
Wepten sore and ȝaf credence  
Vnto her worde and criden more and more
Crist goddes sone wiþoute difference
Is Verrey god þis is all oure sentence
þat haþ so good a seruaunte hym to serue
Thus wiþ oo vois we trowe þouȝe we sterue
Almachius þat herde al this 
Bad foche Cicile þat he myȝt hure se
And alderfurst loo þis was his askinge
What maner womman art þou þo quod he

Of þi religion and of þi bileue
Whi þan bygan ȝoure question folily
Quod she þat woldest two answers conclude
In oon demannde ȝe asked lewedely

Of whennys 
Of whennys  
Of conscience and of good feiþ vnfeyned
Almachius seide takest þou non hede
Of þine answere and she hym answerd þus
Ȝoure myȝt quod she litel is to drede
ffor euery mortell mannys power nys
But lich a bladdere ful of wynde ywis
ffor wiþ a nedelys poynte whan þat is blowe
May al þe boost of it be laide ful lowe
  
Ful wronfully bygonne þou quod he
And ȝit in wronge is þi perseueraunce
Woost þou nat how oure myȝty princes fre
Ben þus comaunded and maken ordinaunce
þat euery cristen wiȝt shal han penaunce
But ȝif þat he his cristendome wiþseyn
And goon al quite if he wil it receyne
Ȝoure princes aren as ȝoure noblen doþ
Quod þoo Cicile and a woode sentence
Ȝe make vs gilty and it nys nat soth
ffor ȝe þat knowen wel our Innocence  
ffor as moch as we done Reuerence
To criste and for we bere a cristen name
Ȝe put on vs a cryme and eke a blame
But we þat knowen þilk name soo
ffor vertuous we may it not say
Almachy answerde chese on of þise twoo
Do sacrifise or cristendome reney
Þat þowe may nowe scapen by þat way
At which þe holy blisful maide
Gan forto lauȝe and to þe Iuge she saide
O Iuge confuse in þi nycete
Wilt þou þat I reneye Innocence
To maken me a wicked wiȝt quod she
loo he dissimuleþ here in audience
He stareþ and wodeþ in his aduertence
To whom Almachius o vnsely wrecch
Ne woost þow not howe ferre my myȝt may strecch
  
Haþ nouȝt our myȝty prince to me yȝouen
Ȝe boþ powere and auctoritee
To make folk to dien or to lyuen
Whi spekest þou so proudly þan to me
I ne speke but stedfastly quod she
Nouȝt proudely for I saie as for my side
I hate dedly þilke vice of pride
And ȝif þou drede nouȝt a soþe to here
þan wil I shewen al openly by riȝt
þat þou hast made a ful grete lesinge here
Thow seist þi princes han ȝeue þe myȝt
Boþ to sleene and forto quyk a wiȝt
Thowe þat ne maist but only lif here byreue
Thow nast þerto neiþere power ne leue

Mynyster of deþ for ȝif þou speke of moo
þow liest for þi power is ful naked
Do way þi boldnesse saide Almachius þoo
And sacrifise to our goddys twoo
I ne recche nouȝt what wronge þat þou me profre  
ffor I can suffre it as a philosofre
But þilk wronges may I nat endure
þat þou spekest of oure goddes here quod he
Cicele answerde oo nyce creature
þow seidest no word siþ þou spekest to me
þat I ne knewe þerwiþ þi nycete
And þat þowe were in euery maner wise
A lewde officere and a veyn Iustise
  
Ther lackeþ no þinge to þine vtter eyen
þat þou nart blynde for þing þat we seen alle
þat is a stone þat men may wel aspien
That ilke stoon a god þou wolt it calle
I rede þe lat þine h vppon it falle
And taast it wel and stoon þou shalt it fynde
Siþe þat þou seest it nat wiþ þine eyen blynde
It is a shame þat þe puple shal
So scorne þe and lauȝe at þi foly
ffor comonly wommen wote it well ouerall
That myȝty god is in heuene hie
And þise ymages wel þan maist þou spie
To þe ne to hem self may þei nat profite
And in her effecte þei bene nat worth a myte
Thise and such oþer wordes saide She
And he wexe wrooþ and bad she shuld be lede
home to her hous and in her hous quod he
Brenne hure in a fuyre wiþ flawmes rede
And as he bad ryȝt so was done þe dede
And in a bath þei gan hure fast shetten
And nyght and day grete fuyre vnder þei maden
Al þe longe nyȝt and eke þe day also
ffor al þe fuyre and eke þe baþes hete
She satte al colde and felt of it no woo
Ne made hure a drope nouȝt forto swete
But in þat bath her lif She most lete
ffor he Almachie wiþ ful wicked entent
To scleen hure in þe bath his sonde sent     
Thre strokes in þe nekke he smote hure þoo
The turmentour but for no manere chaunce
He myȝt not smyten al her necke a two
And for þer was þat tyme an ordynaunce
That none shuld to no man do such penaunce
þe ferþe stroke to smyten soft or sore
This turmentour ne durst do no more
But half dede wiþ her necke ycoruen þere
He laft hure lye and on his waye he went
þe Cristen folk which aboute hure were
Wiþ shetes home ful faire hure hente
Thre daies lyued she in þis torment
And neuere cesed hem þe feiþ to teche
Whom she had fostred hem she gan to preche
And hem she ȝaf her meueables and her þinge
And to þe pope Vrban bytoke hem þoo
And saide þus I asked þis of heuene kynge
To han respite þre daies and no moo
To recomaunde to ȝou er þat I goo
Thise soules loo and þat I myȝt to wirche
Here of myn hous perpetuelly a chirche
SEynt Vrban wiþ his dekenes priuely
The body fette and buried it by nyȝt
Amonge his oþer seintes honestly
Hure hous þe churche of seint Cicile hiȝt
Seint Vrban halawed it as he wel myȝt
In þe which into þis daye in noble wise
Men done to crist and to his seinte servise
Whan ended was þe lif of seinte Cecile
Er we fully had ryden five myle
An boghton vnder þe ble vs gan a take
A man þat cloþed was in cloþes blake
And vnder þat he had a white surplis
His hakeney þat was so pomel gris  
So swete þat it wondere was to see
It semed he had prikked myles þre
þe hors eke þat his ȝeman rode vpon
So swette þat vnneþes myȝt he gon
Aboute þe peitrell stood þe foom ful hie
He was of fome al flekked as a pie
A male twifolde on his cropour laye
It semed þat he caried litel araye
Al liȝt for somer roode þis worþi man 
And in myn herte wondre I bygan
What þat he was til I vnderstode
How þat his cloke was sewed to his hode
ffor which whan I longe had avised me
I demed hym some chanon forto be
His hatte honge at his bak doune by a laas
ffor he had ryden more þan trotte or paas
He had aye prikked like as he were wood
A clote leef he had vnder his hode
ffor swote and forto kepe his hede from hete
But it was ioye forto seen hym swete
His forhede dropped as a Stillatorie
Were ful of planteyne and of Pyritorie
  
And whan þat he came he gan to crie
God saue quod he þis Ioly companye
ffast haue I prikked quod he for ȝoure sake
Because þat I wolde ȝou ouertake
To ryden in þis mery company
His ȝeman eke was ful of curtesie
And sirres now in þe morowe tide
Out of ȝoure ostelrie I segh ȝou ride
And warned here my lorde and my souereyn
Which þat to ride wiþ ȝou is ful fayn
ffor his disporte he loueþ daliaunce
ffrende for þi warnyng god ȝeue þe good chaunce
Seide oure hoste certes it wolde seme
Thi lorde were wise and so I may wel deme  
He is ful iocounde also dar I lay
Can he ouȝt telle a mery tale or twaye
Wiþ which he glade may þis company
Who sir my lord ȝe ȝe wiþouten lie
He can of merth and eke of Iolite
And þat ynouȝe also sir tresteth me
And ȝe hym knewe as wel as do I
ȝe wolde wonder howe wel and thriftelie
He couþe worche and þat in sondry wise
He haþ take on hym mony sondry aprise
Which were ful hard for eny þat is here
To bringe aboute but þei of hym it lere
As homely as he ritte amonge ȝou
If ȝe hym knewe it wolde be ȝour prowe
Ȝe nolde nat forgon his aqueyntaunce
ffor mochel good I dar laie in balaunce
All þat I haue in myn possession
He is a man of hiȝe discrecion
I warne ȝowe wel he is a passing man
Wel koþe our hoost I prey þe telle me þan
Is he Clerk or noon telle what he is
Nay he is gretter þan a clerk ywis
  
Seide þe ȝeman and in woordes fewe
Oost of his craft somwhat I wil ȝou shewe
I saie my lorde can such a sotilte
But all his craft ȝe may not wit at me
And Somwhat helpe I ȝit to his worchinge
þat al þis grounde which þat we ben on ridynge
Til þat we come to caunterberye toun
He coude al clere turne vp so doun
And paue it al of siluer and of golde
And whan þis ȝeman had þus ytolde
Vnto oure hooste he seide Benedicite
This þing is wonder mervelous to me
Siþens þat þi lord is of so hiȝe prudence
Bycause of which men shulde hym reuerence  
Þat of his worship rekkeþ he so lite
His ouersclope nys nat worþ a myte
As in effecte to him as mot I goo
It is al baudy and totore also
Whi is þi lord so scluttish I þe prey
And is of power better cloþes to beye
If þat his dede accorde wiþ þi speche
Telle me þat I þe biseche
Whi quod þis ȝeman wherto aske ȝe me
God helpe me so for he shal neuere the
But I wil nat avowe þat I say
And þerfore kepe it secre I ȝou pray
He is to wise in feiþ as I bileue
That þat is ouerdone it nyl not preue
And riȝt as clerkes seyn it is a vice
wherfore in þat I holde hym lewde and nyce
ffor whan a man haþ ouer grete a witte
fful often it happeþ to misusen it
So doþ my lord and þat me greueþ sore
God it amende I can seye now no more
Therof no fors good ȝeman quod our hoost
Syþ of þe konyng of þi lord þou wost
  
Telle howe he doþ I prey þe hertely
Siþþes þat he is so crafty and so scly
Where dwellen ȝe if it to telle be
In þe Subarbes of a toune quod he
Lurkynge in hernes and in lanes blynde
Where þise Robbers and þeues be kynde
Holden her pirve feerful residence
As þei þat dar not shewen her presence
So fare we if I shal say þe soþe
ȝit quod  oste lat me talke to the
Why art þou discolowred on þi face
Peter quod he god ȝeue it harde grace
I am so vsed þe fire to blowe
That it haþ chaunged my colour as I trowe  
I ne am not wonte in no myrour to prie
But swynke sore and lerne to multiplie
We Blundren euere and powren in þe fire
And for alle þat we faillen of our desire
ffor euere we lacken our conclusion
To moche folk we bene but illusion
And borowe golde be it a pound or twoo
Or ten or twelue or mony sommes moo
And make hem wenen at the leest wey
þat of a pounde we cowde make twey
Ȝit is it fals and ay we han good hope
It forto doon and aftere it we grope
But þat science is so fer vs biforne
We mowe not alle þouȝe we had it sworne
It ouertake it slitt away so fast
It wil vs make beggers at þe last
þe whiles þis ȝeman was þus in his talkyng
This Chanon drowe hym nere and herd al þinge
Which þat þis ȝem spake for suspecion
 Of mennys speche euere had þis chanon
ffor Caton seiþ he þat gilty is
Demeþ al þinge be spoke of hym ywis
  
By cause of þat he gan so nyȝe to drawe
His ȝeman þat herd alle his sawe
And þus he seide vnto his ȝeman þoo
Holde now þi pees and speke no wordes moo
ffor if þowe doo þu shalt it dere aby
þow sclaunderest me here in þis company
And eke diskeuerest þat þou shuldest hide
ȝe quod oure hoost telle on what so betide
Of al þis þretynge rech þe not a myte
In feiþ quod he no moore I doo but lite
And whan þis chanon segh it wold nat be
But þat his ȝeman wolde telle his priuete
He fledde away for verrey sorowe and shame
A quod the ȝeman here shal arise a game  
All þat I can anon wil I telle
Siþens he is goon þe foule fende hym quelle
ffor neuere here after wil I wiþ hym mete
ffor peny ne for pounde I ȝou bihete
He þat me brouȝt furst vnto þat game
Er þat he dye sorowe haue he and shame
ffor it it is ernest to me by my feiþe
þat fele I wele what so eny man seiþe
and ȝit for all my smerte and al my greff
ffor al my sorowe labour and meschieff
I kouþe neuere leue it in no wise
Now wold god my wittes myȝt suffise
To tellen al þat longen to þat art
But naþeles ȝit wil I telle ȝowe part
Siþens þat my lorde is goon I wil not spare
Such þinge as I knowe I wil declare
With þis chanon  dwelt haue seuene ȝere
And of his science am I neuer þe nere
Al þat I had I haue ylost þerby
And god woo so han many moo þan I
Ther I was wonte to be riȝt fressh and gay
Of cloþinge and of good aray
Now may I were an hose vpon myne heued
And where my coloure was boþ fresh and rede
Now is it wan and of a lewde hwe
Who so it vseþ sore shal he rwe
And of my swynk ȝit blered is myn ye
Loo suche auauntage it is to multiplie
That sclydinge science haþ me made so bale
That I haue no good wher so euer y fare
And ȝit am I endetted so þerby
Of golde þat I haue borowed trewly
That whil I lyve I shal it quite neuere
Lat euery man be ware by me for euere
What maner man þat casteþ hym þerto  
If he contynue I holde his thrift ydo
ffor so helpe me god þerby shal he nat wynne
But empty his purs and make his wyttes þinne
And whan he thorgh his madnesse and folye
Haþ lost his owne good þorgh Iopardye
þan he exciteþ oþer men þerto
To lese her good as hym self haþ doo 
ffor to shrewes Ioies it is an ese
To haue her felawes in peyn and dissese
  
Thus was I ones lerned of a clerk
Of þat no charge I wil speke of our werk
Whan we bene þere as we shul exercise
Oure eluessh craft we seme wonder wise
Our teermes bene so clergial and so queynte
I blowe þe fyre til þat myn hert feynte
What shuld I telle eche proporcion
Of þingges which þat we worchen vpon
As on v or vj vnces may wel be
Of Siluere or of som oþer quantite
And bisy me to telle ȝou þe names
Of Orpyment brent bonys yren squames
Thatt into powdere grounden bene ful small
And in an erthen pot howe þat pitte is alle
And salt ypitte In and also paupere
Byfore þise powdres þat I speke of here
And wel ykeuered wiþ a laumpe of glas
And of moche oþer þinge what þer was
And of the potte and glas englutynge
That of þe eyre myȝt passe no þinge
And of þe Esy fire and smert also
Which þat was made and of the care and woo
That we had in our maters sublymynge
And in amalgamynge and calcenynge
Of quik siluere ycleped Mercurie crude
ffor all oure scleightes we can not conclude
Our orpyment and sublymed Mercurye  
Our grounde litarge eke on þe porphirie
Of eche of þise of vnces a certeyn
Nat helpeþ vs oure labour is in veyn
Ne eke oure spirites assencioun
Ne eke our maters þat lyen al fixe adoun
Mowen in oure worchinge no þing vs availe
ffor lost is al our laboure and travaile
And all þe cost on twenty deuel weye
Is lost also whiche we vpon it laye
  
Ther is also mony a nother þing
That is to our craft appertenynge
þouȝe I by ordere hem here ne reherce kan
Because þat I am a lewde man
ȝit wil I telle hem as þei come to mynde
þouȝe I ne can sette hem in her kynde
As boole armonyak verdegrees boras
And sondry vessels made of erþe and glas
Our vrynales and our dyscensories

And oþer suche dere ynowe a leke
Nat nedeþ it to rehersen hem alle
Waters rubyfyinge and bolles galle

And herbes coude I telle eke mony on

And oþer such ȝif þat me list tarie

To bringe about our craft ȝif þat we may

Sered pockettes sal peter and vitriole
And dyuers fires made of wode and Cole

And combust maters and coagulate

Of Tartere alem glas berme wort and argoille
Rysalgere and oþere mateers enbykinge
And eke of oure mateers encorporinge
And of  Siluer citrinacion
Our sementynge and fermentacion
Our ingotes testes and mony moo 
I wil ȝou telle as was me tauȝt also

By ordre oft as I herd my lord hem neuene
The first spirit quyksiluere cleped is

Sal Armonyak and þe ferþ bremstone

And Venus Coper be my fadere kynne
This cursed craft who so wil exercise
He shal no good han þat may hym suffise
ffor al þe good he spendeþ þeraboute
He lese shal þerof haue I no doute
Who so þat list to outen his foly
Lat hym come forþ and lerne forto multiplie
And euery man þat haþ ouȝt in his cofre
Lat  apere and wexe a philosofre
Ascaunce þat craft is so liȝt to lere
Nay nay god wote al be he monke or frere
Preest chanon or eny oþer wiȝt

In lernyng of þis elvissh nyce lore

Al coude he lettrure or coude he none  
As in effecte he shal fynde it all one

But ȝit for þat I to moche rehersaille
Of waters corosif and of lymaille
And of bodyes mollificacion
And also of her induracion
  
Oilles abluciōn and metal fusible
To tellen alle wold passen eny bible

Of all þise names now wil I me rest
ffor as I trawe I haue ȝou tolde ynowe
To reisen a feende loke he neuere so rowe
A nay lat be þi philosophres stone
Elixir cleped we sechen fast echone
ffor had we hym þan were we siker ynouȝe
But vnto god of heuene I make avowe
ffor al our craft whan we han al ydoo
And al oure scleiȝte he wil not come vs too
He haþ vs made spende moche good
ffor sorowe of which almost we wexen wode
But þat good hope crepeþ in our hert
Supposinge euere þouȝe we sore smert
To be releued by hym afterward
Supposinge þat hope is sharpe and hard
I warne ȝou wele it is to seken euere

In trest þerof from alle þat euere þei hadde
Ȝit of þat art þei koude not wexen sadde
ffor vnto hem it is a bitterswete
So semeþ it for ne had þei but a shete
Which þei myȝt wrap hem in a nyȝt
And a bak to walken In by day liȝt
They wold hem Sellen and spenden on þis craft  
They can not stynt til no þinge be laft
And euermore wher þat euere þei gone
Men may hem knowe by þe smelle of bremstone
ffor al þe worlde þei stynken as a gote
Her sauour is so rammyssh and so hote
þat þouȝ a man fro hem a myle be
þe Sauour wil enfecte hym tresteþ me
Lo Thus by smellyng and be threde bare aray
Ȝif þat men lust þise folk þei know may
  
And if a man wil aske hym prively
Whi þei bene cloþed so vnthriftily
Riȝt anone þei wil rownen in his eere
And seie if þey aspied were
Men wolde hem slee by cause of her science
Loo þus þise folk bitraien Innocence
Passe ouer þis I go my tale vnto
Er þan þe potte be on þe fuyre ydoo
Of metalles wiþ a certeyn quantite
My lorde hem tempreþ and no man but he
Now he is goon I dar saie boldely
ffor as men seyne he can do craftely
Algate I wote wel he haþ such a name
And ȝit ful ofte he renneþ in þe blame
And wete ȝe how ful ofte it happeth soo 
The potte tobrekeþ and farewel al is goo
Thise metalles bene of so grete violence
Our walles may not maken hem resistence
But ȝif þei  wrouȝt of lyme and stone
þei percen so þat þorȝe þe wall þei gone
And somme of hym synken into þe grounde
Thus haue we lost by tymes mony a pound
And somme are scatered al the flore aboute
Somme lepen into þe Roof without doute
Thouȝe þat þe feende nat in our siȝt hym shewe
 I trowe þat he wiþ vs be þat schrewe
In helle wher þat he is lord and sire  
Ne is þer no more woo angere ne Ire
Whan þat oure pot is broke as I haue saide
Euery man chitte and halt hym euel paide
Som saide it was longe on þe fire makinge
Som saide nay it was on þe blowynge
Than was I aferde for þat was myn office
Strawe quod þe þred ȝe bene lewde and nyce
It was nat tempred as it auȝt be
Nay quod þe ferþe stynt and harken me
  
Be cause oure fire was not made of beche
þat is þe cause noon oþere so theche
I can not telle wheron it is alonge
But wel I woot gret strif is vs amonge
What quod my lorde þer nys no more to done
Of þise periles I wil be ware eft sone
I am riȝt syker þat þe pot was craised
Be as be may be ȝe no þinge amased
As vsage is lat swepe þe flore as swithe
Pluk vp ȝoure hert and be ȝe glad and blithe
þe Mullok on an hepe yswoped was
And on þe floore cast a canvas
And al this Mullok in a sif ythowe
And ysifted and yplukked many a throwe
Parde quod oon somwhat of oure metall
Ȝit is þer here þouȝe we haue nat all
And þouȝe þis þinge myshapped haþ as nowe
Anoþer tyme It may be wel ynowe
Vs most putt our good in auenture
A Marchaunte parde may not ay endure
Tresteþ me wel in his prosperite
Somtyme his good is drowned in þe see
And somtyme commeth it sauf vnto þe londe
Pees quod my lord þe next tyme I wil fonde
To brynge our craft al in anoþer plite
And but I doo sirs lat me haue þe wite
Ther was defaute in somwhat wel I wote  
And oþer seide þe fire was ouere hote
But be it hote or cold I dar saie þis
þat we concluden euer more amys
We faillen of that which þat we wold haue
And in oure madnesse euermore we raue
And whan we bene togidere euerechon
Euery man semeþ as wise as Salomon
But al þinge which þat seineþ as þe golde
Is nat golde as I haue herd it tolde
  
Ne euery appel þat is faire at ye
Ne is not god what so men clappe or crie
Riȝt so loo fareþ it amonges vs 
He þat semeþ þe wisest by Ihesus
Is moost foole whan it commeþ to þe preef
And he þat semeþ trewest is a þeef
That shul ȝe knowe er þat I from ȝou wende
Be þat I of my tale haue made an ende
Ther is a chanon of Religioun
Amonges vs wolde enfecte al a toun
Thouȝe it as grete were as was Nyniue
Rome Alisaundre  Troie and oþer þre
his scleightes and his infinite falsnesse
Ther couþe no man writen as I gesse
Thouȝe þat he myȝt lyuen a thousand ȝere
In al þis world of falsenesse nys his pere
ffor in his teermes he wil hym so wynde
And speke his wordes in so scleȝe a kynde
Whan he comune shal wiþ eny wiȝt
That he wil make hym dote anon riȝt
But it þe feende be as hym seluen is
fful mony a man haþ he bygyled er þis
And wil if þat he may lif a while
And ȝit men riden and goon ful mony a myle
Hym forto seke and haue of aqueyntaunce
Nat knowing of his fals gouernaunce
And ȝif ȝe lust to ȝeue me audience  
I wil it tellen in wiþ ȝoure presence
But worshipful Chanon Religious
Ne demeþ not I sclaundere ȝour hous
Alþouȝe my tale of a chanon be
Of euery ordere som shrewe is parde
And god forbede þat all a companye
Shulde rewe a syngule mannys foly
To sclaundere ȝou is nat myn entent
But to correcten þat mys Iment
  
This tale was not only told for ȝou
But eke for oþer moo ȝe wote wel howe
That amonges cristes apostels twelue
þer ne was no traitour but Iudas selue
Than whi shulde þe remenaunte all haue blame
þat giltlees were be ȝou saye I þe same
Sauf only þis if ȝe wil harken me
If eny Iudas in ȝoure couent be
Remeueth hym be tyme I ȝou rede
If shame or losse may causen eny drede
And beþ no þinge displesed I ȝou pray
But in this caas herkneþ what I say
In london was a preest an annuelere
That þerInne dwelled had mony a ȝere
Which was so plesaunt and so seruisable
Vnto þe wiff where he was att table
That she wolde suffre hym no þing forto paye
ffor borde ne  cloþinge went he neuere so gay
And spending siluere had he riȝt ynowe
Therof no force I wil procede as nowe
And telle forþ my tale of þe chanon
þat brouȝt þis preest to confusion
This fals chanon came vpon a day
Vnto þe preestes chambere þer he lay
Bysechinge hym to lene hym a certeyn
Of golde and he wolde quyte hym ageyn
Leneþ me a marke quod he but daies þre  
And at my day I wil it quite þe
And it so be þow fynde me fals
An oþer day honge me by þe hals
This prest him toke a marke and þat as swithe
And þis chanon hym þonked ofte sithe
And toke his leue and went forþ his way
And at þe þred day brouȝt his monay
And to þis preest he toke his gold ageyn
Therof þis preest was glad and fayn
  
Certes quod he no þinge anoyeþ me
To lene a man a noble or twoo or þree
Or what þinge were in my possession
Whan he so trewe is of condicion
That in no wise he breke wil his day
To such a man I can neuere say nay
What quod þis chanon shuld I be vntrewe
 Nay þat were þinge fallen al of nwe
Treuþe is a þing þat I wil euer kepe
Vnto þe day in which þat I shal crepe
Into my graue and ellis god forbede
Bileueþ þis as siker as is ȝoure crede
God thonke I and in good tyme be it seide
That þer was neuere man ȝit euel apaide
ffor gold ne siluere þat he to me lent
Ne neuere falshede to myne hert I ment
And sire quod he nowe in my privete
Siþens ȝe so goodly haue bene to me
And kyþed to me so grete gentilnesse
Somwhat to quiten wiþ ȝour kyndenesse
I wil ȝou shewe and ȝif ȝou lust to lere
I shal it shewe to ȝou anon riȝt here
How I can worchen in philosophie
Takeþ good hede ȝe shullen see wel at ye
That I wil done a maistrie er I goo
Ȝe quod þe preest ȝe sir and wil ȝe so
Marie þerof I prei ȝou hertely  
At ȝoure comaundement sir trewly
Quod þe chanon and ellis god forbede
Loo howe þis þeef kouþe his seruise bede
fful soþ it is þat such propferd seruise
Stynkeþ as witnessen þise olde wise
And þat ful sone I wil it verefie
In þis chanōn is rote of al trecherye
That euere more delite haþ and gladnesse
Such feendly þouȝtes in his hert empresse
  
How cristes puple he may to meschief bringe 
God kepe vs from his fals dissimulynge
What wist þis preest wiþ whom þat he delte
Ne of his harme commyng no þing he felte
O sely preest o sely Innocent
Wiþ couetise anon þou shalt be blent
O gracelees ful blynde is þi conseite
No þing art þow war of þe deceite
Which þat þis fox shapen haþ to þe
His wily wrenches þou maist not flee
Wherfore to goo to þe conclusion

Vnhappy man anon I wil me hye
To tellen þine vnwitte and þi foly
And eke þe falsenesse of þat oþer wrecche
As ferforþ as my conyng wil strecche
þis chanon was my lorde ȝe wolde wene
Sir Oost in feiþ and by þe Heuene quene
It was anoþer chanon and nat he

Of his falsnesse it dulleþ me to ryme
Euere whan I speke of his falshede
ffor shame of him my chekes wexen rede
Algates þei bygonne forto glowe
ffor redenesse haue I now riȝt wel I knowe
In my visage for fumes dyuers  
Of metalles which ȝe han herde me rehers
Consumed and waasted han my Redenesse 
Take nowe hede of þi chanons cursednesse
Sir quod he to þe preest lat ȝour man gone
ffor quyk siluere þat we it had anōn
And lat hym brynge vnces twoo or þre
And whan he commeþ as fast shul ȝe se
A wonder þinge whiche ȝe see neuere er þis
Sir quod þe preest it shal be done ywis
  
He bad his seruaunte fecchen him þis þinge
And he al redy was at his biddynge
And went hym forþ and come anon ageyn
wiþ þis quyk siluere shortely forto seyn
And toke þise vnces þre to þe chanoun
And he it laide faire and wel adoun
And bad þe seruaunte colys forto brynge
Þat he anoon myȝt goo to his worchis
The Colis riȝt anoon weren sette
And þis Chanon toke out a croslette
Of his bosom and shewed it þe preest
This instrument quod he which þat þou seest
Take in þine hond and pitt þiself þerInne
Of þis quyk siluer an vnce an here bygynne
In þe name of crist to wex a philosophre
Þer bene ful fewe whiche þat I wold profre
To shewen hem þus mochel of my science
ffor ȝe shullen see here by experience
That þis quik siluer I wil mortefie
Riȝt in ȝoure siȝt anoon wiþout lye
And made it as good siluer and as fyne
As þer is eny in ȝoure purs er myne
Or ellis where and make it malliable
And ellis holde me fals and vnable
Amonges folke euer to apere
I haue a powder here þat cost me dere
Shal make al good for it is cause of all  
My konynge which þat I ȝou shewe shall
Voideþ ȝour man and lat hym be þer out
And schitte þe door þe whiles we bene aboute
Our privete þat no man vs espie
Whiles we worchen in þis philosophie
Al as he bad fulfilled was in dede
This ilke seruaunte anoon riȝt out ȝede
And his maistere shitte þe dore anone
And to her laboure spedely þei gone
  
This preest at þis cursed chanons biddynge
Vppon þe fure anon sette þis þinge
And blewe þe fire and busied hym ful fast
And this chanon into þis croslette cast
A powdere I note wherof it was
Imade eiþer of chalk or ellis of glasse
Or somwhat ellis was not worþ a flie
To blynde wiþ þis preest and bad hym hie
Thise coles forto cowchen al aboue
The crosselette for in token þat I þe loue
Quod þis Chanon þine hondes twoo
Shal worche al þing which as shal be doo
Graunt mercy quod þe preest and was ful glad
And cowched coles as þe chanon bad
And þe whilys he bisy was þis feendly wreche
This fals chanon þe foule fende hym fecche
Out of his bosom toke a bechen cole
In which ful sotilly was made an hole
And þerin pitte was of siluere lymaille
An vnce and stopped was wiþout faille
This hoole wiþ wex to kepe þe lymaille Inne
And vnderstondeþ þat þis fals gynne
was not made þere but it was made bifore
And oþer þingges I shal telle more
Hereafterward which þat he wiþ hym brouȝt
Ere he come þere to begile hym he þouȝt
And so did er þei went atwynne  
Til he had turned hym couþe he nat blynne
It dulleþ me whan þat I of hym speke
On his falshede fayn wolde I be awreke
If I wist howe but he is here and there
He is so variaunt he bitte no where
But takeþ hede nowe sirs for goddys loue
He toke his cole of whiche I speke aboue
And in his honde he bare it prively
And whiles þe preest couched bisyly
  
þe coles as I tolde ȝou er þis
þis Chanon seide frende ȝe done amys
þis is not couched as it ouȝt be
But sone I shal amende it quod he
Now lat me medle þerwiþ but a while
ffor of ȝou haue I pite be seint gyle
Ȝe bene riȝt hoote I se wel howe ȝe swete
Haue here a cloþe and wipe away þe wete
And whilys þe preest his wy haas
þis chanon toke his cole I shrewe his faas
And laide it vpon abouen þe mydward
Of þe Crosselette and blewe wel afterward
Til þat þe Coles gonne fast brenne
Nowe ȝeue vs drynk quod þe chanon þen ·
As swith  al shal be wel I vndertake
Sitte we adoun and lat vs mery make
And whan þe chanons bechen cole
Was brentte al þe lymaille out of þe hole
Into þe Crosselette anon fille adoun
And so it most nedes by resoun
Siþ it so euen aboue couched was
But þerof wist no þing þe preste allas
He demed al þe coles liche good
ffor of þe scleiȝt no þinge he vnderstood
And whan this Alkamystere segh his tyme
Riseþ vp sire preest and stondeth by me 
And for I wote wele Ingot haue ȝe none  
Goþ walkeþ forþ and bringeþ a chalk stone
ffor I wil make it of þe same shap
That is an Ingot ȝif I may haue happe
And bringe wiþ ȝou a bolle or a panne
fful of water and ȝe shul see þan
Howe þat oure bysynesse shal happe and preue
And ȝit for ȝe shul haue no mysbileue
Ne wronge conceite of me in ȝoure absence
I wil not bene out of ȝoure presence
  
But go wiþ ȝou and come wiþ ȝou agayn
þe Chambere door shortely to sayn
They opned and shette and went forþ her way
And forþ wiþ hem þei karied þe kay
And comme ageyn wiþout eny delay
What shuld I tary al þe longe day
He toke þe chalk and shope it in þe wise
Of an Ingot as I shal ȝou deuyse
I saie he toke out of his owne scleue
A teyne of siluere euel mote he cheue
Whiche þat was but an vnce of weiȝt
And takeþ hede nowe of þis cursed scleiȝt
He shope his Ingot in length and in brede
Of þe teyne wiþout eny drede
So sclyȝly þat þe preest it not aspied
And in his scleue agayn he gan it hide
And from þe fire toke vp his matere
And into þe Ingot it pitt with mery chere
And into þe water vessel he it cast
whan þat him list and bad þe preest as fast
Loke what þer is pitte in þine honde and grope
Thow shalt fynde þere siluer as I hope
What deuel of helle shuld it ellis be
Shavynge of siluere  siluere is parde
He pitte In his honde and toke vp a teyne
Of Syluere fyne and glad in euery veyne
was þis preest whan he segh þat it was so  
Goddys blessing and his moders also
And alle halowes haue ȝe sir chanōn
Saide þe preest and I her malyson
But and ȝe vouchesauf to teche me
This noble craft and þis sotilte
I wil be ȝour in all þat euere I may
Quod þe Chanon ȝit wil I make assay
The secounde tyme þat ȝe mow take hede
And bene expert of þis and in ȝour nede
  
Anoþer day  in myne absence
This disciplyne and þis crafty science
 Lat take anoþer vnce quod he þoo
Of quik siluer wiþout wordes moo 
And doo þerwiþ as ȝe han done er þis
With þat oþer which þat now siluer is
This preest hym busieþ in al þat he can
To done as þis chanon þis cursed man
Comaundeþ hym and fast bloweþ þe fuyre
fforto come to þe effecte of his desire
And þis chanon riȝt in þe mene while
Al redy was þis preest eft to begile
And for a countenaunce in his hand bare
An holowe stik take hede and be ware
In þe eende of which an vnce and no more
Of syluere lymaille put was al bifore
was in his cole and stopped with wex wel
fforto kepe in his lymaille euery dell
And whilis þis preest was in his bysynesse
This Chanon wiþ his stik gan hym dresse
To hym anon and his powdere cast Inne
As he did eer þe deuel out of his skynne
Hym turne I prey to god for his falshede
ffor he was euer fals in oþe and dede
And wiþ his stik aboue þe crosselette
That was ordeyned wiþ þat fals gette
He stireþ þe coles til relente gan  
The wex agayn þe fuyr as euery man
But it a fool be wote wele and mote nede
And alle þat in þe hole was  out ȝede
And into þe crosselette hastely it felle
The preest supposed no þing but wel
But bisied him fast and was wonder fayn
Supposing nouȝt but trouþe soþ to sayn
He was so glad I can not expresse
In no manere his myrth and his gladnesse
  
And to þe Chanōn he profred eft sone
Body and good ȝe quod þe chanon sone
þouȝe poor I be crafty þow shalt me fynde
I warne þe ȝit is þer more behinde
Is þere eny copoure here In saide he
Ȝe sir quod þe preest I trowe þer be
Ellis goo by some and þat as swithe
Now sir go forþ þi way and hithe
And went his way and with þis coper he cam
And þis chanon it in his honde it nam
And of þat copere weyed out but an vnce
Al to symple is my tunge to pronunce
His monstre as his witte þe doublenesse
Of þis Chanon roote of cursednesse
He semed frendely to hem þat knewe hym nouȝt
Bot he was feendly boþ in werk and þouȝt
It werieþ me to telle of his falsenesse
And nathelees ȝit wil I it expresse
To þat entent men may be ware þerby
And for noon oþere cause trewly
He putt þis vnce of copere into þe crosselette
And on the fuyre as swithe he haþ it sette
And kest In powdere and made þe preest to blowe
And in his worching for to stoupe lowe
As he did erst and al nys but a Iape
Riȝt as him list þe preest he made his Ape
And afterward into the Ingot he it cast  
And in þe panne pitt it atte last
Of watere and in he pitte his owne honde
And in his scleue as ȝe tofornhonde
Herd me telle he had a siluer teyne
He sclily toke it out þis cursed heyne
Vnwetinge þis preest of his fals craft
And in þe pannes botme he haþ it laft
And in þe watere rombleþ too and froo 
And wondere prively toke it vp also
  
þe Copere teyne nat knowing þis preest
And hid it and hente hym by þe breest
And to hym spake and þus seide in his game 
Stowpeþ adowne by god ȝe be to blame
Helpeþ me nowe as I did ȝowe whilere
Putte Inne ȝoure honde and lokeþ what is þere
This preest toke vp þis siluere teyne anone
And þan seide þe chanon lat vs gone
Wiþ þise þre teynes whiche þat we han wrouȝt
To somme goldsmyth and wit ȝif it be ouȝt
ffor be my feiþe I nolde for myne hode
But if þei were siluere fyne and goode
And þat as swiþe proued shal it be
Vnto þe goldsmythe wiþ þise teynes þre
went þei and pitte þise teynes in assay
To fyre and hamere myȝt no man say nay
But þei were as hem ouȝte to be
This sotted preest who was glad but he
Was neuere bridde gladdere aȝeinst þe day
Ne nyȝtyngale in þe seson of may
was neuere noon þat list better to synge
Ne lady lustyer in Carolynge
And forto speke of loue and wommanhede
Ne knyght in armes done an hardy dede
To stonden in grace of his lady dere
Than had þis preest þis craft to lere
And to þe chanon þus he speke and saide
ffor þe loue of god þat for vs deyde 
And as I may deserue it vnto yowe  
What shal þis Receyte cost telleþ nowe
By oure lady quod þis chanon it is dere 
I warne ȝou  for saaf I and a frere
In Engelonde þer can no man it make
No fors quod he nowe sir for goddys sake 
What shal I paye telle me I þe pray
Iwis quod  it is ful dere I saie 
  
Sir at oon woord if þat þe lest it haue
Ȝe shul paye xl li so god me saue
And ne were þe frendship þat ȝe did er þis
To me  ȝe shuld paie more ywis 
This preest þe some of fourty pounde anon
Of nobles fette and toke hem euerechon
To þis Chanon for þis ilk receite
All his worchinge was strawe and deceite
Sir preest he saide I kepe forto haue no loos
Of my craft for I wold it were kept cloos
And as ȝe loue me kepeþ it secre
ffor and men knewe al my sotilte
By god men wolde haue so grete envie
To me by cause of my philosophie
I Shuld be dede þer nys noon oþer waye
God it forbede quod þe preest what say ȝe
Ȝit had I leuere spenden al þe good
Which þat I haue and ellys wexe I wood 
Than þat ȝe shuld fallen in such meschief
ffor ȝoure good wille sir haue ȝe riȝt good preef
Quod þe Chanōn  and sir  oft graunt mercy
He went his way þat neuere þe preest hym sie
Aftere þat day and whan þis preest shulde
Maken assay at suche tyme as he wolde
Of þis Receite  fare wel it wold nat be
Loo þus byiaped and begiled was he
Thus makeþ he his Introducciōn
To bringe folk to her destructiōn
Considereþ surs howe þat in eche astaat
Bytwix men and gold þer is debaat
So fer forþ þat vnneþes þer is oon  
This multiplyinge so blendeþ mony ōn
That in good faiþ I trowe þat it be
The cause grettest of þe grete scarcete
Thise philosophres speken so mystely
In þis craft þat men can not come þerby
  
ffor eny witte þat men han now adayes
Þei may wel Chitere and iangle as don þise Iaies
And in her teemes sette lust and peyne
But to her purpoos shul þei neuere atteyne
A man may liȝtly lerne ȝif he haue ouȝte
To multiplie and bringe his good to nouȝte
Loo suche a lucre is in þis lusty game
A mannes merþe wil it turne al to grame
And empty also grete and heuy purses
And make folk to purchasen curses
Of hem þat han þerto her good ylent
O fy for shame þei þat han be brent
Allas can þei nat flee þe fires hete
Ȝe þat it losen I rede ȝe it lete
lest ȝe lesen all for bette þan neuere is late
Neuere to þrive were to longe a date
Thouȝe ȝe prolle ay ȝe shul it neuer fynde
Ȝe bene as bolde as is bayard þe blynde
That blundreþ forþ and perile casteþ non
He was bolde to renne aȝeinst a ston
As forto goo be sides in þe way
 Soo faren ȝe þat multiplien I say
Ȝif þat oure eyen can nat seen ariȝt
Lokeþ þat ȝoure mynde lak nat his siȝt
ffor þouȝe ȝe loke neuere so brode and stare
ȝe shul nat wynne a myte in þat chaffare
But waasten all þat ȝe may rappe and renne
Wiþdrawe þe fuyre lest it so fast brenne
Medleth no more wiþ þat art I mene
ffor ȝif ȝe doon ȝoure þrift is goon ful clene
And riȝt as swiþe I wil ȝou telle here
What þat þe philosophres seyn in þis matere
Loo þus seiþ alnold of þe newe toune  
As his rosarie makeþ mencioun
He seiþ riȝt þus wiþoute eny lie
Ther may no man mercury mortefie
  
But ȝif it be wiþ his broþers knowlecchinge
Howe þat he which þat ferst seide þis þinge
Of philosophres fader was hermes
He seiþ how þat þe dragon doutelees 
Ne dyeþ nat but ȝif he be sclayn
Wiþ his broþer and þat is forto sayne
By þe dragon mercurye and noon oþer
He vnderstood þat bremstone were his broþer
þat out of sol and luna were ydrawe
And þerfore saide he take hede to my sawe
Lat no man bisie him þis arte forto seche
But he þat þe entenciōn and speche
Of philosophres vnderstonde can
And if he doo he is a lewde man
ffor þis science and þis conyng quod he
Is of þe secree of secrees parde
Also þer was a disciple of plato
þat on a tyme saide his maister too
As his boke somere wil bere witnesse
And þis was his demaunde en soþfastnesse
Tel me þe name of a priue stoōn
And plato answered vnto hym anoōn
Take þe stoon þat Titanos men name
Which is þat quod he magnasia is þe same
His disciple seide ȝe sire and is it þus
þis is ignotum per ignocius
What is magnasia good sire I pray
It is a watere þat is made I saye
Of elementes foure quod Plato
Telle me þe roche good sire quod he þoo
Of þat watere if it be ȝoure wille
Nay nay quod Plato certeyn þat I nyll
The philosophres were sworn echon
þat þei shulde diskeuere it to no mon
Ne in no booke it write in no manere  
ffor vnto crist it is so leef and dere
  
þat he wil nat þat it diskeuered be
But where it likeþ to his deite
Man to enspire and eke forto defende
Whan þat him likeþ loo þis is þe ende
Than conclude I þus siþens þat god of heuene
Ne wil not þat þe philisophres neuene
How þat a man shal come vnto þis stone
I rede as for the best lat it gone
ffor who so makeþ god his aduersarye
As forto worche eny þinge in contrarie
Vnto his wille certes neuere shal he thryve
þouȝe þat he multiplie teerme of his lyue
And þer a poynt for eended is my tale
God seende euery trewe man boote of his bale 
Whan þat þis ȝeman his tale ended hadde
Of þis fals Chanon which þat was so badde
Our hoost gan say trewly and in certayn
þis preest was begiled soþly forto sayn
He wenynge forto be a philosophre
Til he lift riȝt nouȝt in his Cophre
And soþly þis preest had a liþer Iape
This cursed chanon put in his hode an ape
But al þis passe I ouer as nowe
Sir doctour of phisik I prey ȝou
Telle vs a tale of some honest matere
It shal be done ȝif þat ȝe wil it here
Saide þis doctour and his tale bygan anon
Now good men quod he harkeneþ euerechon
Ther was as telleþ vs tytus lyneus
A knyght þat cleped was virgineus
ffulfilled of honoures and worþinesse
And stronge of frendes and of richesse
A douȝter he had be his wiff  
And neuere had hee moo in al his lif
ffaire was þis maide in excellent bewte
Abouen euery wiȝt þat man may see
ffor nature haþ wiþ souereyn 
fformed hir in so grete excellence
As þouȝe she wold say loo I nature
Thus can I forme and peynte a creature
Whan þat me list who can me countrefete
Pigmalyon noght þouȝe he alway forge and bete
Or graue or peynt for I dar wel sayn
Apollus Zephirus shulde worche in veyn
Te graue peynte or forge or bete
If þei presumed me to countrefete
ffor he þat is þe fourmer principal
Haþe made me his vikere general
To forme and peint eche erþely creature
Riȝt as me list for al þinge is my cure
Vnder þe mone þat may wayne and waxe
And for my werk · no þinge wil I axe
  
My lorde and I bene fully atte acorde
I made hir to þe worship of my lorde
So doo I alle myne oþer creatures
Of what coloure þei be or what figures
Thus semeþ me þat nature wolde say
This maide was of age xij ȝere and tway
In whiche þat nature haþ such delite
ffor riȝt as she can peynt as lily white
And roody as roose riȝt wiþ such peynture
She peynted haþ þis noble creature
Er she was born vpon her lymes fre
Were also briȝt as such coloures myȝt be
And phebus died had her tresses grete
Like to þe stremes of his boorned hete
And ȝif þat excellent was her bewte
A thowsand folde more vertuous was she
In hur ne lackeþ no condicion
Þat is to preise as by discrecion
As wel in body as goost chaast was she  
ffor which she flowred in virginite
Wiþ al humilite and abstinence
Wiþ alle attemperance and pacience
Wiþ mesure eke in beringe of araye
Discrete she was in answering alwaye
And she was wis as pallas dar I seyn
Hir facon eke ful womanly and pleyn
Noon counterfeted teermes had shee
 To seme wise but after her degree
She spak and alle her wordes more and lasse
Sownynge in vertue and in gentelnasse
Shamefast she was in maidens shamfastnesse
Constant in hert and euere in bysynesse
To drive hur out of her scloggardrie
Bachus had of her mouþe no maistrie
ffor wille and þouȝt done Venus encrece
As men in fire wil casten oile or grece
  
And of her owne vertue vnconstreyned
She haþe ful oft tyme hur seke feyned
ffor þat she wolde flee þe companye
where likly was to treten of folye
As is at feestys Reuels and daunces
Whiche bene occasion of daliaunces
Suche þingges maken children forto be
To sone ripe and bolde as men may see
Which is ful perilous and haþ bene ȝoore
ffor al to sone may she lerne lore
Of boldnesse whan she is a wiff
And ȝe Maistresses in ȝoure olde liff

Ne takeþ of my wordes no displesaunce
Thingges þat bene sette in gouernyngges
Of lordys douȝters oonly for two þingges
Oyþer for ȝe han kepte ȝoure honeste
Oyþere ellis ȝe han falle in freelte
And knowen wel ynouȝe þe olde daunce
And konne forsake fully  meschaunce
ffor euermoo þerfor for cristes sake

Can kepe a forest best of eny man
Now kepeþ hem wel for and ȝe wil ȝe can

Lest ȝe be dampned for ȝoure euel entente

Whiles þei bene vnder gouernaunce

Suffiseþ oon ensample nowe as here
ffor I mot turne aȝein to my matere
 This maide of which I telle my tale expresse
She kept her self her neded no maistresse
ffor in her lyuynge maidens myȝt rede
As in a booke euery good woord and dede
Þat longeþ to a maide vertuous
She was so prudent and so bounteuous
ffor whiche  out spronge on euery side
Both of her bewte and of her bounte wide
Þat þorowe þe londe þei preised hure echon

 And glad is of his sorowe and vnhele
The doctoure makeþ þis descripcioun
This maide went on a day into þe toun
Toward þe temple wiþ her modere dere  
As is of yonge maidens þe manere

And so bifelle þis Iuge his eyen cast

So was he kauȝt wiþ þe bewte of þis maide
And to him silf ful priuely he saide
This maide shal be myn for eny man
Anon þe feende into his hert ran
And tauȝt him sodeynly by what scliȝt
The maide to his purpoos wynne he myȝt
  
ffor certis by no force ne by no mede
Him þouȝt he was not able forto spede
ffor he was stronge of freendes and eke she
Confeermed was in such souereyn bewte
þat wel he wist he myȝt her neuere wynne
As forto make here wiþ hur body synne
ffor whiche wiþ grete deliberacioun
He sent after a clerk into þe toune
þe whiche he knewe for subtile or for bold
This Iuge vnto þis clerk his tale haþ told
In secre wise and made him to assure
He shulde telle it to no creature
And if he did he shulde lese his hede
whan assented was þis cursed rede
Glad was þe Iuge and made glad chere
And ȝaue hym ȝiftes precious and dere
whan shapen was all þis conspiracie
ffrom poynt to poynt how þat þis lecherie
Perfourmed shulde be ful sotelly
And ȝe shul here afterward openly
Home gooþ this clerk þat hiȝt Claudius
This fals Iuge þat hiȝt apius
So was his name for it is no fable
But knowen for an historial þing notable
The sentence of hit soþ is out of dowte  
This fals Iuge goþ nowe fast aboute
To hasten his delit and þat he may
And so bifelle sone after on a day
This fals Iuge as telleþ vs þe story
As he was wonned in his consistorie
And ȝaf his doomes vpon sondrie caas
This fals Clerk came forþ a wel good paas
And saide lord if þat it be ȝoure wille
As doþ me riȝt vpon þis pitous bille
In whiche I pleyn vpon Virginius
And ȝif þat he wol sayn it is nat þus
  
I will proue it and fynde good wittnesse
þat soþe is þat my bille wil expresse
Þe Iuge answerde of þis in his absence
I may not ȝeue diffinitif sentence
Lat doon hym calle and I will gladly here
þou shalt haue riȝt and no wronge here
Virginius came to witte þe Iuges wille
And riȝt anoon was rad þis cursed bille
 The sentence of hit was as ȝe shul here
To ȝowe my lord sir Apius so dere
Sheweþ ȝour poor seruaunte Claudius
How þat a knyȝt called Virginius
Aȝeinst þe lawe aȝeinst al equite
Holdeþ expresse aȝeinst þe wille of me
My seruaunt which þat is þral be riȝt
Which from myn hous was stolen on a nyȝt
Þe whiles she was ful ȝenge I wil it preue
By witnesse lord so þat ȝe ȝou nat greue
She is nat his douȝtere what so he saye
wherfore my lord þe Iuge to ȝou I praye
Ȝeelde me my thrall if þat it be ȝour wille
loo þis was alle þe sentence of þe bille
Virginius gan vpon þe clerk biholde
 But hastely er he his tale tolde
he wold haue defended it as shuld a knyȝt
And by witnesse of mony a trewe wiȝt
That al was fals þat saide his aduersarie  
This cursed Iuge wold no lenger tarye
Ne here oon woord more of Virgyneus
But ȝaf his Iugement and saide þus
I deme anoon þis clerk his seruaunte haue
Thow shalt no longer in þine hous hir saue
Goo bringe hir forþ and put hur in our warde
This Clerk shal haue his þrall þus I awarde
And whan þis worþi knyȝt Virgineus
Thorgh þe assent of þe Iuge Apius
  
Most by force his dere douȝtere ȝeuen
Vnto the Iuge in lecchery to lyuen
He gooþ hym home and sette hym in his halle
And lete anoon his deer douȝter calle
And wiþ a face dede as asshen colde
Vpon her humble face he can biholde
Wiþ faders pite stikyng þorgh his herte
Al wold he nat from his purpoos conuerte
Doughtere quod he Virginea be þi name
Þer bene twoo weies oiþer deþ oiþer shame
Þat thow most suffre allas þat I was bore
ffor neuer þou deseruedest wherfore
To dyen wiþ a sweerd or wiþ a knyf
O dere douȝter ender of my lif
Which I haue fostred vp wiþ such plesaunce
Þat þou ne were out of my remembraunce
O doughtere which þat art my last woo
And in lif my last Ioie also
O gemme of chastite in pacience
Take þou þi deþ for þis is my sentence
ffor loue and nat for hate þou most be dede
My pitous honde mote smyten of þine hede
Allas þat euer Apius þe say
Thus haþ he falsly Iuged þe to day
And tolde hur al þe caas as ȝe bifore
Haue herd it nedeþ telle it no more
Mercy dere fadere quod þis maide
And wit þat word she boþ hure armes laide
Aboute his nek as she was wonned to doo  
Þe teeres brosten out of her eyen twoo
Ad saide good fadere shal I dye
Is þere no grace is þer no remedye
No certes dere douȝter myn quod he
Than ȝeue me leue fader myn quod she
My deþ  to compleyn a litel space
ffor parde Ieffa ȝaue his douȝtere grace
  
fforto compleyn er he her sclouȝe alas
And god it woot no þing was his trespas
But þan she ranne her fader first to see
To welcome him wiþ grete solempnite
And wiþ þat word she felle a swoun anon
And aftere whan her swownyng was agon
She riseþ vp and to her fadere saide
Blessed be god þat I shal die a maide
Ȝeue me my deeþ er þat I haue a shame
Doþ wiþ ȝoure childe ȝour wille a goddys name
And wiþ þat word she preieþ  ful oft
That wiþ his swerde he shuld smyte her soft
And wiþ þat woord in swowne doune she felle
Hur fadere wiþ ful sorowful hert and felle
Hure hede of smote and by þe top it hent
And to the Iuge he ȝaue it to present
As he satte in his doome in consistorie
And whan þe Iuge it seie as seiþ þe storie
He bad take him and honge hym also fast
But riȝt anoon al þe puple in þrast
To saue þe knyȝt for rewþe and for pite
ffor knowen was þe fooles iniquite
The puple anoon had suspecte in þis þinge
By manere of þis clerkes chalengynge
Þat it was by þassent of Apius
Þei wist wel þat he was lecherus
ssor which vnto þis Apius þei gon
And casten hym in prison riȝt anōn
Wher as he sclough hym self and Claudius
Þat Seruaunte was vnto þis Apius
Was demed forto honge vpon a tree  
But Virginius of his grete pite
Preide for hym þat he was exiled
And ellis certys he had be begiled
The remenant were honged more and lesse
þat consented were to þis cursednesse 
  
Here may men see howe synne haþ his merite
Be ware for no man woote how god wil smyte
In no degree ne in which manere wise
þe worme of conscience wil arise
Of wicked lif þough it so prive be
þat no man woote of it but god and hee
Where he be lewde man or lered
He note howe sone he may be afered
Therfore I rede ȝou this counsel take
fforsakeþ synne er synne ȝou forsake

Our hoost gan swere as he were wood
Harowe quod he by nailles and by blood
This was a cursed þeef a fals Iustise
As shameful deeþ as herte can deuise
Come to þe Iustise and her aduocas
Algates þis sely womman is sclayn alas
Allas dere abouȝte she bewtee
Wherfore I say alday þat man may se
That ȝift of fortune or of nature
Bene cause of deþ of mony a creature

Allas so pitously as sche was slayn  
As boþ ȝiftes as I speke of nowe
Men han ful oft more harme þan prowe
But trewly myne owne maister dere
This is a pitous tale for to here
But naþelees passe ouer is no fors
I prey to god to saue þi gentile cors 
And þine vrynales and þi Iordans
Þine ypocras and eke þi Galyans
And euery box ful of þi letwarye
God blesse hem and our lady seint Marye
So mote I the þou art a propre man
And like a prelate by seynt Runyan
Saue þat I can not speke wel in terme  
But wel I woote þou doost myn hert eerme
That I haue almost kaught a Cardyacle
By corps boones but I haue triacle
Or ellis a drauȝt of moist or corny ale
Or but I here anoon a mery tale
  
My hert is lost for pite of þis maide
þowe belamy Iohn pardonere he saide
Telle vs some merþe or Iapes riȝt anōn
he shal be done quod he be seynt Runyon
But furst quod he here at þe next ale stake
I wil boþ drink and ete of a cake
But riȝt anon þise gentiles gon to crye
Nay lat hym telle vs of no Rybaudrye
Telle vs some moral þing þat we may lere
Somme witte and þan wil we gladly here
I graunt Iwis quod he but I mote þink
Vpon som honest þinge whiles þat I drink 
Loldingges quod he in church whan I preche
I peyn me to haue an hautyn speche
I ryng it out as rounde as goþ a belle
ffor I can al by roote þat I telle
My teeme is alway oon and euere was
Radix omnium malorum est cupiditas
ffirst I pronouns whennys þat I come
And þan my bulles schewe all and some 
Our liege lordes seel on my patent
þat shewe I furst my body to warent
That no man be so bolde preest ne clerk
Me to distrowbe of cristes holy werk
And after þat telle I forþ my tales
Bulles of popes and of Cardynales
Of patriarkes and bisshoppes I shewe
And in latyn I speke a wordys fewe
To sauer wiþ my predicacion
And forto stirre men to deuocion
Than shewe I forþ my longe cristal stones  
Ycrommed ful of clowtes and of bones
Relikes þei bene as wene men echon
Þan haue I in laton a sholdere bone
Which þat was an holy Iwes shepe
Good men say I take at my wordes kepe
Ȝif þat þis boon be wasshen in a welle
Ȝif kowe or calf shepe or oxe swelle
Þat eny worme hath ete or stonge
About þe hert or ellis þe longe
  
It is hool anon and ferþermore
Of pokkes and of scabbe and of euery sore
Shal euery shepe be hool þat of þis welle
Drynkeþ a drauȝt take hede what I telle
Ȝif þat þe good man þat þe beest oweþ
Wil euery weke er þat þe Cok hym croweþ
ffastinge drink of þis welle a drauȝte
As þilk holy Iwe our eldere tauȝte
His beestees and his stoor shal multiplie
And sirs also it heleþ Ialowsie
And þouȝe a man be fallen in a Ialous rage
Lat maken wiþ þis watere his potage
And neuer shal he  his wif mystrust
þouȝe he þe soþ of hure defaute wost
Al had she taken · preestes tweyn · or þree
Here is a myten eke þat ȝe may see
He þat his honde wil putte in þis myteyn
He shal haue multiplyinge of his greyn
Whan he haþ sawen be it whete or otys
So þat he bringe me good pans or ellis grotys
And men and wommen · oo þing I warne ȝowe
Ȝif eny wiȝt be in þis churche nowe
Þat haþ doo synne horrible  þat he
Dar not for shame of it shryuen be
Or eny womman be she ȝong or olde
That haþ made her husbonde Cukwold
Suche folk shal haue no power ne no grace
To offre to my relikes in þis place
And who so findeþ hym out of such blame  
Thei wil come vp and offre in goddis name
And I assoille hym by þe autorite
Such as my bulle was graunted to me
By þis gaude haue I wonnen euery ȝeere
An C Mark siþens I was pardonere
I stonde like a clerk in my pulpitte
And schewe lewde puples synne ysette
  
I preche so as I haue lered byfore
And telle an hundred Iapes more
Than peyne I me to streche forþ þe necke
And eest and west vppon þe puple I bekke
As doþ a dowue sitting vppon a beerne
Myne hondes and my tunge gon ful ȝeerne
Þat it is ioye to see my bysynesse
Of auarice and suche cursednesse
Is al my prechinge for to make hem free
To ȝeue her pans and namely vnto me
ffor myn entent is nat but forto wynne
And noþinge for correction of synne
I rekke neuere whan þat þei bene buried
þouȝe þat her saules goo o blakburied
ffor certes mony a predicacion
Commeþ ofte tyme of euel entencion
Somme of plesaunce of folk and of flaterye
To bene auaunced by ypocresie
And somme for veynglorie and for hate
ffor whan I dar nat oþer waies debate
Than wil I stynge hem wiþ my tunge smerte
In prechinge so that he shal not sterte
To bene defamed falsely so þat he
haþ trespased to my breþeren or to me
ffor þouȝe I telle nat his propre name
Men shal wel knowe þat it is þe same
By somme signe and oþer circumstaunces
Thus smyte I folk þat don vs displesaunces
Thus spitte I out my venyme vnder hwe
Of holynesse to semen holy and trewe
But shortely myne entent I wil devise   
I preche of no þinge but of Couetise 
Þerfore my teeme is ȝit and euer was
Radix omnium malorum est cupiditas
Thus can I preche aȝeinst þe same vice
Which þat I vse and þat is Auarice
  
But þouȝe my self be giltif in þat synne 
Ȝit can I make oþer folk to wynne
ffrom auarice and soor hem repent
But þat nys not my principal entent
I preche nat but for coueityse
Of þis matere it ouȝt ynowe suffise
Than telle I hem ensamples mony oon
Of olde stories longe tyme agon
ffor lewde puple louen tales olde
which þingges þei conne report and hold
What trow ȝe þe whiles I may preche
And wynne gold and siluere forto teche
þat I wil lyve in pouert wilfully
Nay nay I þouȝt it neuere trewly 
ffor I wil preche and begge in sondry londys
I nyl do no laboure wiþ my hondes 
Ne make baskettes for to lyve þerby
Because I wil not lyuen ydelly
I wil noon of þe apostels counterfete
I wil haue money  malt chees and whete
Al were it ȝeuen of þe poorest page
Eyþere of þe poorest wydowe in a vilage
Al shulde her children sterue or famyne
And I wil drink þe licourest of þe wyne
And haue a ioly wenche in euery toune
But harkeneþ lordes in conclusioun
Ȝoure liking is þat I shal telle a tale
Now haue I dronken  a drauȝt of corny ale
By god I hope I shal tel ȝou a þinge
þat shal of reson be at ȝoure likinge
ffor þouȝe my self be a vicious man ·
I morale tale ȝit I ȝou telle can 
Whiche Iames went to preche forto wynne   
Now holdeþ ȝoure pees my tale I wil bygynne 

In fflanndres whilom was a companye
Of yonge folk þat haunted folye
As hasard Riot  stewes  and tauernes 
Harpes  Rubibes  lutes and giternes 
Þei dauncen and pleyen at þe dys nyȝt and day
and Eten also ouer þat her myȝt may
Thorgh whiche þei do þe deuel sacrifise
Wiþin þe deuels temple in sondry wise
By superfluite abhominable
Her oþes bene so grete and damnable
Þat it is grisly forto here hem swere
Our blessed lordys body þei totere
Hem þouȝt þe Iwes rent hym nat ynowe
And ilk of hem at oþer synne loowe
And riȝt anon commen Inne þan tomblesters
ffetys and smale and ȝong fruters
Syngers wiþ harpes  bawdes and waifrers
Such bene verrey þe deuels officers 
To kyndel and blowe þe fyre of leccherye
That is annexed to glotenye
The holy writt take I to witnesse
Þat lecherie is in wyne and dronknesse
 Lo howe þat dronken Loth vnkindely
Lay by his douȝters two vnwittyngly
So dronken he was he nyst what he wrouȝt
Herodes who so haþ þe stories souȝt
     

  whan he of wyne was replete at his feest
Riȝt at his owne table ȝaf his heest
To sleen þe baptist Iohn ful giltelees
Senec saiþ a good word doutelees 
He seiþ he can no difference fynde
Betwix a man þat is out of his mynde
And a man þat is dronklewe
But þat woodenesse is fallen in a shrewe
Perseuereþ lenger þan doþ dronknesse
O gloteny ful of Cursednesse 
O cause furst of our confusion  
Oryginal of our dampnacion
Til crist had bouȝt vs wiþ his blood agayn
Lo how dere shortely forto sayne
Abouȝt was þe Cursed vilanye
Corrupte was as þis world þorgh glotenye
Adam oure fadere and his wif also
ffrom paradis to labour and to woo
Were driven for þat wise it is no drede
ffor whiles þat adam fasted as I rede
He was in paradys and whan þat hee
Ete of þe fruyte defended on þe tree ·
Anoon he was out cast to woo and peyne
O glotenye on þe wel ouȝt vs pleyne
O wist a man how mony maladyes
ffoloweþ of excesse and of glotonyes
He wolde bene þe more mesurable
Of his diete sitting at his table
Allas þe short þrote þe tender mouþe
Makeþ þat Est and West norþe and souþe
In erthe in eire in watere men to synk
To geten a gloton deynte mete and drink
Of þis matere o poule wel cast þou trete
Mete vnto wombe and wombe eke vnto mete
Shal god distroie boþ as Powle seiþ
Allas a foule þinge it is be my feiþ 
  
To saie þis worde and foulere is þe dede
Whan men so drinken of þe white and rede

Thorgh þilk cursed Superfluite
Þe Apostel wepinge seiþ ful pitously

I saie it nowe weping wiþ pitous vois
Þer bene enemyes of cristes croys
Of whiche þe eende is deþ  Wombe is her god
O woombe o baly  o stynking cod

At eiþer eende of þe foule is þe seson
Howe grete cost and labour is to fynde  
Thise Cokes howe þei stampe streyne and grynde
And turnen substance into accident
To ffulfille alle þe likerous talent

Of spicery of leeues berk and roote
Shal bene his sause ymade be delite
To maken hym ȝit a newe appetite
But certes he þat haunteþ suche delices
Is dede whiles þat he lyueþ in þoo vices
A lecherous þinge is wyne and dronknesse
It is ful of strivinge and of wrecchednesse
O dronken man disfigured in þi face
ffoule is þi breeþ foule art þou to enbrace
And þorgh þi dronken nose souneþ þe soune
As þouȝe þou seidest ay Sampson Sampsoun
And ȝit god woot sampson dronk neuere no wyne
Þow fallest as it were a dronken swyne
Þi tunge is lost and alle þine honest Cure
ffor drunknesse is verray sepulture
Of mannys witte and his discrecion
In whoom þat drink haþ dominacion
  
He can no counsaile kepe it is no drede
Nowe kepe ȝou from þe white and fro þe rede
Namely from þe white wyne of lepe
Þat is to selle in fisshstrete and in chepe
This wyne of spayn crepeþ subtilly
In oþer wynes growinge faste by
Of woche riseth suche fumosite
Þat whan a man haþ dronke a drauȝt or þre
And weneþ þat he be at home in chepe
Þan is he in spayn riȝt at þe toune of lepe
Nouȝt at the rochell ne at burdeux toun
And þan wil þei say  Sampson sampsoun
But harkeneþ lordingges oo þing I ȝou pray
þat alle þe souereyn actes dar I say
Of victories in olde testament  
þat þorghe verrey god þat is omnipotent
Weren doon in abstinence and in preiere
Lokeþ þe bible and þer ȝe may it lere
Lokeþ Attila þe grete conquerour
Deide in his sclepe wiþ shame and dishonour
Bledinge at his nose in dronknesse
A Captayn shuld live in sobrenesse
And ouer al þise avise ȝow riȝt well
What was comaunded vnto lamuell
Not Samuel but lamuel say I
Redeþ þe bible and fyndeþ it expresly
Of wyne ȝeuynge of hem þat aren Iustise
No more of þis for it may suffise
And now þat I haue spoken of glotenye
Nowe wil I defende ȝou hasardye
 Hasard is verrey modere of lesingges
And of disceite cursed forswerynges
Blaspheme of crist mansclaughter and waast also
Of bataile and of tyme and of ferþermoo
It is repreef and contrarie to honoure
fforto be holden a comon hasardoure
  
And euer þe hier he is of estate
The more he is holden desolate
Ȝif þat a prince vse hasardie
In al gouernance and polecye
He is as by comon opinion
Holde þe lasse in reputacion
 Stilboon þat was holde a wise embassatour
Was sent into Corinth with grete honour 
ffro Calidoyne to make hem alliance
And whan he came happed þis chance
And al þe grettest þat were of þat lond
Pleiyng at þe hasard he hem fond
ffor which as sone as þat myȝt be
He stale hym home aȝein to his cuntre
And saide þere I wold not lese my name
I wold nat take on me so gret diffame
fforto allye ȝou to noon hasardours ·  
Sendeþ oþer wiser embassatours 
ffor by my trouþe me were leuere dye
Þan I shuld  ȝow to hasardours allie
But ȝe þat bene so glorious in honoures
Shal not allie ȝou wiþ hasardoures 
As by my wille ne as by my trete
This wis philisophre þus seide hee
Loke eeke þat to þe kinge Demetreus
The kyng of partes as þe booke seiþ þus
Sent hym a paire of golden dys in scorne
ffor he had vsed hasardrie þer byforne
ffor whiche he heelde his glorie and his renoun
ffor no value of reputacioun
lordes myght fynde oþer manere playe
Honest ynowe to dryue þe day awaye
Now wil I speke of oþes fals and grete
A worde or twoo as oþer bookes entrete 
Grete sweringe is a þing abhominable
And fals sweringe is moche more reproueable
  
The highe god forbere sweryng at alle
Witnesse of mathewe but in speciall
Of swerynge  þe holy Ieremye
Thowe shalt swere soþe þine oþes and not lie
And swere in doome and eke in riȝtwisnesse
But ydel sweringe is a cursednesse
Biholde and see þat in þe first table
Of hie goddes heestes honurable
How þat twoo heestes of hym is þis
Take not my tale in ydelnes amys
Loo raþer he forbedeþ such swerynge
Than homicide or eny oþer þinge
I saie as þus by order it stondeþ
This knowen þat heestes vnderstondeþ
How þat þe Secounde heest of god is þat
And ferþer ouer I wil þe telle al plat
Þat vengeance shal not part from his hous
Þat of his oþes is so outrageous
By goddys precious hert and his nailles  
And by his blood þat is in hailles
Seuen is my chaunce and his v and thre
By goddys armes ȝif þou falsly plaie me
This daggard shal þorgh þine hert goo
This fruite commeþ of þilk bones twoo
fforsweringe Ire falsenesse homyside
Now for þe loue of crist þat for vs dyde
Leueþ ȝoure oþes bothe grete and smale
ffor I shal telle ȝou a mervelous tale 
Thise Riotours of which I telle
Longe erste er prime ronge eny belle
Were sette in a tauerne for to drynke
And as þei satte þei herd a belle chink
Byforn a corps was caried to his graue
Þat oon of hem can calle to his knaue 
Goo bette quod he and aske redely
What coors is þat þat passeþ forþ by
  
And loke þat þou report his name well
Sire quod þis  it nedeþ neuer a dell
It was me tolde eer ȝe came heer two houres
He was parde an olde felawe of ȝoures
Al sodeynly was he sclayn tonyȝt
ffordronken as he satte vpon his bench vpriȝt
Ther come a prive þeef men clepen deþe
Þat in his contray al þe puple scleeþ
And wiþ his speer he smote his hert atwoo
And went his way wiþoute wordes moo
He haþ a thousand sclayn þis Pestilence
And maistere er ȝe come in his presence
Me þenkeþ þat it were necessarie
ffor to be war of such an aduersarie
Beeþ redy forto mete hym euermore
Thus tauȝt me my dame I saye no more
 By seint marye saide þis tauernere
Þe Childe seiþ sooþ for he haþ sclayn to ȝere
hens ouer a myle wiþInne a grete vilage
Both man and womman childe and page
I trowe his habitacioun be þere  
To bene avised grete wisdome it were
Er þat he did a man dishonoure
Ȝe goddes armes quod þis Riatoure
Is it suche perile wiþ hym forto mete
I shal hym sechen by stie and by strete
I make a vowe by goddys digne bones
Harkeneþ felawes we þre bene al ones
Lat eche of vs holde vp his honde to oþere
And eche of vs bycome oþers broþer
And we wil slee þis fals traitour deþe
He shal be slayne he þat so monye sleeþe
By goddys dignite er it be nyȝt
Togidere han þise þre her hertes pliȝt
To lif and to dye ilk of hem wiþ oþer
As þouȝe he were his owne born broþer
  
And vp þei sterten and dronken in þis rage
And forþ þei goon towardes þat vilage
Of which þe tauernere haþ spoke byforne
And mony a grisly ooþe han þei sworne
And cristes blessed body þei torent
Þat deeth shal be dede if we may hym hent
Whan þei han goon nat fully a myle
Riȝt as þei wold haue troden ouer a stile
An olde and a poor man wiþ hem mette
This olde man ful mekely hem grette
And saide þus nowe lordes god ȝou see
Þe Prowdest of þise Riatours thre
Answerde aȝein what cherlde wiþ harde grace
Why art þou al forwrapped sauf þi face
Whi lyuest þou so longe in so grete age
This olde man gan loke in his visage
And seide þus for I can nat fynde
A man þouȝe I walked into Ynde
Neiþer in Cite ne in noon vilage
Þat wil chaungen his ȝouþe for myn age
And þerfore mote I haue myn age stille
As longe tyme as it is goddys wille 
Ne deth allas nyl not haue my lif  
Thus walk I like a restlees catif
And on þe grounde which is my moder gate
I knokke wiþ my staf erly and late
And saie leue moder lat me Inne
Loo howe I vanyssh flessh blood and skynne
Allas whan shul my bones bene at reste
Modere with ȝou wold I chaunge my chest
That in my chambere longe tyme haþ be
Ȝe for an heeren cloute to wrappe me
But ȝit to me she wil nat do þat grace
ffor whiche ful welked is my face
And sirs to ȝou it is no curtesie
To speken vntil an olde man vilany
  
But he trespase in word or ellis in dede
In holy writte ȝe may ȝoure self wel rede
 Aȝeinst an ōolde man hoor vpon his hede
Ȝe shuld arise þerfor I ȝeue ȝou rede
Ne doþ vnto and olde man harme as nowe
No more þan ȝe wolde a man did ȝowe
In age if þat ȝe so longe abide
And god be wiþ ȝow wheder ȝe goo or ride
I mote goo þidere as I haue to goo
We nay olde cherle by god þou shalt nat soo
Seyde þise oþer hasardours anone
Thow partest nat so liȝtly be seynt Iohn
Thow spak riȝt now of þilk tratour deþe

Haue here my trouþe as þou art his aspie
Telle wher he is or ellis þou shalt dye
By god and by þe holy sacrament
ffor soþly þou art  of his assent
To scleen vs ȝenge folk þou sals þeef
Nowe sirres if it be to ȝou so leef
To fynde deþ turne vp þis croked way
ffor in þat groue I left hym be my fay
Vnder a tree and þere he wil abide
Ne for ȝoure boost he nyl hym no þinge hide
See ȝe þat ooke riȝt þere ȝe shul hym fynde  
God saue ȝou þat bouȝt aȝein mankynde
And ȝou amende þus saide þis olde man
And euery of þise Riatours ranne
Til þei come to þe tree and þer þei fonde
ffloreyns of gold fyne ykoyned rounde
Wel nyghe a seuen busshells as hem þouȝt
No lenger than aftere deþ þei souȝt
But eche of hem so glad was of þat syȝt
ffor þat þe floreynes so faire be and briȝt
That doune þei sette hem by þe precious hoorde
The worst of hem he spak þe furst word
  
Breþeren quod he take hede what I say
My witte is grete þough I bourde and play
This tresour haþ fortune to vs ȝeuen
In myrþe and iolite our lyf to lyuen
And lightly so as it commeþ so wil we spende
Ey precious goddys hert who wende
Today þat we shulde haue so faire a grace
But myȝt þis gold be caried fro þis place
Home into myne hous or ellis to ȝoures
ffor wel I woote þat all þis gold is oures
Than were we in high ffelicite
But trewly by day it may nat be
Men wold say þat we were þeues stronge
And for oure owne tresour done vs honge
As wisely and as scliȝly as it myȝt
This tresour most ycaried be be nyȝt
Wherfore I rede lat loke among vs alle
To drawe and lat see where þe Cut wil falle
he þat haþ þe curt wiþ herte blith
Shal renne to toune and þat ful swith
To bringe vs brede and drink ful priuely
And two of vs shal kepen sotilly
This tresour wel and if he wil not tarie
Whan it is nyȝt we wil þis tresor carie
By oon assent where as vs likeþ best
That oon of ham broȝt gras in his fest
And bad hem drawe and loke wher it wolde falle  
And it felle on the ȝongest of hem alle
And forþ toward þe towne he went anoon
And also sone as that he was goone
That oon of hem spak vnto þat oþere
Thewe woost wel þou art myn owne sworn broþere
Thi prophite wil I telle þe anon
Thowe woost wel þat our felawe is goon
And here is gold and þat grete plente
Þat shal departed be amonges vs þree
  
But naþelees if I can shape it soo
Þat it departed were amonges vs twoo
Had I not done a frendes turne to þe
Þat oþer Answered I not howe þat myȝt be
I wold wel þat þe gold were oures twoo
What shuld wee doo þat it myȝt be soo
Shal it be counsaile said þe first schrewe
And I shal telle  in wordes fewe
What we shul doon and bringe it aboute
I graunt quod þat oþer out of doute
That by my trouþe I nyl þe nat bywreien
Now quod the furst þou woote wel we be tweyen
And twoo of vs shul strenger be þan oōn
loke whan he is sette and þat anōn
Arise as þouȝe þou woldest wiþ hym play
And I shal ryuen hym þorgh þe sides twey
Whiles þat þow strogelest with hym as in game
And wiþ þi daggere loke þou doo þe same
And þan shal al þis golde departed be
My dere freende bytwixe þe and me
Than may we booþ our lustes fulfille
And play at þe dice at our owne wille
And þus accorded bene þise shrewes tway
To scleen þe þred as ȝe han herd me say
 This ȝongest which þat went to þe toune
fful oft in his hert rolled vp and doune
Þe bewte of þise floreyns faire and briȝt
O lord quod he ȝif it so were I myȝt
Haue al þis tresour to myself alone  
Ther nys no man þat lyueþ vnder trone
Of golde þat shuld lyve so mery as I
And at þe last þe feende oure enemye
Put in his þouȝt þat he shuld poysen bey
wiþ which he myȝt scleen his felawes twey
ffor whi þe feende fonde him in such liuynge
That he had leue hym to sorowe bringe
  
ffor þis was vtterly his entent
To scleen hem boþe and neuere to repent
And forþ he goþ no lenger wold he tarye
Into þe towne vnto apotecarye
And preide hym þat he hym wolde selle
Somme poysen þat he myȝt his rattes kelle
And eke þer was a polcat in his hawe
Þat as he seide his capons had Isclawe
And seide he wolk wreke hym ȝif he myȝt
On vermyn þat destroyen hem by nyȝt
The appoticarie answerd þou shalt haue
A þinge þat as god my saule saue
In al þis worlde þer nys no creature
Þat ete or drink of þis confecture
Nouȝt but þe mountance of a corn of whete
Þat he ne shal his lif anoon forlete
Ȝe sterue he shal and þat in lasse while
Þan þow wilt goon a pace nat but a myle
This poysen þat is so hard and violent
This cursed man haþ in his honde it hent
This poysen in a boxe and siþens he ranne
Into þe nexte strete vnto a man
And borowed hym large botelles þre
And to his felawes aȝein repaireþ he
The iij he kepte clene for his drinke
ffor alle þe nyȝt he shope hym forto swynk
In cariyng of þat gold out of þat place
And whan þis riotour wiþ sory grace
Had filled wiþ him his grete botels þre
To his felawes aȝein repaireþ he
What nedeþ it to sermon þerof more  
ffor riȝt as þei had cast his deeþ byfore
Riȝt so þei han hym sclayn and þat anon
And whan þat þis was doon þan speke þat on
Now lat vs sitte and drink and make vs mery
And afterward we wil his body bery
  
And after þat hit happed hem percas
To taken a botell wherin the poyson was
And drank and ȝaue his felawe drink alsoþe
þorghe whiche anoon þei steruen bothe
But certes I suppose þat Auicen
Wroote neuer in no canon ne in no fen
Moo wondere sorowes of empoysenynge
Thus had þise wrecches two her endinge
Thus eended be þise homycydes twoo
And eke þis false enpoysoner alsoo
O  cursed synne ful of al cursednesse
O  traterous homycides o Wickednesse
O  glotenye luxurye and hasardrye
Thow blasphemour of crist wiþ vileny
And oþes grete of vsage and of pride
Allas mankinde howe may it betide
That to þi creatour which þat þe wrouȝt
And wiþ his precious blood þe bouȝt
Thowe art so fals and so vnkynde allas
Now good men god forȝeue ȝou ȝour trespas
And kepe ȝou from þe synne of auarice
Myne holy pardon may ȝou all warisshe
So that ȝe offer nobles or sterlyngges
Oiþer ellis Siluere  spoones  broches  or ryngges
Boweþ ȝoure hede vnder þis bulle
Commeþ vp ȝe Wyues offreþ ȝour wille
Ȝoure name I entre here in my rolle anon
In to þe blisse of heuene shul ȝe al goon

Ȝe þat wollen offre as clene and eke as cleere
As ȝe were born and loo sirs þus I preche
And Ihesu crist þat is our saules leche
So graunte ȝou his pardon to receyue  
ffor þat is best I wil ȝou not deceyue
 But sirs oon word forgate I in my tale
I haue relikes and pardon in my male
  
As faire as eny man in engelond
Whiche were ȝeue me by þe popes hond
Ȝif eny of ȝow wol of deuociōn

Commeþ forþ anon and kneleþ here adoun
Þat ȝe may haue part of my pardoun
Or ellis takeþ pardon as ȝe wende
Al newe and fressh at euery tounes ende
So þat ȝe offre alway newe and newe
Nobles and pans which þat bene good and trewe
It is an honure to euery þat bene here
Þat ȝe may haue a suffisant pardonere
To assoile ȝou in contree as ȝe ride
ffor auentures which þat may betide
ffor parauenture þer may falle oon or twoo
Doune of her hors and breke her nek atwoo
Looke swiche a swerte it is to ȝou alle
That I am in ȝoure felawship yfalle
Þat may assoile ȝou boþ more and lasse
Whan þat þe soule shal fro þe body passe

ffor he is most enuolupte of synne
Come forþ sire hoost and offre first anon
And þou shalt kysse þe relikes euerechon
Ȝe for a groot vnbokel anon þi purs
Nay nay quod he þan haue I cristes curs
lat be quod he it shal nat be so theche
Þow woldest make me kissen þine olde breche
And swere it were þe relike of a seynt
Þouȝe it were wiþ þi foundement depeynt
But by þe crosse which seint Elyne fonde
I wold I had þi culyons in myne honde
In stede of relikes of seintwary
Lat kitte hem of and I wil helpe hem cary
They shulde be schryned in an hogges toord  
This Pardonere answered nat a woord
  
So wroþ he was he wolde no word say
Nowe quod our oost I nyl no lenger play
Wiþ þe ne wiþ noon oþer angry man
But riȝt anoon þe worþi knyȝt bygan
Whan þat he seegh þat alle þe puple louȝe

And ȝee sir Hoost þat bene to me so dere

And pardonere I prei ȝou drawe ȝe nere
And as we did lat vs lauȝe and play
And anon þei kissed and riden forþ her way
WHan saide was þis tale euery man
As sober was þat wonder was to see
Til þat our oost Iape byganne
And þan at erst he loked vpon me i chaucers
And saide þus what man art þou quod he
Thow lokest as þow woldest fynde an hare
ffor euer vpon þe grounde I se þe stare
 Approche nere and loke meryly
Now war ȝou sirs and lat þis man han plas
He in þe waast is shape as wel as I
This were a popet in armes to embrace
ffor eny womman smal and faire of faice
He semeþ Elnyssh be his cuntenaunce
ffor vnto no wiȝt doþ he daliaunce
Say nowe somewhat siþens oþere folk han saide
Telle vs a tale of merth and þat anon
Oost quod I ne be nat euel paide
ffor oþer tale certes can I noon
But of a ryme I lered longe agon
ȝe þat is good quod he shul we it here
Som deynte þing me semeþ by his chere
LEstneth lordes in good entent  
And I will telle verrement
Of myrth and of solace
Of a knyȝt was faire and gent
In bataile and in tornament
His name was sir thopace
Iborn he was in fer cuntree
In fflaunders al byȝonde þe see
Att Poperinge in þe place
His fader was a man ful free
And lorde he was of þat cuntre
As it was goddes grace
Sir Thopas was a doughty swayn
White was his face as payndemayn
His lippes rede as Roos
His rudde is like scarlett in grayn
And I ȝow telle in good certayn
He had a semely nose
His heer his beerd was lik saffron
þat to his girdel kauȝt adoune
His shoon of Cordewayne
Of brugges were his hosen broun
His Roobe was of Ciclatoun
That cost mony a rayn
  
He couþe hunte at wylde dere·
And Ride on hawkyng for þe Ryuer
Wiþ grey goshauke on honde
Therto he was a good archere
To wrastling was þer noon his peer
Ther eny ram shulde stonde
fful mony a maide briȝt in boure
þei morn for him Paramoure
Whan þei were bette to sclepe
But he was chaast and no lecchoure
And swete as is þe bremble floure
That bereþ þe reede heppe
And so byfelle vppon a day
ffor soþþe as I ȝowe telle may
Sire Thopaas wold out ride  
He worþ vp on his stede gray
And in his honde a launce gay
A longe swerde be his side
He prikkeþ þorowe a faire forest
Therin is mony a wilde beest
ȝa boþ bukke and hare
And as he prikkeþ norþ and eest
I telle ȝowe hym had almest
Bytidde a sory care
There springen herbes grete and smale
þe lykorice and þe Setuale
And mony a clowe gyloffre
And notemuges to put in ale
Wheþere it be moyst or stale
Or forto lay in Coffre
  
þe birdes syngen it is no nay
þe sparhauke and þe popeniay
þat Ioie it was to here
The þrostel cok made eke his lay
The woode douve vpon þe spray
She songe ful loude and clere
Sire Thopas felle in loue longynge
And whan he hard þe þrostel synge
He prikkes as he were woode
His faire stede in his prikkinge
So swette þat men myȝt hym wringe
His sides were al blood
Sire Thopas eke so wery was
ffor prikkinge on þe soft gras
So feers was his corage
That doune he laide hym in þat plas
To maken his stede som solas
ffor he was so Sauage
O seint Marie Benedicite
What aileþ þis loue at mee
To bynde me so sore
Me dremed al þis nyȝt parde
An Elfe quene shal my lemman be  
And sclepe vndere my gore
And elf quene wil I loue ywis
ffor in þis world no womman is
Worþi to be my make
in toun
Al oþer wommen I forsake
And to an elfe quene I me take
By dale and eke by doune
  
Into his sadel he came anone
And prikkeþ ouere stile and stone
An helf quene forto aspie
Til he so longe haþ riden and goon
That he fonde in a privee woon
þe Cuntry of fary
 so wild
ffor in þat cuntre nas þer noon
     
Neiþer wif ne child
Til him þer come a Ioly geaunt
His name was clepede Sir Olyfaunte
A perilous man of dede
He seide childe by tirmagaunt
But ȝif þou prik out of myn haunt
Anoon I sclee þi stede
 wiþ mace
Here is þe quene of fairie
Wiþ harpe wiþ pipe and Simphony
Dwelling in þis place
The Childe saide so mot I þee
To morowe wil I meten þee
Whan I haue myn Armure
And ȝit I hope par ma faye
þat þou shalt wiþ þis launcelay
Abien it ful sore
 Thorgh þi mawe
Shal I perce ȝif I may
Er it be fully prime of day
ffor here þow shalt be sclawe
  
Sire Thopas drogh abak ful fast
This Geaunt at him stones cast
Out of a felle staf sclynge
But faire eskapeþ child thopa
And al it was þorgh goddes grace  
And þorgh his faire beringe
Ȝit listneþ lordes to my tale
Murier þan þe nyȝtingale
ffor now I wil ȝou rowne
Howe Sire Thopas wiþ sides smale
Prickinge ouer doune and dale
Is come aȝein to toune
His mery men commaunded he
To make hym boþ game and glee
ffor nedes most he fiȝt
Wiþ oon geaunt wiþ hedes þre
ffor paramoure and Iolite
Of oon þat shoon ful briȝt
Do come he seide myn menstralles
And geestours for to telle vs tales
Anon in myn armynge
Of Romance þat bene reales
Of popes and of cardynales
And eke of loue likynge
þei fatte hym first þe swete wyne
    
    
     
And licorice and eke comyne
Wiþ sugre þat is cree
  
He did next his white leer
Of cloþ of lake fyne and clere
A breche and eke a sherte
And next his shert an aketon
And ouer þat an haberion
for peercyng of an herte
And ouer þat a fyne hawberk
Was al ywrouȝt of Iwes werk
fful stronge it was of plate
And ouer þat his cote armour
As white as is þe lily flour
In which he wil debate
His sheeld was of gold so rede
A þerin was a bores hede
A charbocle by his side
And þere he swore on ale and brede  
Howe þat þe geaunt shal be dede
Betide what bytide
His Iaumbeuxe were of quirboile
His sweerde scheeþ of yuory
His helme of laton briȝt
His sadel was of Rowel bone
His bridel as þe sonne shone
Or as þe moon liȝt
His spere was of fyne Cipres
That bodeþ werre and no þing pees
The hede ful sharpe ygrounde
His stede was al dapple grey
It goþ an aumble by þe wey
fful softely and rounde
  
 In londe
Loo lordys myne here is a fitte
If ȝe wil eny more of it
To telle it wil I fonde
Now holde ȝoure mouth for charite
Boþ knyȝt and lady fre
And harkneþ to my spelle
Of Batell and of Chivalrie
And of ladies loue drurye
Anoon I wil ȝou telle
Men speken of romances of price
Of horn childe and of ypotice
Of Befes and of sire gie
Of Sy le boyx and Pleyndamour
But sire Thopace he bereþ þe flour
Of royal chyualrie
His good stede he bystrode
And forþ vppon his way glode
As sparke out of þe brond
Vpon his creest he bere a tour
And þerInne stiked a lilye flour
God shilde his corps fro shonde
And for he was a knyȝt auntrous
He nolde sclepen in non hous 
But ligge in his hode  
His briȝt helme was his wongere
And by hym baite his deistrere
Of eerbes fyne and good
  
Hym self drank watere of þe welle
As did þe knyȝt sire percyvelle
So worþely vnder wede
     
NO more of þis for goddys dygnite
Quod our hoost for þou makest me
So wery of þi verrey lewdenesse
That also wisly god my soule blesse
Myn eeres aken of þi drasty speche
Now such a ryme þe deuel I byteche
 This may wel be cleped ryme dogrel quod he
Whi so quod he whi wilt þou lette me

Siþ þat it is þe best ryme þat I can
By god quod he for pleynly at a worde
Thi drasty rymyng nys nat worþ a torde
Thow dost not ellis but spendest tyme
Sire atte oon worde þou shalt no lenger ryme
Lat see wher þou canst tellen ouȝt in geeste
Or ellis in prose somewhat at þe leest
In whiche þer be somme merth or doctrine
Gladly quod I by goddys swete pyne
I wil ȝow telle a litel þinge in prose

Or ellis certes ȝe bene to daungerous
It is a moral tale vertuous
Al be it tolde somtyme in sondry wise
Of sondry folk as I shal ȝou devise
As þus ȝe woote þat euery euaungelist
That tellen vs þe peyn of Ihesu crist
Ne seiþ al þing as his felawe dooþ
But naþeles her sentence is all sooþ
And al accorden as in her sentence
Al be þer in her tellyng difference

And by þe corps precious Matrian

That good loue my wif had herd þis tale

By goddes bones whan I bete my knaues

And crieth Slee þoo dogges euerychon
And breke of hem boþ bak and boon
And ȝif þat eny neighbour of myne

And crieþ fals coward kepe and wreke þi wiff

And þow shalt haue my distaff and go spynne

Allas she seiþ þat euer I was yshape
To wedde a Milksop or a coward ape
That wil be ouercome wiþ euery wiȝt
Thow darst not stonde by þi wyues riȝt
Þis is my lif but ȝif þat I wil fiȝt

And nouȝt bygeten of mannes sperme vnclene
And wolt al Paradys sauyng oon tree

To laboure and to helle and to meschance

Lo sampson þat was annunciate

And was to god almyȝty consecrate
And stoode in noblesse while þat he myȝt see
Was neuer such a noþer as was he
To speke of strength and þerto hardynesse
But to his wyues tolde he his secree
Thourgh which he sclouȝe hym self for wrecchednesse
 Sampson þis noble and myȝty champion
Wiþoute wepen saaf his hondes tway
He sclough and also torent þe lyon
Toward his weddyng walking by þe way
His fals wif coude hym so wel plese and pray
Til she his counsaile knewe and she vntrewe
To his foos his counsaile gan to wrye
And hym forsoke and toke anoþer newe
Thre hundred foxes toke Sampson for Ire
And alle her tailes he togyder bonde
And Sette þe foxes tailles a fire  
ffor he in euery taile had knytte a bronde
And þei brent al þe cornes of þat londe
And al her oliuerus an vynes eke
A thowsand he sclough eke wiþ his honde
And had no wepon but an asses cheke
Whan þei were sclayn so þrested hym þat he
was wel nye lorn wherfor he gan to preye
þat god wolde of his peyne haue som pite
And sende hym drynke or ellys most he deye
And out of his asses cheke þat was so dreye
Out of a wonge toth spronge anon a welle
Of whiche he dronk ynouȝe shortly to  
     telle
  
By verray force at Algason vpon a nyȝt
Maugre the philistiens of þat Cite
þe gatys of þat toune he haþ vp pliȝt
And on his bak caried hem haþ he
Hie vpon an hille þat men myȝt See
O noble almyȝty sampson leef and dere
Haddest þou nat to wommen told þi secre
In al þis world ne had ben þi pere
This Sampson neiþer Sither dronk ne wyne
Ne on his hede come neiþere rasour ne Shere
    
ffor al þe strength in his heres were
And fully xxti wynter ȝeer by ȝere
He had of Israel þe gouernaunce
But he shal wepe mony a tere
ffor wommen men bryngen to meschaunce
To his lemmon his Dalyaunce he told
That in his herus al his strengthe lay
And falsly to his foomen she hym sold
And sclepinge in her barme vpon a day
She made to clippe or shere his heer away
And made his foomen all his craft to aspyen
And whan þat þei foonde hym in þis aray
þei bounde hym fast and put out his yen
But er his heer was yclipped or shaue
Ther was no boonde wiþ which men myȝt hym bynde
But now he is in prison put in a kaue  
Where as þei made hym at þe querne grynde
O noble Sampson strengest of mankynde
O whilom Iuge in glorie and richesse
Now maist þow wepe wiþ þine eyen blynde
Siþens þow art from wele falle into wrecchednesse
  
The eende of þise catyfs was as I shal say
His ffoomen made a feest vpon a day
And made hym as her foole toforn hem play
And þis was  a temple of a grete aray
But at þe last he made a foule afray
ffor he two postes shoke and made hem falle
And downe fill temple and al þer it lay
And sclough hym self and eke his foomen alle
This is to say þe princes euerechon
And eke a thowsand bodyes were þere sclayn
Wiþ falling of þe grete temple of ston
Of Sampson ne wil I no more sayn
Be ware of þise ensamples olde and playn
þat no man telle her counsaile to her wyves
Of suche þinge as þei wolde haue secre fayn
Ȝit þat it touche her lymmes or hir lyues
Of Ercule this souereyn conquerour
Syngen his werkes lewde and high renoun
ffor in his tyme of strength he bere þe flour
He slowe and raft þe skyn fro þe lyoun
He of Sentawres laide þe boost a doun
He Arpies sclowe þe cruel briddes felle
He golden apples byraft þe dragoun
He drowe out Serbyrois þe hound of helle
He sclowe þe cruel tyraunt Buserus
And made his hors to frete hym flessh and bon
He sclough þe verrey serpent venemous
Of Achiles two hornes breke he on
An he sclowgh Cacus in a kaue of ston
He sclowgh þe geaunte Anteus þe strong
He sclowe þe grisly boore and þat anon
And bare þe hede vpon his nek longe    
Was neuer wiȝt siþen þe world bygan
þat sclowe so mony monstres as did he
Þorghout þis wide world his name ran
What for his strength and for his bounte
And euery Rewme went he forto See
He was so stronge no man myȝt hym lette
And boþ þe worldes ende saiþ trophe
In stede of bondes he a piler sette
A lemman had þis noble Campion
That hight Dianyre fressh as may
And as þe clerkes maken mencion
She haþ hym sent a shert fressh and gay
Allas þis shert and welaway
Evenymed was subtilly wiþall
That ere þat he had wered it half a day
It made his bones from his flesshe falle
But naþeles some clerkes her excusen
By oon þat hight Nessus þat it maked
Be as be may I wil her not accusen ·
But on his bakke þe shert he weres al naked
Til þat his flessh was for þe venyme blaked
And whan he segh noon oþer remedye
In hote cooles he haþ hymself raked
ffor wiþ no venyme deyned he to dye
Thus sterf þis worþi myghty Ercules
Lo who may trust on fortune eny throwe
ffor hym þat foloweþ al þis world of prees
Er he be ware is oft yleide ful lowe
fful wise is he þat hym self can knowe
Beþ ware for whan þat fortune lest to glose
Þan waiteþ she her man doun to throwe
By suche a way as he wold leest suppose

The myȝty trone þe precious tresour
The glorious sceptre and real mageste
Þat had þe kynge Nabugodonosor
Wiþ tunge vnneþ may  discrived be
He twyes nam Ierusalem þe Cite  
The Vessell of þe temple he wiþ hym lad
At Babiloyne was his souereyn See
In which his glorie and his delit he had
The fairest children of þe blood Royal
Of Ierusalem he ded do gilde anonon
And maked eche of hem to bene his cherle
Amon all oþer Danyel was oon
þat was þe wysest childe of euerychon
ffor he þe dremes of þe kynge expowned
Wher as in Caldey clerk was þer noon
þat wist to what fyne his dremes sowned
This prowde kynge lete make a stature of gold
Sixty cubites longe and Seuen in brede
To whiche ymage boþ ȝonge and olde
Comaunded he to loute and haue in drede
Or in a fornays ful of flawmes rede
He shal be brent þat wold nat obeye
But neuere wold assent vnto þat dede
Danyel ne his ȝonge felawes tweye
This kynge of kyngges prowde was and elate
He wende god þat sitte in maieste
Ne myght hym nat byreue of his estate
But sodeynly he lost his dignyte
And like a beest hym semed forto be
And ete hay as an oxe and lay þerout
In reyne wiþ wilde beestes walked he
Til a certeyn tyme was come aboute
  
And like an Egles fetheres was his heeres
His nailes like briddes clawes were
 God releued hym a certeyn ȝeres
And ȝaf hym witte and þan wiþ mony a tere
He þonked god and euere his lyf in fere
was he to doon amys in more trespas
And or þat tyme ylaide was on his bere
He knewe wel þat god was ful of myȝt and grace
His sone which þat hiȝt Baltazar
That heelde þe regne aftere his faders day  
He by his fadere couþe not be war
ffor proude he was of hert and of aray
And eke an ydolater was he ay
His high astate assured hym in pride
But fortune cast hym doune and þer he lay
And sodeynly his regne gan devide
A feest he made vnto his lordes alle
Vppon a tyme and made hem bliþe be
And þan his officers can he calle
Gooþ bryngeþ forþ þe vessels quod he
Which þat my fader in his prosperite
Out of þe temple of Ierusalem byraft
And to oure heghe goddes þonke wee
Of honur þat our elders wiþ vs laft
His wif his lordes and his concubynes
Ay dronken þe whiles her appetite last
Out of þise noble vessels sondry wynes
And on a wal þis kyng his eyen cast
And sawe an honde armelees þat wrote ful fast
ffor fere of which he quoke and sighed sore
This honde þat baltazar made so soor agast
Wrote mane techel phares and no more
  
In al þat londe Magytien was þer noon
þat couþe expoune what þis lettre ment
But Danyel expouned it anoon
And saide king god þi fader sent
Glorie and honour Regne tresour and rent
And he was proude and god no þing dradde
And þerfore god grete wreth vpon hym Sent
And hym byraft þe regne þat he hadde
He was out cast of mannys companye
Wiþ asses was his habitacion
And ete hay as a beest in wete and drye
Til þat he knewe by grace and by reson
That god of heuene haþ domynacian
Ouer euery regne and euery creature
And þan had god of hym compassion
And hym restored his regne and his figure  
Eke þou þat art his sone art proude also
And knowest all þise þingges prively
And art rebel to god and art his foo
Thow drank eke of his vessels boldly
Thi wif eke and þi wenches synfully
Drank of þe same vessels sondry wynes
And heried fals goddys cursedly
Þerfore to þe shapen grete peyn es
This hand was sent fro god þat on þe wall
wrote mane techel phares trest me
Thy regne is done þou waiest not at all
Devided is þi regne and it shal be
To Medes and to perses ȝeuen quod he
And þilk same nyȝt þe kyng was sclawe
And Darius occupieþ his degre
They he þerto nad neiþer riȝt ne lawe
  
Lordyngges herby ensamples mowe ȝe take
How þat in lordship is no sikernesse
ffor whan fortune wil a man forsake
He bereþ away his regne and his richesse
And eke his frendes boþ more and lesse
And what man haþ frendes þorowe fortune
Mishappe wil make hem enemyes I gesse
This prouerbe is ful soþe and ful commune
CEnobia of Palamere þe quene
As writen Persiens of her noblesse
So worþi was in Armes and so kene
þat no wiȝt passed hure in hardynesse
Ne in lynage ne in oþer gentilnesse
Of þe kyngges blood of percy is she descended
I say þat she nad not moost fairenesse
But of hure Shap she myȝt not be amended
Fro childhode I fynde þat she fledde
Office of wommen and into woode she went
And Mony a wilde hertes blode she shedde
wiþ arowes brode þat she to hym sent
She was so swift þat she anoon hem hent  
And whan þat she was elder she wold kille
Lyons  lybardes and beres altorent
And in hure armes weelde hem at her wille
She durst wilde beestes dennes seke
And renne in þe mountayn al þe nyght
And sclepe vndere a bussh she coude eke

Wiþ eny yong man were he neuer so wiȝt
Ther myght no þinge in her Armes stonde
She kepte her maidenhode from euery wiȝt
To no man deyned hure to be bonde
  
But at þe last her frendes han hure maried
To Odonak a prince of þat Cite
Al were it so þat she hem longe taried
And ȝe shal vnderstonde how þat he
Haþ suche fantasies as had she
But naþelees whan þei were knyt in fere
þei lyueden in Ioie and in felicite
ffor eche of hem had oþer leef and dere
Sauf oon þinge that ȝe nolde neuere assent
By no way þat he shulde by hire lye
But onys for it was her pleyn entent
To haue a childe þe world to multiplie
And also sone as she myȝt aspie
That she was nouȝt wiþ child with þat dede
þan wil she suffre hym doon his fantasie
Eftsone and not but onys out of drede
And ȝif she were wiþ childe at þilke cast
No more shulde he playe þilke game
Till xlti daies were past
Than wolde she onys suffre hym doo þe same
Al were this Odenake wilde or tame
He gate no more of hure for þus she saide
It was to wyues lechery an shame
In oþer caas if þat men wiþ hem plaide
Twoo sones by þis odynak had She
The whiche she kepte in vertue and in letture
But nowe vnto oure tale turne wee  
I say þat worshipful creature
And wise þerwiþ and large with mesure
So penyble in þe werre and curteyse eke
No more labour myȝt in werre endure

As wel in vessel as in cloþinge
She was al clad in perry and in gold
And eke she laft not for noon huntynge
To haue of sondry tungges folk knowing
whan þat she leisere had and forto entende
To lerne bookes was al hure likynge
How she in vertue myȝt her lyf dispende
And shortely of þis storie forto entrete
So dughty was her husbonde as she
That þei conquered mony regnes grete
In þe Orient wiþ mony a faire Cite
Appertenent vnto þe mageste
Of Rome and wiþ stronge hond helde hem fast
Ne neuer myȝt her foomen doon hem flee
Ay whiles þat Odenake dayes last

And howe þat all þe processe felle in dede

And after of her mescheef and of her woo
Howe þat she was byseged and Itake
Lat hym vnto my maister Petrarke goo

Or wiþ her mayne putten hem to fliȝt
In kyngges habite went her sonys twoo
As heires of her regnes alle

But ay fortune haþ in her hony galle

And wiþ his legyons he toke his waye

O noble o worþi peter glory of Spayn
Whoom fortune helde so hiȝe in maieste

Of Melane grete Barnabo Viscounte

Whi shuld not I þi fortune acounte
Siþ in estaat þou clomben were so hie
Thy broþer sone þat was þi double alie
ffor he þi Neuewe was and sone in lawe
Wiþin his prison made þe to die
But whi ne howe wote I þat þou were sclawe
Of the Erle Hugelyne of pise þe languour
Ther may no tunge telle for pite
But litel out of Pise stant a tour
In whiche towre in prison put was he
And wiþ hym bene his litel children þre
þe eldest scarcely v ȝere was of age  
Allas fortune it was grete crueltee
Such briddes forto putte into a cage
 Dampned he was to dye in þat prison
ffor Roger which þat bisshop was of pise
Had on hym made a fals suggestion
Thorgh which þe puple gan on hym arise
And putten him in prison in such a wise
As ȝe han herd and mete and drinke he had
So smal þat vnneþes it may suffise
And þerwiþal it was ful poor and bad
In a day byfelle þat in þat houre
Whan þat his  was wonte to be wrouȝt
þe Gailour shette þe doores of þe toure
He herde it wel but he seegh it nouȝt
And in his hert anoon þer felle a þouȝt

Allas quod he allas þat I was wrouȝt

His ȝonge sones þre þer were of age
Vnto hym seide fadere whi do ȝe wepe

Is þer no morsel brede þat  doo kepe
I am so hungry þat I may nat sclepe
Nowe wolde god þat I myȝt sclepen euere

Thus day by day þis childe gan to crie
Til in his faders barme adoune it lay
And saide fare wel fadere I mote dye
And kissed his fadere and dyed þe same day
And whan þe wooful fadere did hym say
ffor woo his armes two he gan to bite
And saide allas fortune and welaway
Thy fals whele my woo I may al wite

Al þouȝe þat Nero were as vicious
As eny feende þat lieth ful lowe adoune
Ȝit he as telleþ vs swetheneus
This wide world had in subieccion
Both eest and west and Septemptrion
Of Rubies Saphires and peerles white
Were al his  browd vp and doune
ffor he  gemmes grete gan delite
More delicate more pompous of araye
More proude was neuere Emperour þan he
þat ilke cloþe þat he had wered a day
Aftere þat tyme he nolde it neuer see
Nettes of gold threde had he grete plente
To fisshen in Tibre whan hym list to pleye
His lustes  as lawe in his degre
ffor fortune as his frende wold hym obeye
He Rome brent for his delicasie
The Senatoures he sclouȝe vpon a day
To here howe þat men wolde wepe and crie
And sclouȝe his broþer and by his sustere 
His modere made he in pitous aray
ffor he her wombe sclitte to byhold
wher he conceyued was so welaway
That he so litel of his moder tolde
No teer out of his eyen for þat siȝt  
Ne came but saide a faire womman was she
Grete wondere is þat he cowde or myȝt
Be Domes man of her dede bewte
The wyne to brynge comaunded he
And dronke anoon noon oþer woo he made
Whan myȝt is Ioyned vnto cruelte
Alas to depe wil þe venyme wade
  
In ȝouthe a maister had þis emperour
To teche hym letture and curtesye
ffor of moralite he was þe floure
As in his tyme but ȝif bokes lye
And whiles his maister had of hym maistrie
He made hym so conynge and so souple
That longe tyme it was or tyrannye
Or eny vice in hym durst vncouple
This Seneca of which  I devise
By cause Nero had of hym such drede
ffor he for vices wold hym chastise
Discretely as by worde and nat by dede
Sire wolde he sayne an Emperour mot nede
Be vertuous and hate tyrannye
ffor which he hym in bathe made to blede
On booþ his Armes til he most dye
This Nero had eke of a custumance
In ȝouþe aȝeinst his maister forto rise
Which afterward hym þouȝt a grete greuance
Therfore he made hym dye in þis wise
But nathelees þis Senec þe wise
Chees in a bathe to dye in þis manere
Raþer þan han a noþer tormentrie
And þus haþ Nero sclayn his maister dere
Now felle it so þat fortune lest no lenger
þe highe Pride of Nero to cherice
ffor þouȝe he were stronge ȝit was she strenger
She þouȝte þus by god I am to nyce
To sette a man þat is fulfild in vice
In heghe degre and Emperour hym calle
By god out of his sete I wil him trice  
whan he leest weneþ sonnest shal he falle
  
The puple roos vp on hym on a nyȝt
ffor his defaute and whan he it aspied
Out of his doores anoon he haþ hym diȝt
Allone and þer he wende haue bene alied
He knokked fast and ay þe more he cried
The faster schitten þei þe doores alle
Þo wist he wel he had hym self mysgied
And went his way no lenger dorst he calle
The puple cried and rombled vp and doun
That wiþ his eeres herde he what þei seide
Where is þis fals traitour þis Neroun
ffor fere almost out of his witte he breide
And to his goddes pitously he seide
ffor socoure but it myȝt nat betyde
ffor drede of þis him þouȝt þat he dyde
And ranne into a gardeyne hym to hyde
And in þis gardyne fonde he cherles tweye
That sitten by a fuyre ful gret and rede
And to þe cherles twey he gan to preie
To scleen hym and to girden of his hede
That to his body whan þat he were dede
Were no despite ydon for his diffame
Hym self he sclowȝe he coude no better rede
Of which fortune lough and made a game
Was neuere Captayne vnder a kinge
Þat regneþ more putte in subiectioun
Ne strenger was in feelde of al þinge
As in his tyme ne gretter of renoun
Ne more pompous in high presumpcioun
Than olyferne which that fortune ay kest
So lycorously and lad hym vp and doun
Til þat his hede was of er þat he wist
  
Not oonly þat this world haþ of hym awe
ffor lesinge of Richesse and of liberte
But he made euery man renaye his lawe
Nabugodonosor was lord saide he
Noon oþer god shulde honoured be  
Aȝeinst his heest no wiȝt dar trespace
Saue in Betulia a stronge Cite
Wher Eliachym a preest was of þat place
But take kepe of þe deth of Olyferne
Amydde þe hooste he dronke lay al nyȝt
Wiþ Inne his tente large as is a beerne
And ȝit for al his pompe and al his myȝt
Iudith a womman as he lay vpriȝt
Sclepinge his hede of smote and fro his tent
fful prively she stale from euery wiȝt
    
What nedeþ it of kynge Antiochus
To telle his high and Ryal maieste
His hie pride his werke venymus
ffor suche anoþer was neuer noon as he
Redeþ which þat he was in machabe
And redeþ þe proude wordes þat he seide
And whi he felle fro his prosperite
And in an halle how wrechedly he deide
Fortune hym had enhaunsed so in pride
That verrely he wende he myȝt atteyne
Vnto þe sterres vppon euery side
And in a balaunce to wey þe mounteyne
And alle þe floodes of the See Restreyne
And goddes puple had he most in hate
Hem wolde he sclee in torment and  peyn
wenynge þat god ne myȝt his pride abate
  
And for þat Nichamour and thymothe
wiþ Iwes were venquysshed myȝtely
Vnto þe Iwes such an hate had he
That he bad graþed his chare ful hastifly
And swore and saide ful dispitously
Vnto Ierusalem he wolde eftsone
To wreke his Ire on it ful cruelly
But of his purpos he was lette ful sone
God of his manace hym so sore smote
Wiþ vnvysible wounde ay vncurable
That in his guttes carf soo and bote
That his peynes were importable  
And certeinly þe wrech was resonable
ffor many mannys guttes did he peyne
But fro his purpoos cursed and dampneable
ffor al his smerte he nolde hym restreyne
But bad anoon apparaile his Ooste
And sodeynly er he was of it ware
God daunted al his pride and al his boost
ffor he so sore felle out of his chare
That hurte his lymmes and his skyn totare
Soo þat he ne myȝt goo ne ride
But in a chaier men about hym bare
Al forbrused boþ bak and side
The wreth of god hym smote so cruelly
That in his body wikked wormes crepte
And þer wiþ al he stonke so horryblye
That noon of alle his mayne þat hym kepte
whedere þat he woke or ellis sclepte
Ne myght not þe stynk of hym endure
In þis meschief he wailled and eke wepte
And knewe god lorde of euery creature
  
To alle his hooste and to hym self also
fful wlatsom was þe stink of his careyne
No man myȝt hym bere to ne froo
And in his stynk and in his horrible peyne
He starfe ful wrechedly in a mounteyne
Thus haþ þis robbour and homycide
That mony a man made to wepe and pleyne
Such guerdon as bylongeþ vnto pride
The Storie of Alisaundre is so comune
That euery wiȝt þat haþ discrecioun
Haþ herd somwhat or all of his fortune
This wide world as in conclusioun
He wanne by strength or for his hie renoun
They weren glad for pees vnto hym sende
Þe pride of man and beest he laid adoun
Wher so he come vnto þe worldes ende
Comparison myȝt neuere be maked
Bytwix hym and anoþer conquerour  
ffor al þis world for drede of hym Haþ quaked
He was of knyghthode and of fredom flour
ffortune him made þe heir of hur honour
Saue wyne and wommen no þing myȝt aswage
His hegh entente in armes and laboure
So was he ful of louying corage
What pite were it to hym þouȝe I ȝou tolde
Of Darius and an hundred thowsand moo
Of kyngges Princes and Erles bold
Which he conquered and brouȝt into woo
I say as fer as man may ride and goo
The worlde was his what shuld I more devise
ffor þouȝe I write and told ȝou euer moo
Of his kinghode it myȝt not suffise
  
Twelue ȝere he regned as saiþ Machabe
Philippes sone of Macedoyne he was
That furst was kinge of Grece þe cuntree
O worþi gentile Alisaunder alas
That euer shuld  falle Such a caas
Enpoysened of þi folk þou were
Thine  sise  fortune haþ turned into an aas
And ȝit for þe ne weppe she neuere a tere
Who shal ȝeue teeres men to compleyne
The deeþ of gentilnesse and of ffraunchise
That al þe worlde weelded in his demeyne
And ȝit him þouȝt hit myȝt not suffise
So fful was his corage of high emprise
Allas who shal me helpe to endite
ffals fortune and poyson to despise
The which twoo of al this woo I wite
By wisdome manhode and by labour
ffro humblehede and fro Roial Maieste
Vp roos he Iulius þe Conquerour
That all þe Occident by londe and See
By strength of honde or ellis by trete
And vnto Roome made hem tributarie
And Sithens of Rome þe Emperour was he 
Til þat fortune wexe his aduersarie  
A Mighty Cesar þat in Tessalye
Aȝeinst Pompius fader þine in lawe
That of þe Orient had al þe chyualrie
As fer as þat þe day bygynneþ dawe
Thogh þou þorgh þi knyghthode haþ hem take and sclawe
Sauf fewe folk þat wiþ Pompius fledde
Thorghe which þou puttest al þe orient in awe
Thonke fortune þat so wel þe spedde
  
But now a litel while I wil bywaile
This Pompeus þis noble gouernour
Of Roome which þat fleigh at this bataille
I saye oon of his men a fals traitour
His hede of smote to wynne hym fauour
Of Iulius and hym þe hede brouȝt
Allas Pompey of the Orient conquerour
That fortune vnto such a funte brouȝt
TO Rome aȝeine repeireþ Iulius
Wiþ triumphe laureat ful high
But on a tyme Brutus Cassius
þat euere had of his astate Envie
fful priuely had made Conspiracie
Aȝeinst þis Iulius in subtile wise 
And cast þe place in which he shuld dye
With boydekyns as I shal ȝou · devise
This Iulius to þe Capithole went
Vppon a day as he was wonte to goon
And in þe Capitole anoon hym hente
This fals Brutus and his foule foon
And stiked hym wiþ boydekyns anon
Wiþ mony a wounde and þus þei lete hym lye
But neuere grunte he at no stroke but oon
Or ellis at twoo but ȝif his storie lye
So manly was þis Iulius of herte
And so wel loued estately honeste
That þouȝe his dedly woundes so sore smerte
His mantel ouer his hippes cast he
ffor no man shuld se his privete
And as he lay on dyinge in a traunce  
And wist verrely þat dede was he
Of honeste ȝit had he remembraunce
  
 Lucane to þis storie I recomende
And to Sweton and Valerius also
That of His storie writeþ word and ende
How þat þise grete conquerours twoo
ffortune was furst frende and siþen a foo
No man ne trust vpon his fauour longe
But haue hure in awaite euermoo
Witnes on alle þise conquerours stronge
This riche Cresus whilom kyng of lyde
O which Cresus Cyquus sore hym dradde
Ȝit was he kauȝt amonges al his pride
And to be brent men to þe fure hym ladde
But suche a Reyne doune fro þe walken shadde
þat sclouȝe þe fuyre and made hym to eskape
But to be war ȝit no grace he hadde
Til fortune on þe galous made hym gape
Whan he askaped was he can not stent
ffor to bygynne a newe reyne aȝeine
He wende wele for þat fortune hym sente
Suche happe þat he askaped þorȝe þe reyne
Þat of his foos he myȝt not be sclayn
And Suche a sweuen vpon a nyȝt he mette
Of which he was so proude and so fayn
That in vengeance he al his hert sette
Vpon a tree he was as hym þouȝt
Ther Iubiter hym wassh boþ hals and Side
And Phebus eke a faire towale hym brouȝt
To drye hym wiþ an þerfore wex his pride
And to his douȝtere þat stood hym beside
Which þat he knewe in his sentence habounde
He bad hure telle hym what it signyfied
And she his dremes byganne riȝt þus expounde
  
The tree quod she þe galous is to mene
And Iubiter bitokeneþ snowe and reyne
And Phebus wiþ his towale so clene
Thoo bene the sone stremes forto sayn  
Thow shalt an honged be fadere certayn
Rayn shal þe wassh and sonne shal þe drye
Thus warned she hym ful plat and ful playn
His douȝter  þat called was Phanye
An honged was Cresus þe proude kinge
His Roial trone myȝt hym not availe
Tregedie is noon oþer maner þinge
Ne can in synnynge cry ne bywaile
But þat fortune alway wil assaile
wiþ vnware stroke þe regnes þat bene proude
ffor whan men trusten hir þan wil she faile
And keuere her briȝt face wiþ a clowde
Ho quod þe knyȝt no more good of þis
That ȝe han said is riȝt ynowe ywis
And mochel more for litel heuynesse
Is riȝt ynough to mochel folk I gesse

Wher as men haue ben  in gret welth and ese
To here of her sodeyn falle allas
And the contrarye  is Ioye and gret solas
And whan a man hath be  in poor estat
And clymbeth vp  and waxeth fortunat
And ther abidith  in prosperite
Such thyng is gladsom  as thynketh me
And of such thyng  were goodly for to telle
ya quod our hoost  bi seynt poules belle

Riht now ye herde  and parde no remedie

As ye han seid to heer of hevynesse
Sir monk nomore of this  so god you blesse

Such thyng  is nat worth  a bottirflye
Ȝoure tales done vs no sporte ne game
Wherfore sir monke or daun pers by ȝour name

Al þough  sclouþe had neuer be so depe
Than had ȝoure tale ben told in veyn

Nouȝt helpeþ it to telle his sentence
And wel I woote þe substaunce is in me
Ȝif eny þinge shal wel reported be
Sir say somwhat of huntyng I ȝou preie
Nay quod þis monke I haue no lust to pleie
Now lat anoþer telle as I haue told
Þan spak our hoost with rude spech and bold
And saide vnto þe nonnes preest anon
Come nere sir preest Come hider Sire Iohn  
Telle vs such þingges as may our hertis glade

Loke þat þi hert be mery euermoo
Ȝis sir quod he ȝis hoost so mote I goo
But I be mery Iwis I wil be blamed
And Riȝt anoon his tale he haþ atamed
And þus seide to vs euerychon
My tale I wil bygynne anon
A poor wydowe somdel stope in age
was whilom dwelling in a narowe cotage
Besides a groue stonding in a dale
This widowe of which I telle ȝou my tale
Siþens þilk day þat she was last a wiff
In paciens lad a ful sympul liff
ffor litel was hur Catel and hur rent
By Husbondry of such as god her sent
She fonde hure self and eke her doughtred twoo
Thre large sowes had she and no moo
Thre kyen and eke a shepe þat hight malle
fful soty was hur boure and eke her halle
In whiche she ete mony a sclender mele
Of poynant sause hir neded neuer a dele
No deynte morsel passed hur þrote
Hir diete was acordant to her cote
Replecio ne made her neuer seke
Attemper diete was all her phisike
And exercise and hert sufficiance
The goute letted hur no þing to daunce
Ne poplexie shent not her hede
Noo wyne dronke she neiþer white ne rede
Her boord was serued most wiþ white and blake
Milk and broune brede in which she fond no lake
Seyned Bacon and somtyme an eye or tweye
ffor she was as It were a manere of a deye  
A gardyne she had enclosed al aboute
Wiþ stikkes and a drie diche wiþoute
In which she had a cok þat hiȝt chauntilere
In all þe londe of crowing was his pere
  
His mouþ was myrier þan þe mery orgon
On masse daies þat in þe churche goon
Wel sikerer was þe crowyng in his logge
Þan is a clokke or an abbay orlogge
By nature he crewe eche ascencioun
Of Equinoxial of þilk toun
ffor whan degrees xv were descended
þat knewe he þat it myȝt not bene amended
His Combe was redder þan þe fyne Curall
And bateled as it were a castel wall
Ilike azure were his legges and his toone
His bille was blake and as þe gete it shone
His nailles witter þan þe lily floure
And ylike burnysshed gold was his coloure
This gentile Cok had in his gouernaunce
Vij hennys forto doon his plesaunce
Which weren his sustres and his paramours
And wonder like to hym as of colours
Of þe which þe fairest hwed vnder þrote
Was clepe fair Damysel Pertilote
Curtais she was discrete and debonaire
And Companable and bere her self so faire
Siþens þilk day þat she was vij nyȝt olde
That trewly she haþ þe hert in hold
Of Chauntelere loukyn in euery lith
He loued hure so þat wel was hym þer with
But such a Ioie as it was to here hem singe
Whan þat þe briȝt sonne gan to sprynge
In swete accorde my lief is fare a londe
ffor þilk tyme as I haue vnderstonde
Beestes and briddes coude speke and synge
And so byfelle þat in þe dawynge
As Chauntecleer amonges his wyues alle
Sat on his perch þat was in þe halle  
And next hym sat þis faire Pertilote
This Chaunteclere gan gronen in his þrote
  
As a man þat is in his dreme drecched sore
And whan þat Pertilote þus herd hym rore
She was agast and seide hert dere
What eileþ ȝou to grone in þis manere
Ȝe bene a verray scleper fy for shame
And he answerd and saide þus madame
I prey ȝou þat ȝe take it not a greef
By god me mette þat I was in such mescheef
Riȝt nowe þat ȝit myn hert is sore afriȝt
Nowe god  he my sweuen rede ariȝt
And kepe my body out of foule prisoun
Me mette þat I romed vp and doun
Within our yerde wher as I segh a beest
Was lik an hounde and wold haue made arest
Vpon my body and wold haue had me dede
His colour was bytwix white and red
And tipped was his taille and boþ his Eeres
Wiþ blak vnlike þe remenaunt of his heeres
His snowte smal with glowinge eyen tweye
ȝit for his loke almost for fere I dye
This caused me my gronyng doutelees
A voy quod she fie on ȝou hertelees
Allas quod she for by þat god aboue
Now han ȝe lost myn hert and my loue
I can not loue a coward by my faiþe
ffor certes what so eny womman seiþe
We alle desiren ȝif it myȝt be
To han husbondes hardy wise and free
And secre ne noo nygard ne ne fooll
To hym þat is agast of euery tooll
Ne noon avoutour by þat god aboue
How durst ȝe seyn for shame vnto ȝour loue
That eny þing myȝt make ȝou aferde
Haue ȝe no mannys hert and han a berde
Allas and conne ye be agast of swuenes
No þing god woote but vanite in sweuen is    
Sweuens engendren of replexions
And oft of fume and of complexions
Whan humours bene to habundante in a wiȝt
Certes þis dreme which ȝe han had to nyȝt
Commeþ of þe grete superfluite
Of ȝoure rede Colere parde
Which causeþ folk to dreme her dremes
Of Arowes and fires wiþ rede lemes
Of Rede beestes þat willen hem bite
Of contek and of whelpes grete and lite
Riȝt as þe humour of Malecolie
Causeþ  mony a man in sclepe to crye
ffor fere of beeres and boles blake
Or ellis blake deuels wil hem take
Of oþer humoures couþe I telle also
That worken mony a man in slepe ful woo
But I wil passe as liȝtly as I can
Loo Caton which þat was so wise a man
Seid he not þus ne do no force of dremes
Now sire quod she whan we flee fro the bemes
ffor goddis loue as takeþ som laxatif
Vp perile of my saule and of my liff
I counsaile ȝou þe best I wil not lye
That boþ of colour and of Malencolie
Ȝe purge ȝou and for ȝe shul not tarie
Þouȝe þat in þis toune is non Apotecarie
I shal my self to herbes techen ȝou
which shal be ȝoure here and ȝour prowe
And In þe Gardeyne two herbes shal I fynde
þe which han of her proprete by kynde
To purgen ȝou byneþe and eke aboue
fforȝeteþ not þis for goddes awne loue
ȝe bene ful Colerike of complexion
Where þe sonne in his assencion
Ne fynde ȝou replete of ȝour humours hote
And if it doo I dar wel lay a grote
  
Þat ȝe shul haue a feuer terciane
Or an ague þat may be ȝour bane  
A day or twoo ȝe shul haue dygestyues
Of wormes er ȝe take ȝoure laxatyues
Of laureal Centaure and of fumytere
Or ellis of Ellibore þat groweþ þere
Of Catapuce and of gatysburies
Or Erbe Ive grouyng in oure ȝeerd þer mery es
Pek hem vp riȝt as þei growe and ete hem Inne
Be mery husbonde for ȝour fader kynne
Dredeþ no dreme I can say ȝou no more
Madame quod he gramercy of ȝoure lore
But naþelees as touching Danne Catoun
That haþ of wisdome such grete renoun
By god men may in olde bokes rede
Oon of þe grettest auctour out of drede
Of mony a man more of auctorite
Than euer caton was so mot I the
That al the reuers seyn of þis sentence
Han han wel founden by experience
That dremes bene significaciōns
As wel of Ioie as tribulaciōns
That folk enduren in þis lif present
It nedeþ nat to make of þis noon argument
The verrey preef sheweþ it in dede
Oon of þe grettest auctour out of drede
Saiþ þus þat whilom two felawes went
On Pilgrimage in ful good entent
And happed so þei commen into a toune
Wher as þere was such congregacioun
Of puple and eke of streite herbygage
þat þei fande not as moche as a cotage
In whiche þei boþ myght ylogged be
Wherfore þei mosten of necessite
As for þat nyȝt departen of companye
And eche of hem goþ to his hostelrye
  
And toke his logginge as it wolde falle
That oon of hem was logged in a stalle
ffer in a ȝeerde wiþ oxen of þe plouȝe
That oþer man was logged wel ynouȝe  
As was his auenture or his fortune
Þat vs gouerneþ al as in commune
And so byfelle longe er it were day
This man mette in his bed þer as he lay
How þat his felawe gan on hym calle
And saide Allas for in an oxes stalle
This nyȝt shal I be murþered þer I lie
Now helpe me dere broþere er I dye 
In al hast come to me he seide
This man out of his sclepe for fere abreide
But whan þat he was wakened out of his sclepe
He turneþ hym and toke of þis no kepe
Hym þouȝt his dreme was noȝt but a vanyte
Thus twies in his sclepinge dremed he
And at þe iij tyme ȝit his felawe
Come as he þouȝt I am nowe Isclawe
Biholde my blody woundes depe and wide
Arise vp erly in þe morowe tide
And at the west gate of þe toun quod he
A cart ful of donge þer shalt þou see
In which his body is hidde ful priuely
To þilk carte aresten boldely
My golde caused my murder soþ to sayn
And tolde hym euery poynt how he was sclayn
Wiþ a ful pitous face pale of hwe
And trest wel his dreme he fonde ful trwe
ffor on þe morowe as sone as it was day
To his felawes Inne he toke þe way
And whan he come to þis oxes stalle
Aftere his felawe he bygan to calle
The ostelere answerd hym anon
And saide Sir ȝoure felawe is goon
  
As sone as day he went out of þe toune
This man gan falle in grete suspecioun
Remembryng hym on his dremes þat he mette
And forþ he goþ no lenger wold he lette
Vnto þe west gate of þe toune and fonde
A donge cart as he went to donge þe londe  
That was araied in þe same wise
As ȝe han herde þe dede man deuyse
And wiþ an hardy hert he gan to crie
Vengeaunce and iustice on þis vilanye
My felawe murdred is þis same nyȝt
And in þis carte he lith gapinge vp riȝt

That sholde the lawe keep in this Cite
Harrow allas  here lith my felawe sleyn
What sholde I more  vnto this tale seyn
The people out sterte  and caste the carte to grounde
And in the myddis of the donge thei founde
The dede man þat murdred was all newe
O blisful god þat art so Iust and trewe
Loo how þat þou bywreiest mordere alway
Murder wil out þat see wee day by day
Morder is so wlatsom and so abhomynable
To god þat is so Iust and resonable
þat he ne wil not suffre it hilled be
Theigh it abide a ȝeer or twoo or þre
Murder wil out þis is my conclusioun
And riȝt anoon ministres of þe toun
Haþ hent þe Carter and  sore hym pyned
And eke þe Ostilere so fer engyned
That þei biknewe her wikkednesse anoon
And weren honged by þe nek bone
Here may men see þat dremes bene to drede
And certes in the same boke I rede
Riȝt in þe next chapitere I rede of þis
I gabbe not so haue I Ioie or blis
  
Two men þat wolden haue passed þe See
ffor certeyn cause in to a fer contre
If þat þe wynde ne had be contrarie
That made hem in a Cite forto tarie
That stood ful merye vpon an hauen side
But on a daye aȝeinst þe euentide
The wynde gan chaunge and blowe as hym lust
Iolif and glad þei wenten vnto rust
And Casten hem ful erly forto saile
But herken how oo man felle in grete perile
That oon of hem in scleping as he lay
Hym mette a wonder dreme aȝeinst þe day
Hym þouȝt a man stood be his beddys side
And hym commaunded þat he shuld abide  
And saide hym þus if þou to morn wende
Thowe shalt be dreynt my tale is at an ende
He woke and tolde his felawe what he meitt
And preide him his viage forto lette
As for þat day he preide hym to abide
His felawe þat lay by his beddys side
Gan forto laugh and scorned ful fast
No drem quod he may myne hert agast
That I wil lette forto do my þingges
I sette not a strawe by dremyngges
ffor sweuenes bene but vanytees and Iapes
Men dreme alway of owles and of apes
And of mony a mase þerwiþall
Men dremen of þinge þat neuere 
But siþen I see þou wit here abide
And þus forsclewþen wilfully þi tyde
God woote it reweþ me and haue good day
And þus he toke his leue and went his way
And er that he had half his cours assailed
I not whi ne what meschaunce it ailed
But casuely þe shippes botme rent
And ship and man vnder þe water went
  
In siȝt of oþer shippes hym beside
That wiþ hym sailled att þe same tyde
And þerfore he seide Pertelote so dere
By suche ensamples olde maist þou lere
That no man shulde be to rechelees
Of Dremes for I say þe doutelees
That in mony a dreme ful sore is forto drede
Lo in þe lif of seint kenelyne I rede
That was kenulphus sone þe noble kynge
Of Mertenrike how kenelyne mette a þinge
A litel er  was murded on a day
His murdre in his Auysion he say
His norice him expowned euery dell
His sweuen and bad hym for to kepe hym well
ffor treson but he was seuen ȝere olde
And þerfore litel tale haþ he tolde  
Of eny dreme so holly was his herte
Be god I had leuer þan my sherte
That ȝe had herd his legende as haue I
Dame Pertelote I say ȝou trewly
Macrobyus þat writ þe avision
In affrike of þe worþi Ciprion
Affermeþ dremes and seþ þat þer bene
Warnynge of þingges þat men after sene
And ferþermore I pray ȝou lokeþ well
The olde testament of Danyell
Ȝif he heelde dremes of eny vanyte
Rede eke of Ioseph and ye shal See
Wheder dremes be somtyme I say not alle
Warnyng of þingges þat shul after falle
Loke eke of Egipte þe kinge danne Pharao
His bakere and his botelere also
Wher þei ne felt noon effecte in dremes
Who so wil seche of sundry rewmes
May reden of dremes mony a wonder þinge
Loo Cresus which þat was of lyde þe kynge
  
Mette he not þat he satte vpon a tre
Which signified he shuld anhonged be
Lo here Adromacha Ectors wiff
That day þat Ector shuld lete his lif
She dremed on þe same nyȝt byforn
How þat þe lif of Ector shuld be lorn
Ȝiff þilk day he went into bataile
She warned hym but it myȝt not availe
He went forto fiȝten naþelees
But he was sclayn of Achilles
But thilk tale is alto longe to telle
And eke it is nygh day I may not dwelle
Shortly I say as for conclusion
That I shal haue of þis avision
Of aduersitees and I say ferþermore
That I ne wil telle of laxatifs no store
ffor þei bene venemous I wote riȝt well
I hem diffie I loue hem neuere a dele  
NO lat vs speke of merþe and stent al þis
Madame pertilote so haue I blisse
Of oo þing god haþ sent me large grace

Ȝe bene so scarlet rede aboute þe eyen
It makeþ al my drede for to dyen

Mulier est hominis confusio
Madame þe sentence of þis latyn is
Womman is mannys ioy and his blisse
ffor whan I fele on nyȝt ȝour soft side
Al be it þat I may not on ȝou ride
ffor þat oure perche is made so narowe alas
I am so ful of Ioye and solas
Þat I defie boþ sweuen and dreme
And wiþ þat word I fleegh doune fro þe beme
ffor it was day and eke his hennes alle
And wiþ a chukke he gan hem forto calle
  
ffor he had founden a corn lay in þe ȝerde
Real he was no more afferd
He ffeþered Pertelot xxti tyme
And drad as oft er it were prime
He lokeþ as it were a grym lyoun
And on his toes he roomed vp and doun
Hym deyned not to sette his fete on grounde
Ay chokked he whan he had a corne found
And to hym þan ronne his wyues all
Thus Royal as a prince in his hall
Leue I þis chauntelere in his pasture
And aftere wil I telle of his auenture
Whan þe month þe which þe world byganne
That hiȝt marche whan god first made man
Was Complete and passed were also
Siþens Marche bygan xxxti· daies and twoo
Byfelle þat chauntelere in his pride
His seuen wyues welken hym byside ·
Cast vp his eyen to þe briȝt sonne
That in þe signe of Taurus was ronne  
Twenty degrees and oon and somwhat more
He knew by kynde and by noon oþer lore
That it was prime he crewe wiþ blisful steuen
The sonne he saide is clumben vp to heuen
xl degres and oon and more ywis
Madame Pertelote my worldes blisse
Herken how þise blisful briddes singe
And se þe fresshe floures how þei springe
fful is myn hert of Reuel and of solas
But sodeynly hym felle a soriful caas
ffor euer þe latter and of Ioie is sone ygoo
And comonly ofte tyme it falleþ soo
And if arthour coude faire endite

As for a souereyn notabilite
Nowe euery wise man herken me
  
This story is as trewe I vndertake
As is þe booke of launcelote de lake
That women holde in ful gret reuerence
Now wil I turne aȝein to my sentence
A Col foxe  of scleiȝt and iniquite
That in þe groue had wonned ȝeeres þre
By high ymagynacion tofore cast

Into þe ȝeerd þer chauntelere þe faire

And in a bedde of wortes stille he lay
Till it was passed vndren of þe day
Waitynge his tyme on chaunteler to falle
As gladly done þise homycydes alle

Er of his wetyng streyneþ neuer a dele
But by necessite condicionele
I wil not haue to done of such matere
My tale is of a cokke as ȝe shullen here
That toke his counsaile of his wif with sorowe
To walken in þe ȝeerde vpon þe morowe
That he had mette þe dreme þat I ȝou tolde
Wommes counsaile is ful ofte colde
Wommes counsaile brouȝt vs first to woo
And made Adam from paradys to goo
Ther he was ful mery an wel at ese
But for I note whom I myȝt displese
If I counsaile of wommen wold blame
Passe ouere for I seide it in my game
Rede awters wher þei trete of such matere
And what þei seyne of wommen here
Thise bene þe cokkes wordes and not myne
I can no harme of no womman devyne
ffaire in þe sonde to bath hur merely
lith pertelote and al hure susters bye
Aȝeinst þe sonne and chauntelere so fre
Songe meryer þan þe meermaiden in þe See  
ffor phisialogus saiþ witterly
How þat þei syngen wel and merely
And so byfelle as he cast his ye
Amonges þe wortes vppon a botterflie
He was war of this fox þat lay ful lowe
No þinge ne lust hym þan for to crowe
But cries anon cok cok and vp he sterte
As a man þat was affraied in his herte
ffor naturelly a beest desireþ to flee
ffro his contrarie if he may it See
Þouȝe he neuer had seye it erst with his ye
This chauntelere whan he hym gan aspie
  
He wold haue fledde but þat þe fox anon
Saide gentile sir allas what hast þou don
Bene ȝe affraied of me þat am ȝoure frende
Certes sir þan ben ȝe vnhende
If I to ȝou wil harme or vilanye
I am not come ȝour counsaile to aspie
But trewly þe cause of my comynge
was oonly to harken how þat ȝe singe
ffor trewly ȝe han as mery a steuen
As aungel haþ þat is in heuen
Therwith ȝe han in musike more felinge
þan had boys or eny þat can synge
My lorde ȝour fadere god his saule blisse
And eke ȝoure modere and hur gentilnesse
Han in myn hous bene to ȝou grete ese
And Certes sir riȝt fain wold I ȝou plese
But for men speken of syngynge I wil seye
So mot I brouke myn eien tweye
Sauf ȝe I ne herd neuer man so synge
As did ȝoure fader in þe mornynge
Certes it was of hert al þat he songe
And forto make his vois þe more stronge
He wold so peyn hym þat wiþ both his yen
He most wynke so loude he did crien
And stonden on his typtoon þerwiþal·
And strecche forþ his nek longe and small  
And eke he was of such discrecion
That þer nas no man in no region
That him in songe or wisdom myȝt passe
I haue wel red daun Burnel þer as
Amonge his vers þer was a cok
 ffor a preestes sone ȝaue hym a knok
Vpon his legge whiles he was ȝonge and nyce
He made hym forto lese his benefice
But certeyn þer nys noon comparison
Bytwix þe wisdom and discrecion
  
Of ȝoure fadere and of his subtilite
Now syngeþ sir for seint charite
Lat see conne ȝe ȝoure fadere countrefete
This Chauntelere his wenges gan to bete
As man þat coude nat his treson aspie
So was he rauessed wiþ his flaterye
Allas ȝe lordes mony a fals flatour
Is in ȝour court and mony a losengour
That plesen ȝou more by my feiþ
That he þat soþfastnesse vnto ȝou seiþ
Redeþ Ecclesiastre of flaterye
Beþ ware ȝe lordes of her trecherye
This Chaunteclere stood high vpon his toos
Strecchinge his nek and held his eien cloos
And gan to crowe loude for þe nones
And daun Russel stert vp al at ones
And by þe Gargaige hent Chaunteclere
And on his bak toward the wood hym bere
ffor ȝit was ther no man hym swed
O Destany þat maist not bene eschewed
Allas þat chaunteclere fel fro þe bemes
Allas his wif ne rouȝt not of dremes
And on a friday felle all þis meschāunce
O Venus þat art goddes of plesaunce
Siþens þat þi seruaunte was þis chaunteclere
And in þi seruise did al his powere
More for delit þan þe world to multiplie
Whi woldest þou suffre on þi day to dye  
O Gaufrede dere maistere souereyn
Þat whan þe worþi kinge Richard was sclayn
Wiþ shot compleyndest his deþ so sore
Whi ne had I nowe þi sentence and þi lore
Þe ffriday forto chide as did ȝe
ffor on a friday shortely sclayne was he
Þan wolde I shewe howe þat I coude playne
ffor chaunteclere and for his peyne
  
Certus such crye ne lamentacion
was of ladies made whan þat Ilyon
Was wonne and pirrus with his streiȝt swerd
Whan he hent king Prian by þe beerd
And sclayn hym as seide Enneidos
As maden all þe hennes in þe cloos
Whan þei had seie of chaunteclere þe siȝt
But souereyn dame pertelote shriȝt
wel lodder þan did Hasdrubaldes wif
whan þat her husbonde had lost his lif
And þat þe romaynes had brent Cartage
She was so ful of torment and of Rage
That wilfully into þe fire she stert
And brent her self wiþ a stedfast hert
O wooful hennys riȝt so criden ȝe
As whan þat Nero brent þe Cite
Of Rome criden þe Cenatours wyues
ffor þat her husbondes shulden lese her lyues
wiþouten Gilt  Nero haþ hem sclayn
Now wil I turne to my tale aȝein
This sely widowe and hure douȝters two
Herden þe hennys crien and make woo
And out atte door sterten þei anoon
And segh þe fox toward þe groue goon
And bare on his bak þe Cok away
They criden out and harawe and welaway
A ha þe fox and after hym þei ran
And eke wiþ staues mony an oþer man
Ran Coll our dogge talbot and Garlonde
And Malkyn wiþ her dystaf in hure honde  
Ran cowe and calf and eke the verrey hogges
Sore afferd for berking of dogges
And shetinge of men and wommen eke
þei ronne so þeire hertes þei þouȝt to breke
þei ȝelden as feendes don in helle
The dogges criden as men wold hem quelle
  
Out of the hyues come þe swarme of bees
The gees for fere flowen in þe trees
So hidous was the noise O benedicite
Certes he Iak strawe and his mayne
Ne made neuer showtes half so shrille
whan þat þei wolde eny flemmyng kille
As þat ilk day was made vpon þe fox
Of bras þei brouȝt bemes and of box
Of horn and boon in which þei pouped
And þerwiþal þei schrited and showted
It semed as þat heuene shulde falle
Now good I prey ȝou harkeneþ alle
Lo how fortune turneþ sodeynly
The hope and eke pride of her envie
This cok þat lay vppon the fox bak
In al his drede vnto þe fox spak
And saide Sire if I were as ȝe
Ȝit shuld I say as wis god helpe me
Turne aȝeine ȝe proude cherles alle
A verrey pestilence vppon ȝou falle
Nowe am I come vnto þis wodys side
Maugre ȝoure hede þe cok shal here abide
I wol hym ete in feiþ and þat anon
The fox answerde in faiþ it shal be don
And  he spak þat worde al sodeynly
This Cok brak from his mouþ delyuerly
And high vppon a tree he flegh anon
And whan þe fox segh þat he was gon
Allas quod he O chauntelere allas
I haue quod he done to ȝou trespas
In as moch as I made ȝou aferd
Whan I ȝou hent and brouȝt out of þe ȝerde  
But sire I did it not in no wicked entent
Commeþ doune and I shal telle ȝou what I ment
I shal saie soþ god helpe me soo
Nay þan quod he I schrewe vs boþ twoo
  
And first I schrewe my self boþ blood and bones
Ȝif þou bigile me ofter þan ones
Thow shalt no more wiþ þi flaterie
Do me swynk and wink wiþ myn ye
ffor he þat wynket whan he shuld see
As wisly god lat hym neuer þee
Nay quod þe fox god ȝeue hym meschaunce
That is so vndiscrete of gouernaunce
That Iangeleþ whan he shuld haue pees
Loo such is forto be rechelees
And necligent and trusteþ on flaterie
But ȝe þat holden þis foly
As of a Cok of a fox and of an henne
Takeþ þe Moralite good men·
ffor seint poule seiþ al þat writen is
To our doctrine it is writen ywis 
Takeþ þe fruyte and lat þe chaf be stille
Nowe good god if it be þi wille
As seiþ my lorde so make vs all good men
And bringe vs al to his blisse Amen
WEte ȝe not where stont a litel toune
Which þat is cleped bob vp and doune
Vnder þe blee in Caunterbery waye
Ther gan our hooste to Iape and playe
And saide Sirres donne is in þe myre
Is þer no man for preiere ne for hyre
That wil awake our felawe behinde
A theef myȝt hym robbe and bynde
Se howe he nappeþ for goddys bones
Awaite he wil falle from his hors at ones
This is a coke of london wiþ meschaunce
Do hym come forþ he knoweþ his penaunce  
ffor he shal telle a tale be my fay
Al þouȝe it be nat worth a botel of hay
Awake þou coke god ȝeue þe Sorowe
What aileþ þe to slepe so by þe morowe
Hast þou had fleen to nyȝt or þou art dronke
Or hast þou al nyȝt wiþ som quene yswonke
So þat þou maist not holde vp þine hede
This Coke þat was  pale and no þing rede
Saide to oure hooste so god me blesse
As þer is holden on me such heuynesse
That I not wheder me were leuer sclepe
Than þe best Galon wyne in chepe
  
wel quod þe manciple it wil done ese
To þe Sir Coke and to no wiȝt mysplese
whiche þat riden in þis company
þat soo our hoost wil of his curtesy
I wil as nowe excuse þe of þi tale
ffor in good fay þi visage is riȝt pale
þine eyen dasen as me þenkeþ
And wel I woot þi breth sore stynkeþ
That sheweþ þou nart not wel disposed
Of me certaine þou shalt not bene glosed
See howe he goleth þis dronken wiȝt
As þowe he wolde swoune anon riȝt
Hold cloos þi mouþe man by þi fader kyn
The deuel of helle sette his foote þerIn
Thy cursed breeth wil affecte vs alle
ffy stynkinge hogge foule mot þe byfalle
Now takeþ hede sirs of þis lusty man
Now swete sir wil ye Iust at þe fan
Therto me þenkeþ ȝe be wel yshape
 I trowe ȝe han dronken wyne grape
And þat is whan men pley with a strawe
And wiþ þis speche þe coke wex al wrawe

ffor lak of speche and downe the hors hym cast
Where as he lay til that men hym vptoke
This was a faire cheuache of a cooke
Allas that he nad hold hym bi his ladill
And or that he ageyn were in his sadill  
Ther was grete schovuyng to and froo
To lift hym up and mykel care and woo
So vnweldy was þis appalled goost
And to þe manciple þan speke our hoost  
By cause drink haþ Dominacion
Vppon þis man by my sauacion
I trowe he wolde lewdely telle his tale
ffor were it wyne or ellis moyst ale
  
That he haþ dronken he spekeþ in his nose
And galpeþ fast and eke he haþ þe pose
He haþ also to doo more þan ynogh
To kepe hym and his capel out of þe sclouȝgh
And if he falle fro his capel eft sone
Than shal we alle haue ynogh to done
In liftinge vp of his heuy corps
Telle on þi tale of hym make I no force
But nowe Maunciple in feiþ þou art to nyce
Thus openly to repreue hym of his vice
Anoþer day he wil perauenture
Recleyme þe and bringe þe to lure
I mene he speke wold of smale þingges
As forto pynchen at þi rekenyngges
That were not honest ȝif it come to preef
Nowe quod the maunciple þat were a gret mescheef
So myȝt he bringe me in þe snare
Ȝit had I leuer paien for þe mare
Which he rit vpon þan he shuld with me strive
I wil not wreþ hym as mot I þrive
what þat I spak I saide it in my bourde
And wote ȝe what I haue here in a gourde
A drauȝt of wyne ȝe of a ripe grape
And riȝt anoon ȝe shul se a good Iape
This Coke shal drynk þerof ȝif þat I may
Vp peyne of deþ he wil nat say me nay
And certeynly to tellen as it was
Of þis vessel þe Coke dronk fast alas
What nedeþ hit he dronk ynouȝe toforn
And whan he had poped in his horn
To þe Manciple he toke þe gourde ageyn
And of þat drinke þe Coke was wonder feyn
And þonked hym in such wise as he coude
Than gan oure hoost to laughen wondere loude  
And saide I see wel it is necessarie
Where þat we goon good drink wiþ vs to carie
  
ffor þat wil turne rancour and dissese
To pees and loue and mony a wronge to sese
O Bachus blessed be þi name
That so can turne ernest into game
Worship and þonk be vnto þe
ffor of þis matere ȝe gete no more of me
Telle on þou manciple I þe pray
Wel sir quod he now herkeneþ what I say
WHan Phebus dwelt here in þis erþe adoun
As olde bokes maken mencioun
He was þe most lusty bachilere
Of al þis world and eke þe best archere
He sclough Phiton þe serpent as he lay
Scleping aȝeinst þe sonne vpon a day
And mony a noþer worþi noble dede
He wiþ his bowe wrouȝt as men may rede
Pleien he coude on euery mynstralcie
And syngen þat it was a melodye
To harken of his cleere voys þe soun
Certes þe kynge of Thebes Amphioun
That wiþ hys syngging walled þat cite
Coude neuere synge half so wel as he
Therto he was þe semeliest man
That is or was siþ þe world bygan
What nedeþ it is fetures to discrive
ffor in þis world was noon so faire alyue
He was þerwith fulfilled of gentilnesse
Of honure and of parfit worþinesse
This Phebus þat was flour of bachelerie
As wel in fredom as in Chiualrie
ffor disport and in signe eke of victorie
Of Pheton so as telleþ vs þe storie
was wont to beren in his honde a bowe
Now haþ þis Phebus in his hows a crowe  
Which in a Cage he fostred mony a day
And tauȝt it to speke as men doon a Iaye
  
White was þis crowe as is a white swan
And countrefeted þe speche of euery man
He cowde whan he shuld telle a tale
Therwiþ in al þis londe þer nys no nyȝtyngale
That cowde by an hundred thousan dele
Synge so mery and eke so wel
Now had þis phebus in his hous a wif
Which þat he loued more þan his owne lif
And nyght and day did euer diligence
Her for to plese and done reuerence
Sauf oonly ȝif I þe soþ shal sayn
Ialous he was and wold haue kept hure fayn
ffor hym were loþe Iiaped forto be
And so euery man wold in such degre
But al for nauȝt for it availeþ noȝt
A good wif þat is clene of werk and þoȝt
Shuld not be kepte in noon awaite certeyn
And trewly þe labour is in veyn
To kepe a schrewe for it wil not be
This hold I for a verrey nycete
To spille labour forto kepe wyues
Thus writen olde clerkes in her lyues
But nowe to purpos as I first bygan ·
This worþi phebus dooþ al þat he can
To plesen hure wenyng by such plesaunce
And for his manhode and his gouernaunce
That no man shuld haue put hym from hir grace
But god it wote þer may no man enbrace
As to destroie a þinge which þat nature
Haþ naturelly sette in a creature
Take eny bridde and put it in a cage
And doo al þine entent and þi corage
To fostere it tenderly wiþ mete and drink
Of alle deyntise þat þou canst byþenk
And kepe it also clenly as he may
Al þouȝe his Cage of gold be neuer so gay    
Ȝit haþ þis brid by twenty þousand fold
Leuer in a forest þat is wilde and cold
Goon ete wormes and suche wrecchednesse
ffor euer þis bridde wol doon his bysynes
To escape out of his cage if he may
His liberte þe bridde desireþ ay
Lat take a cat and fostre hym wel with mylk
And tendere flesshe and make his couche of silk
And lat hym seen a mous goo by þe wall
And anoon he wayueth mylk flessh and all
And euery deynte þat is in þe hous
Suche appetit haþ he to ete a mous
Lo here haþ lust his domynaciōn
And appetit flemeþ discreciōn
As þe wolf haþ also a vileyns kynde
The lewdest wolf þat she may fynde
Or leest of reputacion þat wil she take
In tyme whan hur lust to haue a make
Alle þise ensamples speke I by þise men
That bene vntrewe and no þing by wommen
ffor men han euer a likerous appetit
On lower þing to performe her delite
Than on her wyues bene þei neuere so faire
Ne neuere so trewe ne so debonaire
fflesshe is so newefongel wiþ meschaunce
That we ne konne no þinge han plesaunce
That sowneþ in vertue eny while
This Phebus which þat þouȝt vpon no gile
Deceyued was for al his Iolite
ffor vnder hym anoþer had she
A man of litel reputaciōn
Not worþ to phebus in comparison
The more harme is it happeþ oft soo
Of whoch þer commeth mochel harme and woo
And so byfelle whan phebus was absent
His wif anoon haþ for her lemman sent
  
Here lemman certes þis is a knauyssh speche
fforȝeueþ it me and þat I ȝou biseche  
The wise Plato seiþ as ȝe may rede
þe Word mot nedes accorde wiþ þe dede
Ȝif men shal telle proprely a þinge
The worde mot Cosyn be to þe workinge
I am a boistous man riȝt þus say I
Ther nys no difference trewly
Bitwix a wif þat is of hie degre
Ȝif of her body dishonest she be
And a poor wenche oþer þan þis
Ȝif it so be þei wirk boþ amys
But þat þe gentile is in state aboue
She shal be cleped his lady as in loue
And for þat oþer is a poor womman
She shal be cleped his wench and his lemman
And god it woote myn owne der broþer
Men sayn þat oon lith as lowe as doþ þat oþer
Riȝt so bitwix a titles tyraunt
And an houlaw and a þeef erraunt
The same I say þer nys no difference
To Alisaunder was tolde þat sentence
That for þe tyraunt is of gretere myȝt
By force of mayne for sclen doun riȝt
And brennen hous and home and make al playn
Lo þerfore is cleped a Capitayn
And for þe outlaw haþ but smal mayne
And may not doon so grete an harme as he
Ne bringe a contre to so grete meschief
Men clepen hym an outlay or a þeef
But sor I am a man not text wel
I wil not telle of Titus neuer a dele
I wil go to my tale as I byganne
Whan phebus  had sent for her lemman
Anoon þei wrouȝten al her lust volage
This white crowe þat henge ay in þe cage
  
Bihelde her werk and saide neuer a word
And whan þat home was come Phebus þe lord
þis crowe songe Cokkow cokkow Cukkowe
What brid quod phebus what songe singest thowe  
Ne were þou wonte so merely to synge
That to myn hert it was a reioysinge
To here þi vois allas what songe is þis
By god quod he I synge nat a mys
Phebus quod he for al þi worþinesse
ffor al þi bewte and þi gentilnesse
ffor al þi songe and al þi mynstralcye
ffor al þi waytinge blered is þine ye
Wiþ oon of litel reputaciōn
Nouȝt worþ to þe as in comparison
The mountaunce of a gnatte so mote I thryue
ffor on þi bed þi wiff I segh hym swyve
What wil ȝe more þe crawe anoon hym tolde
By sad tokens and by wordes bolde
How þat his wif had doon her leccherie
Hym to grete shame and to gret vilenye
And tolde hym oft he segh it wiþ his eyen
This Phebus gan awaiward forto wryen
Hym þouȝt his sorowful hert brast atwoo
His bowe he bent and sette þerInne a floe
And in his Ire haþ he his wif sclayn
This is þeffecte þer nys no more to sayn
ffor sorowe of which he brak his mynstralcie
Boþ harpe and lute gitern · and sawtrie
And eke he brak his harowes and his bowe
And after þat þus speke he to þe crowe
Traitour quod he wiþ tunge of scorpion
Thou hast me brouȝt to my confusion
Allas þat I was wrouȝt why ner I dede
O dere wiff o gemme of lustihede

Now liest þou dede wiþ face pale of hwe
  
fful giltles þat durst I swere ywis
O Rakel hounde to doon so foule amys
O trouble witte o yre rechelees
That vnavised smytest giltlees
O wantrest ful of fals suspeciōn
Wher was þi witt and þi discrecion  
O euery man be war of rechelesnesse
Ne trow no þinge wiþout strong witnesse
Smyte not to sone er þow wit why
And be avised wel and soberly
Er ȝe doon eny executiōn
Vppon ȝoure Ire for suspeciōn
Allas an Ml folk han rakel yre

Allas for sorowe I wil my self scle
And to þe Crawe o· fals þeef saide he

Thow songe whilom like a nyȝtyngale
Now shalt þou fals þeef þi songe forgone
Eke þi white fetheres euerechone
Ne neuer in al þi lif shalt þou speke
Thus shal men on a traitour ben ywreke
Thowe and þine ospringe euer shul be blake
Ne neuer swete noys shul ȝe make
But euer crie aȝeinst tempest and reyne
In tokenynge þat þorgh þe my wif is scleyn
And to þe crowe he stert and þat anone
And pulled his white feþeres euerechone
And made hym blak and raft hym al his songe
And eke his speche and out atte dore hym sclonge
Vnto þe deuel to whoom I hym bitake
And for þis caus bene al crowes blake
Lordyngges by þis ensample I ȝou preie
 Beþ war and takeþ kepe what þat ȝe seie
Ne telleþ neuer no man ȝoure liff
How þat anoþer man haþ diȝt þi wiff
  
He wil ȝou hate mortelly certayn
Dann salomon as wise clerkes sayn
Techeþ a man to kepe his tunge wel
But as I seide I am not text wel
But naþelees þus tauȝt me my dame
My sone þenk on þe crowe a goddys name
My sone kepe wel þi tunge and kepe þi frende
A wicked tunge is wors þan a feende  
My sone from a feende men may hem blisse
My sone god of hise endelees goodnesse
Walled a tunge wiþ teeþ and lippes eke
ffor man shuld hym avise what he speke
My sone ful oft for to mochel speche
Haþ mony a man be spilt as clerkes teche
But for litel speche avisely
Is no man shent to speke generally
My sone þi tunge shuldest þou restreyn
Att al tyme but whan þou dost þi peyn
To speke of god in honure and preiere
The furst vertue sone ȝif þou wilt lere
Is to restreyne and kepe wel þi tonge
Thus lernen children whan þei bene ȝonge

Comeþ moche harme þus was me told and tauȝt
In mochel speche synne wanteþ nauȝt

My sone be war and be not autour newe
Of tydingges whedere þei be fals or trewe
Where so þou come amonges hie or lowe
Kepe wel þi tunge and þenk vpon þe crowe
BY þat þe manciple had his tale ended

So lowe þat he was nauȝt to my siȝt

I wil ful fayne at cristes reuerence
Doon ȝou plesaunce leeful as I can
But trusteþ wel I am a soþeren man
I can not gest rum ram ruf by letter
Ne god woote Ryme hold I but lite better
And þerfore if ȝou lust I nyl nat glose
I wil ȝou telle a mery tale in prose
To knytte vp al þis feest and make an ende
And Ihesu for his grace wit me sende
To schew ȝou þe way in þis viage
Of þilk parfite glorious pilgrimage
That hight Ierusalem celestiall
And if ȝe vouchesauf anon ȝe shall
Bygynne vpon my tale for which I prey
Telle ȝour avis I can no better seye
But naþelees þis meditaciōn
I putt aye vnder correccion
Of clerkes for I am not textwell
I take but þe sentence trusteþ well
Therfore I make protestacion
That I wil stonde to correccion
  
Vpon þis woord we han assented sone
ffor as it semed it was forto done
To enden in som vertuous sentence
And forto ȝeue hym space and audience
And bad our hoost he shulde to hym seie

Our hoost had þe wordes for vs alle
Sir preest quod he now faire mot ȝou byfalle
Say what ȝou lust and we shullen gladly here
And wiþ þat word he saide in þis manere  
Telleþ quod he ȝoure meditacioun
But hasteþ ȝou þe sonne wil adoun
Beeþ fructuous and þat in litel space
And to do wel god sende ȝou his grace
 Sire Nonnes preest oure hoost seyde a none
yblessed be thy breth and euery stoone
This was a mery tale of Chaunteclere
But be my trouthe if thou were seculere
Thow woldeste bene a tredefoul a right
ffor if thow haue corage as thou haste myght
The were nede of hennes as I wene
Ye moo than vij tymes seventene
See whiche braunnes hath this gentel preeste
So grete a nekke and so large a breeste
He loketh as a Sparhauke with his yen
Hym nedeth nat his colour for to dyen  
with Brasile ne with Greyne of Portyngale 
Now sire faire falle yow for youre tale
And aftir he with full mery chere
Saide vnto a nother as ye shulle here

He loked as he were a wilde bore
And grynt with the teth  so was he wroth
A sturdy pas  doun to the court he goth
Wher that ther woned  a man of grete honour
To whom that he  was alway confessour
This worthy man  was lorde of that vyllage
This ffrere cam  as he were in a rage Sompnour  
Wher as the lorde  sat etyng at his borde
Vneth myht the frere  speke a worde
  
Til at last  he seid god you see
This lorde gan look  and sayd benedicite
What ffrere Iohn  what maner worlde is this
I see weel  that som thing is amys
Ye looke  as the woode wer ful of thevys
Sit doun anoon  and telle me what you grevis
And it shall ben amendid  yf y may
I haue quod he  had a foul despyt this day
God yelde it you  adoun in your village
That in this worlde  ther nys so pore a pape
That he nolde haue  abhomynacioun
Of that y haue  receyved  in the toun
And yit ne grevith it me also sore
As that the olde chirle  with lokkis hoore
Blasfemed hath  our holy covent eek
Nowe maister quod this lorde  y you beseeche
No maister quod he  but a servitour
Thouh y haue had in scole  that honour
God lyketh nat  that raby men vs calle
Nothir in Markat  ne in your large halle
No force quod he  but telle me all your greeff
Sir quod this ffrere  an odious myschieff
This day betid is  myn ordre and me
And so par consequens  in eche degre
Of holy chirch  god amende it sone
Sir quod the lorde  ye wot what is to done
Distempir you nat  ye be my confessour

ffor goddis love  your pacient now holde  
Tell me your greef  and anon he him tolde
As ye haue herd beforne  ye wot well what
The lady of the hous  ay still sat
Tyl she hadde harde  all what the ffrere said
By goddis modir quod she  the blisful mayd
Is ther auht ellis  telle me feithfully

Madame quod he  bi god y shall not lye
But yf y  be any weyes may be wreke
I shall diffame him  ovirall wher y speke
The fals blasphemour  that chargid me
To depart  that wol not departed be
To euerych man  alych with myschaunce
The lord sat styll  as he wore in a traunce
And in his hert  he rolleth vp and doun
How that this cherle  had ymaginacioun
To shewe such a probleme  to the ffrere
Nevir est er nowe  her y of such matere
I trow the devill  put it in his mynde
In ars  shall no man  metryk fynde
Byforn this day  of such a questioun
Who sholde make  a demonstracioun
That euery man  shulde haue lyk his part
As of soun  or of savour  of a fart
O nyce prowde chirll  y shrew his face
Loo sirs quod the lorde  what harde grace
To euery man lyk  telle me howe Sompnour  
That a fart  sholde be departed nowe
It is an Impossible  it may nat be
Ey nyce cherl  god lat him nevir the
The romblyng  of a fart  and euery soun
Nys but of heyr  reuerberacioun
And ther it wasteth  lytel and lytel awey
Ther is no man  can deme bi my fey
Yf that it were  departed equally
What lo my cherle  lo howe shrewdely
Vnto my confessour  to day he spak
I holde him certayn  a demonyak
  
Now ete your mete  and lat the chirle go play
Lat him go hang him self  a devylway
Now stood the lordis Sqwyer  atte boorde
That karf his mete  and herd woorde bi woorde
Of all thing  whiche y haue said
My lorde quod he  be ye nat evill apayde
I cowde telle  for a gowne cloth
To you sir frere  so ye be nat wroth
How that a ffart  shall evene delt be
Among your covent  yif it lyke the
Tell quod the lorde  and thou shalt haue anon

But loke that it haue  his spokys holis all

And bryng me xij ffrerys  wyte ye why

Thanne shall ye knele adoun  bi oon assent
And to euery spokis ende  in this maneer
ffull sadly ley in his nose  shall a ffrere
your noble confessour  god him save
Shall holde his nose vpriht  vndir the nave
Thanne shall this chirl  with bely styf and touht
As any tabur  hidir be brouht
And set him on the wheel  ryht of this carte
Vpon the nave  and make him let a fart
And ye shall seyn  vp pereil of my lyf
By preeff  whiche is demonstratyf
  
That equally  the soun of it wol wende
And eek the stynk  vnto the spokys eende
Sauf that this worthi man your confessour
Bicause he is a man  of gret honour
Shal haue the first frute  as resoun is
The noble vsage of ffreris  it is this
The worthiest man of hem al  shall ferst be served
And certeynly  he hath it wel deserued
He hath to day tauht vs  so moch good
Wyth preching in the pulpet  ther he stood
That y may vouchesauf  y say for me
He hadde the first smell  of ffartis thre
And so woll all thys covent hardely
He berith him so fair  and so hoolyly
The lord  the lady  and ech man sauf the ffrere
Said that Iaynkyn  spake in his mateere
As well as Euclido  or Partholome
Touchyng the Cherlis  thei seiden  subtilte
And bi witt  made him speke as he spake
He is no fool  nor no domynyak Sompnour  
And Iaynkyn  hath wonne a new gowne
My tale is don  we be almost at towne
WEpyng and weylyng  care and othir sorwe

Betwene Grisildes  grete pacience
And of my wyf  the passing cruelte

Assay who wyll  and he shall fynde
That y sey soth  be seynt Thomas of ynde

And yit y trowe  that he that all his lyf

Gladly quod he  but of myn owne sore
