WHan þat Aprille wyþe his schoures soote

And baþes euery veyne in suche lycoure
Of whiche vertue engender is þe floure

An schortly whan þe son was to reste
So had I spoken with hem euerychone

And euere honoured for his worþinesse

His hors was goode bot he was nouhte gaye
Off ffustion he werede a Gepon
All besmoterde wiþ his haburgen

And went for to done his Pilgrimage
Wiþ hime þare was his sonne a ȝonge swiere
A louyer and a lusti bachellere
Wiþ lokkes crulle as þei were leide in presse
Of xx ȝeres of age he was I gesse
Of his stature he was of euen lengeþe
And wonderly deliuer and grete of strenkeþe
And he had be sume time in cheualrie  
In fflandres in Artoys and in Pykardie
And borne him wele as of so litel space

So hote he loued þat be nyghter tale

And he was cladde in cote and hoode of grene
A scheef of pokoke arwes briht and kene

Of wodecraft wele couþe he al þe vsage
Vpon his arme he bare a gaie brasere
And be his side a swerde and a bokelere
And on þat oþere side a gaie daggere

And whanne he rode men myht his bridele here

And I seide his opinione was goode
Whatt scholde he stodie and make him selfe wode
Vpon a boke in cloister alweie to powre

As Austine bite howe schal þe werld be serued
Latte Austine haue his swynke to him reseued
Tharefor he was a prikasoure a right
Grehoundes he had as swift as foules in flyht
Of Prikinge and of huntynge for þe hare
Was al his lust for no cost wolde he spare
I seighe his sleues purfiled att þe honde
Wiþ Gryse and þat þe fynest of a londe
And for to festen þe hode vnder his chynne

So muche of daliance and faire langage

Of ȝonge wemmen att his owen cost
Vnto his order he was a nobel post

With frankeleyns ouer al in his contre

And certeinli he had a mery note
Wele couþe he singen and pleine on a rote
Of ȝeddinges he bare witterli þe pris

So plesande was his in principio
Ȝit wolde he haue a ferþinge ar he wente

And rage he couþe riht as it were a whelpe
In louedaies þare couþe he muchel helpe

Wiþ a þredebare cope as a pouer scolere
Bot he was lyke a Maistre or a Pope
Of dowble worstede was his semycope

Somwhat he lisped for his wantonesse
To make his yngelische swete vpon his tonge
And in his harpeinge whan he had songe

Wiþ his Bargeynes and wiþ his cheuisance

Of fees and robes had he manyone
So grete a purchasour was nowhere none
Al was fe symple to him in effecte

Of ffissche of flessche and þat so plentiuouse

Be his clennes how his schepe scholde liue

And Ran to Londen vnto seint poules
To seke him a chauntery to singe for sowles
Or wiþ a breþerhede to be wiþholde

And þouhe he holy were and vertuous

Att al times þouhe he gamed or smerte
And þan his neighebore riht as him selue

With owte hire if it leie in his miht
His tyþes paide he ful faire and wele
Bothe of his proper swynke and of his catel
In a tabarde he rode vpon a mere
 Ther was al so a reue and a Mellere
A sompnour and pardonere al so

The Meller was a stowte carle for þe nones
fful big he was of braune and eke of bones 
That proued wele for ouer al þer he cam  
Att wrastelinge he wolde haue awaie þe ramme

There was no dore þat he ne wolde heue of harre
Or breke it wiþ a renynge with his hede
His berd as any sowe or fox was rede
And þerto brode as þouhe it were a spade
Vpon þe cop riht of his nose he had
A werte and þere on stode a tofte of heres
Rede as þe bresteles of a sowes Eres

And þat was most of sinne and of Harlotries
Wele couþe he stele corne and tolle þries
And ȝitte he had a thombe of golde parde
A white cote and a blewe hode wered he
A Baggepipe wele couþe he blawe and sowne


And þere wiþ all he browht vs owte of towne
A gentill Maunciple was þere of a temple
Of whiche acatours miht take goode ensample

Algate he waited so in his achate
Þat he was al beforne and in goode astate
Now es nouht þat of god a ful faire grace
Þat suche a lewde mannes witt schal pace
Þe wisdom of an hepe of lerned men
Of Maistres had he mo þan þries ten
Þat weren of lawe expert and curious
Of wiche þer was a doseine in þat hous
Worþe to be stewardes of rent and londe
Of any lordes þat is in yngelonde
To make him leue be his propre goode
In honoure detteles bot if he were wode
Or lyue as scarsely as him lust desire
And able for to helpen al a schire
In any cas þat myht fal or happe
And ȝit þis manciple sette here alþere cappe
 The reue was a sclender Colerik man
His berde was schaue as nyhe as euere he can
His here was be his eres rounde yschorne  
His tope was dokked like a preste to forne

Ilike a staf þar was no calfe ysene
Wele couþe he kepe a gernar or a bynne
Ther was non auditoure couþe on him wynne
Wele wiste he be drowhte and be þe reyne
The ȝeldeynge of his sede and of his greyne
His lordes schepe his nete his dayre
His swyne his hors his store and his pultre
Was holy in þis reues gouernynge
And be his couenant ȝaf þe rekenynge
Sen þat his lord was twenty ȝere of age


Þare couþe no man bringe him in arerage
Thare nas Baillif ne herde ne oþere hyne
That he ne knewe his sleyht and his Couyne
Thei were adrad of him as of þe deþe
His wonynge was ful faire vpon an heþe
Wiþ grene trees schadowed was his place
He couþe better þan his lorde purchace
fful riche he was astored priuely
His lord he couþe wele plese subtily
To ȝiue and lenne him of his owen goode
And haue a þonke and ȝit a cote and an hoode
In ȝowþe he had lerned a good mistere
He was a wel goode wriht a carpentere
This satt vpon a fol goode stot
That was a pomely greye and hihte Scot
A longe surcote of peers vpon he hadde
And be his side he bare a rusti blade
Of Norþefolk was þis reue whiche I tell
Besiden a towne men clepen it baldeswell
Tukked he was as is a frere abowte
And euere he rode hinderest of owre Rowte
 A Somynour was þer wiþ vs in þat place
Þat had a firy Cherubynnes face
ffor sausefleme he was with yhen narowe
Als hote he was and licherous as a sparowe
Wiþ scalled browes blake and a pilled berde
Of his vesage childerne were aferde
Ther nas whikesiluer litarge or bremstone
Boras orsure ne oyle of tartre none
Ne oyment þat wolde clense and bite  
That him myht helpe of his whelkes white
Nere of þe knobbes sittinge in his chekes
Wele loued he garlike onyons and ȝite lekes
And for to drinke stronge wyne rede as blode
Than wold he speke and crie as he ware wode
And whan þat he wele drongen had þe wyne


þan wold he speke no worde bot latyne
A fewe terems had he two or thre
That he had lerned owte of sum decre
No wonder is he herd it al þe daie
And eke ȝe knowen it wele howe þat a Iaie
Kan clepe watt as wele as kan þe pope
Bot who so couþe in oþer þinge him grope
Þan had he spent al his philosophie
Ay Questio quid Iuris wold he crie
He was a gentil harlot and a kynde
A better felawe scholde men nouht finde
He wolde suffer for a whart of wyne
A good felaw to haue his concubyne
A twelmouþe and excuse him att fulle
And priuely eke a finche couþe he pulle
And if he fonde owhere a goode felawe
He wolde techen him to haue none awe
In suche cas of þe Archedekenes Curse
Bot if  mannes soule were in his purse
ffor in his purs he scholde punyschede be
The purse es þe Archedekenes hell seide he
Bot wele I wote he lyede riht in dede
Of curssinge owht yche gilty man him drede
ffor curs wil sle riht as asoyleynge sauyþe
And also war him of a significauit
In dawngere had he att his owen gise
The ȝonge girles of þe diocise
And knewe her consel and what was al here rede
A garland had he sett vpon his hede
As grete as it were for an Alestake
A bokelere had he made him of a kake
 Wiþe him þere rode a gentil pardonere
Of Rouncyual his frende and his comper
þat streyhte was comme fro þe courte of Rome
fful loude he songe come hider loue to me
This Somenoure bare to him a stif burdoune  

Was neuer trompe of halfe so grete a soune
This pardonere had here as ȝalowe as wax
Bot smothe it henge as doþ a strike of flax
Bi ounces henge his lokkes þat he hadde
And þer wiþ he his scholdres ouer spradde
But þinne it leie be culpones one and one
But hode for Iolyte wered he none
ffor it was trussed vp in his walet
Him þouht he rode al of þe newe get
Discheuele saue his cape he rode al bare
Suche glayringe yhen had he as it were an hare
A vernicle had he sewe vpon his cape
His walet  to forne him in his lappe
Bret ful of pardon comen from Rome al hote
A voyce he had also smale as it were a gote
No berde had he ne neuer schuld haue
As smoþe it was as it were late schaue
I trowe he were a geldinge or a mare
Bot of his craft fro Berwike in to ware
Ne was þere suche anoþer pardonere
ffor in his male he hadde a pylowbere
Whiche that he seide was owre lady veyle
He seide he had a gobet of þe seile
That seint Peter had whan þat he wente
Vpon þe see till ihesu crist him hente
He had a croyce of Laton ful of stones
And in a glasse he hadde Pygges bones
Bot wiþe þes relikes whan þat he fonde
A pouer person dwellynge vpon londe
Vppon a daie he gat him more moneye
Than þat þe person gatte in þe Monethes tweye
And þus wiþ feyned flaterynge and Iapes
He Maade þe persone and þe peple his Apes
Bot trewly to tellen att þe laste
He was in þe cherche a noble ecclesiaste
Wele couþe he rede a lesson or a story


Bot alþer best he songe a offertory
fful wele he wist whan þat songe was songe
He moste preche and wele affile his tonge
To wynne siluer as he wele cowde
Þerefore he songe so merely and loude
 Nowe haue I tolde ȝowe soþely in a clause  
The estate þe arraye þe Nombre and eke þe cause
Whi þat assembled was þis companye
In Suthewerke att þis gentil Hosterie

Bot nowe is time to ȝowe for to telle
Howe þat we beren vs þat ilke nyhte
Whan we were in þat Osterye alyhte
And after wil I tell of owre viage
And al þe remenant of owre pilgrenage
Bot first I preye ȝowe of ȝoure curtesie
That ȝe ne ret it nowht my velenye
Thoughe þat I pleinly speke in þis matier
To telle ȝowe her wordes and eke her chere
Ne þouhe I speke here wordes propurly
ffor þis ȝe knowen as wele as I
Who so sal tellen a tale after a mān
He mote reherce as nyhe as euer he cān
Eueryche a worde if it be in his charge
Al speke he neuer so rudeli and so large
Or elles he most tel his tale vntrewe
Or feyne þinges or fynde wordes Newe
He may nouht spare alþouhe he ware his broþer
He mot also wele seie o worde as another
Criste spak him self ful brode in holy writte
And wele ȝe wote no velany is itte
Eke plato seiþe who so kan him rede
The wordes most be Cosin to þe dede
 Also I preie ȝowe forȝif it me
Al haue I not sett folke in her degre
Here in þis tale as þat þei scholde stonde

Grete chere maade owre oste vs euerychone
And to þe soper sett he vs anone

Stronge was þe wyne and wele drinke vs leste
A semely man owre ost was wiþ all

A large man he was wiþ eyȝen stepe
A fairer burgeis is none none in chepe
Bolde of his speche and wyse and wele ytawht
And of manhode him lakked riht nouht
Eke þereto he was riht a mery man  
And after soper pleyȝen he began
And spak of Mirþe amonge oþere þinges

And seide þus Now lordeynges trewly
Ȝe bene to me welcome riht hertly

Att ones in þis herburhe as is nowe

And of a merþe I am riht nowe beþouhte

And wele I wote as ȝe gone be þe weye

And if ȝowe likeþ all be on assente

And for to werken as I schal ȝowe seie

And graunted him wiþoute more avise
And bad him seie his verdite as him liste
Lordynges quod he now herkeneþ for þe beste
Bot tak it nowhte I pray ȝowe in disdeyne
This is þe pointe to speke schort and pleine
That iche of ȝowe to schort wiþ owre weie
In þis viage schal tel tales tweye
To Kanterbury warde I mene it so
And homward he schal tellen oþere two
Of aventures whilome þat hane befall
And whiche of ȝowe þat bereþ him best of all
That is to seyne þat telleþ in þis cas
Tales of best sentence and most solas
Schall haue a soper at owre aller cost  
Here in þis place sittinge be þe post
Whan þat we comen ageine fro Canturbury
And for to make ȝow þe more mery

And who so wil my Iuggement wiþseie
Schal paie al þat we spende be þe weie
And if ȝe vouche saue þat it be so

 This þinge was graunted and owre oþes swore
With ful glad hert and praieyng him also

And þat he wolde be owre gouernowre
And of owre tales Iugge and reporture
And sett a soper att a serteine pris
And we wil rewled bene att his deuis
In hihe and in lowhe and þus be one assent

And þervpon þe wyne was fett anone

And gederd vs togeder in a floke
And forþe we reden a litel mor þan pas

And þere owre oste gan his hors areste
And seide lordes herkeneþ if ȝowe leste

And ȝe sire clerke lat be ȝowre schamefastnesse

Of whiche ful bliþe and glad was euery whit
And tellen he most his tale as it was resōn

And whan þis good man sawhe þat it was so

And wiþ þat worde we riden forþe owre weie
And he began wiþ riht a mery chere
His tale anone and seide as ȝe mai here
Whilome was as holde stories tellen vs
There was a Duke
Of Athenes he was lorde and gouernoure
And in his time suche a conqueroure
That gretter was none vndere þe sonne
fful Mony a riche Contre had he wonne
What wiþ wisdome and his Chiualrie
He conquered al þe Regne of ffemynye
That whilom cleped was Scithia
And wedded þe qwene ypolita
An browht hire home wiþe him in to his contre
Wiþ muche glorie and grete solempnite
And eke hire ȝonge sustere Emelye
And þus wiþ victori and melodie
Latt I þis nobul Duc to Athenes ride
And all his hoste in aremes be his side
And certes if it nere to longe to here
I wold haue told fully þe manere
How wonnen was þe Reigne of ffemynye
By Theus and be his Chiualrrye
And of þe grete Bataile for þe nones
Betwixen Athenes and Amaȝones
And how asseged was ypolyta  
The faire hardie quene of Scithia
And of þe fest þat was att hir weddeynge
And of þe tempest at hire home comynge
Bot al þat þinge I mot at nowe forbere
I haue gode wote a large felde to ere
And weike bene þe Oxen in my plouhe
The remenant of þe tale is longe ynouhe

Latt euery felawe tel his tale aboute
And latt see nowe who schal þe soper winne
And þere I laft I wil aȝeine beginne
 This Duc of whome I make mensioune
Whan he was comen almost to þe toune
In all his wele and his most pride
He was ware as he kast his yhe a side
Where þat þere kneled in þe hihe waie
A company of ladyes twey and twaie
Iche after oþer cladde in cloþes blake
Bot suche a crye and suche a woo þei make
That in þis werlde is creature lyueynge

And of þis crie þei nolde neuer stenten
Till þei þe reynes of his bridel henten
What folke bene ȝe þat att myne home comynge
Perturbe so my fest with cryinge
Quod Theus haue ȝe so grete envie
Of myne honour þat þus compleigne and crie
Or who haþ ȝow mysboden or offended
And telleþ me if it maie bene amended
And whi þat ȝe bene cloþed þus in blake
The eldest lady of hem al spake
Whan sche had swowned wiþ a dedely chere
That it was rewþe for to seen and here
 Sche seide lorde to whome ffortune haþ ȝiuen

Nat greueþ vs ȝowre honoure and ȝowre glorie
Bot we beseke ȝowe of socoure and of mercye
And haue merci on owre woo and owre distrisse
Some drope of Pyte þurgh þi gentillisse
Vpon vs wricchede wemmen latt ȝe fall

That sche ne haþe bne a doches or a quene
Nowe bene we Cayteues as it is wele sene
Thonked be fortune and hire false whele  

Thate none astate ensureþ for to bene wele

That starfe att Thebes cursed be þat dai
And alle we þat bene in þis array
And Maken all þis lamentacioune
We losten al oure hosbondes att þat towne
While þat a sege þare abowte laie
And ȝit nowe þe olde Creon weilowaie

ffulfilled of ire and iniquite

To done the dede bodies velanye
Of all oure lordes whiche þat han be slawe
Haþe al þe bodies on an hepe ydrawe
And wil not suffre hem be none assent
Neyþere to be beride neiþer be to brent
Bot makeþ houndes ete hem in despite
And wiþ þat word withoute more respite

Haue on vs wrecched wemmen sum Mercie
And latt owre sorwe sinken in þin herte
 This gentil Duc downe fro his courser sterte
With hert pitous whan he herd hem speke

Whan he sawhe hem so pitee and so mate
That whilome weren of so grete astate
And in his armes he hem al vp hent
And hem comforteþ in ful goode entent
And swore his hoþe as he was trewe knyht
He wolde done so ferforþelie his miht
Vppon þe Tirant Creon hem al wreke


That al þe peple of grece scholde speke
How creon was of Theseus seruede
As he þat had his deþe ful wele deseruede
And riht anone wiþowten more abode
His Baner he displeide and forþe rode
To þebeswarde and al his hoste beside  
No nerre Athenes wolde he go ne ride
Ne take his ese fulli halfe a daie
Bot onward on his waie þat niht he laie
And sent anone ypolita þe queene
And Emely hir ȝonge suster schene
Vn to þe toune of Athenes to dwelle
And forþ he rideþ þer is no more to telle
 The reede Statue of Marce with spere and targe
So schineþ in his whigte baner large
That al þe felde gleteren vp on a doune
And by his baner borne is his pynoune
Of gold ful riche whiche was ybete
The Mynataure whiche þat he wanne in Crete
Thus riht þis Duc þus ride þide þis conqueroure
And in his host of cheuallerie þe floure
Til þat he cam to Thebes and aliht

In pleine Bateile and put þe folke to flyht
And be asseut he wan þe Cite after
And rent adowne boþe wall and sparre and rafter
And to þe ladies he restored aȝeine
The bones of þeire frendes þat were sleyne
To done þe obsequies as was þo þe gise
Bot it were al to longe for to dovise
The grete clamor and þe weymentynge

Of þe bodies and þe grete honoure

Bot schortely to tellen is myne entente
Whan þat þis worþi Duc þis Theseus

Stil in þat felde he toke al nyhte his rest
And dide wiþ al þe Countre riht as him lest
To ransake in þe caas of þe bodies dede

The piloures deden þe besines and Cure
After þe bataile and þe discomfetoure
And so befel þat in þe caas þei founde  
Thorghe girt mony a greuous blody wounde
Two ȝonge knyhtes liggeynge by and by
Boþen in armes samen wrouht ful richely
Of whiche two Arcita hiht þe tone
And þat oþer knyhte hihte Palamone
Not fully whikke ne fulli dede þei were

As þei þat weren of þe blode roial
Of Thebes and of sustren two yborne
Owte of þe caas peloures haþe hem torne
And haue hem caried softe vnto þe tente
Of Theus and he ful sone hem sente
Tho Athenes to dwellen in prisone
Perpetuely hem nold nouht raunson
 And whan þis worþi Duc had þus ydone

Wiþ Laurer Coroned as a conqueroure
And þere he leueþ in joy and in honoure
Terme of his lif what nedeþ wordes moo
And in a toure in Angwysse and in woo
Dwellen þis Palomon and eke Arcite

This passeþ ȝere be ȝere and daie be daie


Til it fel ones in a Morneinge of maie

Than is þe lylye vpo his stalke grene
And fresscher þan þe maie wiþ floures newe

And makeþ it owte of his slepe to sterte
And siþen arise an done may obseruaunce
This Makeþ Emelye to haue remembrance
To done honoure to maie and for to rise

Behinde hire bake a ȝerde longe I gesse
And in þe Gardine att þe sonne vpriste  
Sche walked vpe and downe and as hir liste
Sche gedereþ flowres partie white and rede
To make a sotil garland for hire heuede
And as an Angel heuenyssly sche songe

Whiche of þe Castel was þe chef dongeone
There as þe knyhtes weren in prison
Of whiche I tolde ȝowe and telle schall
Was euen Ioynant to þe Gardeine wall
There as þis Emely had hire pleyinge
Brihte was þat sonne and clere in þat Morneynge
And Palamon þis woful prisonere

In whiche he all þe nobel Cite sihe
An eke þe Gardeine ful of braunches grene
Ther as þe frissche Emely þe schene

And to him selfe compleinynge of his woo

Of yren grete and sware as any sparre

 And wiþ þat worde Arcite gan aspie
Where þat þis ladi romede to and fro
And wiþ þat siht hire beaute hurte him so
That if palamon was wounded sore

And wiþ a sike he seide Pitously

Of hir þat romeþ in þat ȝonder place
And bot I haue hir merci and hir grace

And þere positif lawe and swyche decree

A man most nedes loue maugrif his hede

Ac þerefore att þe kinges courte my broþer

To tellen it ȝow as schortly as I maye
A worthi Duc þat hiht Perotheus

Was commen to Athenes his felawe to visite
And for to pleie as he was wont to do

And he loue him also as tendrely aȝeine
So wele þey loued as olde bokes seine
That whanne þat one was dede sothely to tell
His felaw went and sowht him downe in hell
Bot of þat stori leste me nouht to write
Duc Perotheus louede wel Arcite
And him knowe att Thebes ȝere be ȝere
And ffinally  att request  and prayere
Of Perotheus wiþowten any Raunson
Duc Theseus him lete owte of prison
ffrely to gone where þat him list ouer all
In suche a gise as I ȝowe telle schall
This was þe forward pleinly to endite
Betwex Theseus and him Arcite
That if so were þat Arcite was fownde
Euere in his lif be daie or nyht or stownde
In any Contre of þis Theseus


And war cauht it was accorded þus
That wiþe a swerde he scholde lese his hede
Ther nas none oþere remedye ne rede
Bot takeþe his leue and homwarde he him spedde
Lat him be war his nek liþe to wedde
How grete a sorwe suffurþe nowe arcite  
The deþe he feleþ þoruhe his hert smite
He wepeþe he weyleþ and crieþ pitously
To slene him self he waiteþ priuely
He seide alas þat I was borne
Nowe is my prison werse þan beforne
Nowe is me schape eternalie to dwelle
Nouht in purgatorie Bot in helle
Alas þat euer I knewe Perotheus
ffor elles had I dwelled wiþ Theseus
Ifetterd in his prison euer mo
Than had I bene in blisse and nowht in woo
Onely þe siht of hire whome þat I serue
Thouhe þat I neuere hir grace miht deserue
Wholde haue ysuffised riht Inowhe for me
 O dere Cosine Palamon quod he
Thine is þe victorie of þis auenture
fful blisfully in prisōn mayght þou dure
In prison sertes naye bot Paradise
Wele haþ fortune turned þe dise
That haþe þe siht of hire and I þe absence
ffor possible is seþþe þou hast hir presence
And art a kny a worþi and an able
That be som caas fortune is chaungeable
Thou maiste to þi desire somtime ateigne
Bot I þat am exiled and bareigne
Of al grace and in so grete dispeire
That þer nys erþe water fire ne ayre
Ne creature þat of hem Maked is
That may me helpe ne do me comford in þis
Wele owht I sterue In wanhope and distris


    
Alas why pleine men so in Comune
On purueance of god or of fortune
þat ȝeueþe hem ful of in many a gise
Wele bet þan þei can hem self deuise
Som man desireþ for to haue richesse
þat cause is of his mordre or grete sekenesse
And som man wolde owte of his prison fayne
That in his house is of his meine sleyne
Infinite harmes bene in þis matiere
We wote nowht what þinge we praien hiere
We faren as he þat dronken is as a mouse
A dronken man wote wele he haþe an house
Bot he note whiche þe riht waie is þedere  
And to a dronken man þe waie is scleþere
And certes in þis werlde so faren we
We seken fast after felicite
Bot we gone wronge oft ful trewli
Thus maie we seine all and namelyche I
That wende and had a grete opinione
That if I myht scippe fro prisone
Than had I bne in Ioye and parfit hele
There nowe I am exiled fro my wele
Sen þat I may not sene ȝowe Emelye
I am bot dede þer nyse no remedie
 Vpon þat oþere side Palamon
Whan þat he wiste þat Arcite was agone
Suche sorwe he makeþ þat þe grete toure
Resouneþ of his ȝellinge and clamour
The pore fettres on his schinnes grete
Were of his bitter salte teres wete
Alas quod he Arcita Cosyn myne
Of al oure strif god wote þe fruyt is þine
Thow walkes now in Thebes att þi large
And of my woo þou ȝeuest litel charge
Thou maiste sinne þou hast wisdome and manhede


Assemble al þe folke of ȝoure kinrede
And Maake a werre so scharpe on þis Cite
That be som auenture or sum trete
Thou maiste haue to lady and to wife
ffor whome þat I most nedes lese my life
ffor as be weie of Possibilite
Sethe þou art att þi large of prison fre
An art a lorde grete is þine avantage
More þan is myne þat sterueþe here in a cage
 ffor I mote wepe and waile wil þat I leue
With al þe wo þat prison maie me ȝeue
Ande eke wiþe peine þat loue me ȝeueth also
That dowbleþ al my turment and my wo
Tharewiþe þe fire of Ielousie vp sterte
Withinne his breste and hente him be þe herte
So woodly þat he like was to beholde
The box tree or þe asshen dede or colde
 Than seide he O cruel goddes þat gouern
This werlde wiþ byndeinge of ȝowre worde eterne
And wreten in þe table of Atthamaunt  
Ȝowre parlement and ȝowre eterne graunt
What is Mankinde More vnto ȝo holde
Than is þe schepe þat rowkeþ in þe folde
ffor sleine is man riht as anoþere beste
And duelleþe eke in prison and in areste
And haþe sekenesse and grete aduersite
And ofte time giltles parde
 What gouernance is in þis prescience
That giltles tormenteþ Innocence
And encreseþ þus al my penaunce
That man is bounde to his obseruaunce
ffor goddes saake to letten of his will
þere as a beste maie al his lust fulfill
And whan a beste is dede it haþe no peine
Bot after his deþe man moste wepe and pleyne
Thouhe in þis werlde he haue care and woo


Wiþowten doute it maie stonden soo
The ansewere of þis lette I to dyuines
Bot wele I wote þat in þis werlde grete peine es
Alas I see a serpent or a þef
That mony a trewman haþ done meschief
Gone att his large and where him list maie turne
Bot I most be in prison þoruhe Saturne
An eke þoruhe Iuno Ialous and eke wode
That haþe destruyde nyhe al þe blode
Of Thebes wiþ his waste walles wide
And venus flieþ me on þat oþere side
ffor Ialousie and fere of him Arcite
 Nowe wil I stinte of Palamon a lite
And lat him in his prisone stille dwelle
And of Arcite forþe I will ȝowe telle
The somer passeþ and þe nihtes longe
Encreseth dowble wise þe peynes stronge
Boþe of þe louere and þe prisonere
I note wiche haþe þe wofuller myster
ffor schortelye for to seine þis Palamon
Perpetuely is dampned to prison
In chynes and fettres to þe dede
And Arcit is ercilede vpon his hede
ffor euere more as oute of þat Cuntre
Ne neuere ne schal his lady see
 Ȝowe louiers I aske þis questiōne  
Who haþ þe wers Arcite or Palamōne
The one maie se his lady  daie be daie
Bot in prison he most dwel alweie
The toþere where him liste Maie ride or goo
Bote sene his lady schal he neuer moo
Nowe demeþ as ȝowe liste þat ȝe canne
ffor I wil tel forþe as I beganne
 Whan þat Arcite to Thebes commen was
fful often adaie he swelte and seide alas
ffor seen his ladi schal he neuer moo
And schortly to concluden al his woo
So muche sorwe had neuer creature
That is or schall whil þat þe werde mai dure
His slepe his mete his drinke is beraft
þat lene he wex and drie as is a schaft
His yhe hollowe and grisely to beholde
His hiew falowe and pale as asshe colde
And solitarie he was and euer a lone
And weyleynge al þe nyht makinge his mone
And if he herde songe or instrument
Than wolde he wepe he myht nouht be stent
So feble eke were his spretes and he lowe
And Chaungede so þat noman couþe knowe
His speche nor his voice þouhe men hit herde
And in his gere for al þe werlde he ferde
Not comly lyke to louers maledye
Of heres bot raþer like manye
Engenderd of humor malancolike
Beforne his celle ffantastike
And scortly torned was al vp and downe
Boþe Abite and disposicioune
Of him þis woful louer dame Arcite
 Wat schold I al daie of his wo endite
Whan he endured had a ȝere or two
This cruel torment and þis peine and woo
As Thebes in his Contre as I seide
Vpon a nyhte on slepe as he him leide
Him þouht howe þat venged god Mercurie
Beforne him stode and bad him to be merie
His slepi ȝerde in honde he bar vp riht
An hatte he werede vpon his heres briht


Arraide was þis god as as he toke kepe
As he was whan þat Argus toke his slepe
And seide him þus to Athenes þow schalt wende  
Where is þe schapen of þi woo an ende
 And wiþ þat worde Arcite woke and sterte
Now trewli how sore þat me smerte
Quod he to Athenes riht nowe wil I fare
Ne for þe drede of deþe schal I nouht spare
To se my lady þat I loue and serue
In hire presence I reche not to sterue
And wiþ þat worde he cauht a grete Mirroure
And sauhe þat chaunged was al his coloure
And sauhe his vesage al in anoþer kinde
And riht anone it ran him in his mynde
That seþ his face was so disfigurede
Of þe Maledy whiche he had endurede
He myht wele if þat he bare him lowe
Leue in Athenes euer more vnknowe
An seen his lady wel ny day be daye
And riht anone he chaunged his Araye
And clad him as poure laborere
An al alone saue onely o swiere
That knewe his priuete and al his case
Whiche was disgised pouerly as he was
To Athenes is gone þe next waye
And to þe courte he went vpon a daye
And att þe gate he proferd his seruyse
To drugge and drawe what so men wil deuise
And schortly of þis mater for to seine
He fel in office wiþ a chamburleine
The whiche þat was dwellinge wiþ Emelye
ffor he was wise and sone couþe aspye
ffor euery seruant whiche þat serueþ here
Wele couþe he hewen wode and water bere
ffor he was ȝonge and myhti for þe nones
And þerto he was stronge and briht of bones


To done þat any whit him can devise
A ȝere or two he was in þis seruise
Page of þe chambere of Emely þe briht
And Philostrat he seide þat he hiht
Bot halfe so wele beloued a man as he
Ne was þere neuer in Courte of his degre
He was so gentil of condicioune
That þoruheowte al þe courte was his renoune
Thei seide þat it were a charite  
That Theseus wolde enhaunse his degre
And putten him in worschipful seruise
There as he myht his vertue exercise
And þus wiþinne a while his name is spronge
Boþe of his dede and his good tonge
That Theseus haþe taken him so nere
That of his chambre he maade him a swiere
And ȝaue him gold to mainteigne his degre
And eke men brouht him oute of his contre
ffro ȝere to ȝere so priuely his rente
But onestly and sleyhtly  he it spente
þat noman wondred howe þat he it hadde
And þrei ȝere in þis wise his lif he ladde
And bare him so in pees and eke in werre
There was no man þat Theseus hathe derre
And in þis blisse let I nowe Arcite
And speke I will of Palamon a lite
 In derkenes and horrible and stronge prisone
Þis seuen ȝere haþe siten Palamone
fforpined whate for wo and for destresse
Who feleþ double sore and heuinesse
Bot Palamon þat loue destreyneþ so
That woode owte of his witte he goþ for wo
And eke þereto he is a prisoner
Perpetuelly not onely for a ȝere
Who couþe rime in Englisshe propurly
His martirdome for soþe it am not I


Therefore I passe al so lihtly as I maye
 It fel þat in þe seuent ȝere of maie
The þridde nyhte as holde bokes seine
That all þis story telleþ more pleine
Were it be aventure or destanye
As whan a þinge is schape it schal bye
Þat sone after þe mydenyht Palamon
Be helpinge of a frende brake prison
And fleeth þe Cite fast as he mai goo
ffor he had gif his Gailer drinke soo
Of a clarre maade of a certein wyne
Wiþ nercotiks and opie of Thebes fyne
That al þat nyht þouhe þat men wold him schake
The Gaillere slepe he myht nouht awake
And þus he flieþ as fast as euere he maie  
The nyht was schort and fast be þe daie
That nedes coste he most him self hiden
And til a groue faste fast þere besiden
Wiþ dredful fote þan stalkeþ Palamon
ffor schort þis was his opinion
That in þat groue he wolde him hide aldaie
And in þe nyht þan wolde he take his waie
To Thebeswarde his frendes for to praye
On Theseus to helpe him to werreie
Or schortly he wolde lese his lif
Ore wynnen Emely to his louely wif
This is þefecte and his entente pleine
 Now whiles turne we to Arcite aȝeine
That litel wiste how nihe þat was his care
Til þat fortone hadde cauht him in his snare
The besi larke messagiere of daie
Salueþ in hir songe þe morwe greie
And firy phebus riseþ vp so bright
Þat al þe orient lawheþ of þe sight
And wiþ his streme drieþ in þe greues
The siluer dropes hangeinge on þe leues


And Arcita þat in þe courte roial
Wiþ Theseus his swier principal
Is resen and lokeþ on þe mery daie
And for to done his obseruance to maie
Remembringe on þe pointe of his desire
He on his coursere stertynge as fire
Is reden to þe feldes him to pleie
Owte of þe Court were it a meyle or tweye
And to þe groue of whiche as  ȝow tolde
Be aventur his weie he gan to holde
To Maken him a garlonde of þe greues
Were it of wodebinde or of heiþorne leues
And loude he songe aȝein þe sonne schene
Maie wiþ al þi floures and þi grene
Welcom be þou feire fresche Maie
I hop þat I sume grene get maie
And from his coursur wiþ a lusti herte
In to þe groue ful hastely he sterte
And in a paþe he romeþ vp and doune
Thar as be aventur of þis Palamon
Was in a busshe þat no man miht him see  
ffor sore aferde of his deþe was he
No þinge knewe he þat it was Arcite
God wote he wolde haue trowed it ful lite
Bot soþe is seide gon siþe many ȝeres
That felde haþe yȝen and wode haþe eres
It  ful faire a man to bere him euen
ffor aldaie meteþ men att vnsette steuen
fful litel wote arcite of his felawe
Þat was so nyhe to herken of his sawe
ffor in þe busche he sitteþ now ful still
Whan þat Arcite had romede al his fill
And songen al þe roundel lustely
In to a stody he fel sodanly
As done þes louers in hir queynte geres
Nowe in þe crope nowe downe in þe breres


Nowe vp nowe downe as a boket in a welle
Riht as þe fridaie soþeli for to telle
Nowe it schineþe nowe it reineþ fast
Riht so gan geri venus ouer cast
The hertes of hir folke riht as hir daie
Is gerful riht so chaungeþ sche arraie
Seld is þe fridaie al þe weke ylike
 Whan þat Arcite had songe he gan to sike
And set him doune wiþowten any more
Alas quod he þat daie þat I was bore
Howe longe Iuno þoruhe þi crueltee
Wiltow werien Thebes þe Citee
Alas brouht it is to confusione
The blode Roial of Cadine and Amphione
Of Cadinus whiche þat was þe first man
That Thebes bulet or first þe toune began
And of þe Cite first was Crouned kinge
Of his linage am I and of his ospringe
Be verrei ligne as of þe stok Roialle
And Now I am so caitif and so þralle
That he þat is my mortal ennemye
I serue him as his swier pouerelye
And ȝit doþe me Iuno wel more schame
ffor I dar I not beknowe myne owne name
Bot þere as I was wonte hiht Arcite
Now hiht Philostrate not worþe a myte
Allas þou fel mars Allas þou Iuno
Thus haþe ȝower ire owre lignage al fordo
Saue only me and wreched palamon  
That Theseus Martireþ in prison
And ouer al þis to slene me vtterly
Loue haþ faire his darte so brinyngly
Istiked þoruhe my trewe careful herte
That schapen was my deþ arst þan my scherte
Ȝe slene me wiþe ȝowere yhen Emelye
The be þe cause werefor þat I die


Of al þe remenan of myne oþere care
Ne sette I nouht þe mountance of a tare
So þat I couþe do ouhte to ȝowre plesance
And wiþ þat worde he fel doune in a trance
A longe tim and he afterwarde vpstert
 This Palamon þat þouht þat þoruhe his herte
He felde a colde swerde sodeinly glide
ffore ire he whoke no lenger wolde he bide
And whan þat he had herde Arcites tale
As he were wode wiþe face dede and pale
He stert him vpe oute of þe boskes þikke
And seide Arcite false treitoure wikke
Nowe art þow hent þat louest mi ladie so
ffor whome þat I haue al þis peine and woo
And art my blode and to my consel sworne
As I ful oft haue tolde þe here beforne
And hast bejaped here Duc Theseus
And falsely haste þou chaunged þi name þus
I wil be dede or elles þou schalt diȝe
Thou schalt nouht loue my ladie Emelye
Bot I will louere onely and no mo

And þoughe þat I no wepen haue in þis place
Bot owte of prisoun am asterte be grace

Or þou ne schat not louen Emelye
Ches whiche þou wilte or þou schalt nouht asterte
 This Arcite wiþ ful dispitouse herte
Whan he him knewe and had his tale herde
As fers a lion he pulled owte a swerde
And seid þus be god þat sitteþ aboue
Nere it were þat þou art seke and woode for loue
And eke þat þou no wepen hast in þis place

That þou ne scholdest deiȝen of myne honde

And bringen herneys riht ynowhe for þe

And mete and drinke þis nyht wil I bringe

And if so be þat þou my lady wynne
And sle me in þis wode þare I am inne

This Palamon ansewerd I graunt it þe
And þus þei bene departid til on morwe

Occupiede owte of al charite
 O regne þat wolde no felawe haue wiþ þe
fful soþe is seide þat loue ne lordeschipe
Wil not his þonkes haue no felauschipe
We finde þat of arcite and of Palamone

And on þe morwe ar it were daies liht

And on his hors alone as he was borne

And in þe groue att þe time and place ysette

To chaungen gan þe coloure in her face
Riht as þe hunters in þe Reigne of Trace

And hereþ him come rossheinge in þe greues

And after þat wiþ scharpe speres stronge
Thei foynen eche att oþere wonder longe

In his feihtinge were a wode lyon ·
And as a cruel tigre was Arcite
As wilde bores gunne þei to smyte
Þat froþen white as fome for ire wode
Vp to þe Ancle fouht þei in þeire blode
And in þis wise I lete hem feihtinge dwelle
And forþ I wil of Theseus ȝowe telle
The destanye Ministre general
That executeþ in þe werld oueral
The Purueance þat god haþ seie before


— For some men sain that God seeth all beforne
    
Than mote it fallen though men had it sworne
That purveiaunce hath seene beforne to be—
So stronge it is þat þeihe þe werlde had it swore
The contrarie of a þinge be ȝe or naye
Ȝit some time it schal fal on a daye
Þat falleþ nouht eft wiþinne a þousande ȝere
ffor certeinly oure appetites here
Be it of werre of pese or hate or loue
All is þis rewled be þe siht aboue
This Mene I nowe be myhty Theseus
That for to hunt is so desirus
And namely att þe grete hert in maie
That in his bed þere daweþ him no daie


Þat he na es clad and redi for to ride
Wiþ hunte and horne and hundes him biside
ffor in his huntynge haþe he swyche delite
That it is al is hope Ioy and appetite
To bene him self þe grete hertes bane
ffor after mars he serueþ now Diane
Clere was þe daie as I haue told ar þis
And Theseus wiþ al Ioy and blisse
Wiþ his ypolita þe faire quene
And Emely cloþed al in Grene
On huntyn bene þe reden Roially  
And to þe Groue þat stod ful fast by
In whiche þer was an herte as men him tolde
 Duc Theseus þe streiht waie haþ holde
And to þe launde he rideþ him ful riht
ffor þeder was þe hert wonte to haue his fliht
And ouer a broke and so forþe on his weie
This Duc wil haue a cours att him or tweie
Wiþ houndes suche as him lust commaunde
And whan þis Duc wa come vn to þe launde
Vnder þe sonne he loked And anone
He was war of Arcite and Palamone

The briht swerdes wenten to and foo
So hydously þat wiþ þe lest stroke
It semeþ þat it wald fel an oke
Bot whate þei were noþinge he wote
This Duc his Coursur wiþ his spores smote
And att a sterte he was betwix hem two
And pulled owte a swerde And cride ho
No more vpon peine of leseynge of ȝoure hede
Be myhti Mars he schal anone be dede
That smyteþ any stroke þat I maie seen
Bot telle me what mester men ȝe been
That bene so hardy to feihten here
Wiþowten Iugge or oþer officere

Bot sle me first for seinte Charite
And sle my felaw eke as wele as me
Or sle him for þouhe thou knowest it lite
Þis is þi mortal fo þis is Arcite
That fro þi londe is banysshed on his hed
ffor whiche he haþe deserued to be dede
ffor þis is he whiche come vn to þi gate
And seide þat he hiht Philostrate
Thus haþe he Iaped þe ful mony a ȝere  
And þou hast maade him þi chef swyere
And þis is he þat loueþ Emelye
ffor seþ þat daie is come þat I schal diȝe

Þat loueþe so hote Emelye þe brihte

Wherefore I ax deþe and my Iuyse
Bot sle my felawe in þe same wise

 This worþi Duc ansewerd anone aȝeine
And seide this is a schort conclusione
Ȝowre owren mouþe be ȝowre confessione
Haþe dampne ȝow and it wil recorde
It nedeþ nouht to pyne ȝowe wiþ corde
Ȝe schal be ded be myhti Mars þe rede

Gan for to wepe and so dide Emelie
And al þe ladies in þe companye
Grete pite was as hem þouht alle
That euer suche a chaunce shold falle

And noþinge bot for loue was þis debate
And sauhe hire blody woundes wide and sore
And al criden boþe lasse and more
Haue merci lorde vpon vs wemmen alle
And on her bare knees downe þei falle
And wolde haue kist his fote þere as he stode
Til att laste aslaked was his moode

And þouhe he firste fore Ire quoke and sterte
He considered schortly in a clause
The trespas of hem boþe and eke þe cause
And alþouhe þat his Ire hir gilte accusede
Ȝit in his reson he hem boþ excusede
And þus he þouht wele þat euery man
Wil helpe him selfe in loue if þat he can
And eke deliuere him self owte of prisone
And eke his herte had compassione
Of wemmen for þei wepen euer in one  
And in his gentill hert he þouht anone
And soft vn to him self he seide fie
Vpon a lorde þat wille haue no mercye
Bot he be lyone boþe in worde and in dede
To hem þat bene in repentance and drede
Al so wele as to a proude dispitous man
That wil Maiten þat he first began
That lorde haþ litel of discrecion
That in suche cas can no deuision
And weieþe pride and humblenesse after one
And whan his Ire is þus agone
He gan to Loken vpe wiþ yhe liht
And spake þis same wordes al on hiht


 The god of loue A Benedicite
Howe myhti and howe grete a lorde is he
Aȝeines his myhtes þere gayneþ none obstacles
He maie be cleped a god for his miracles
ffor he can maken att his owen gise
Of eueryche hert as þat him list deuise

Thus haþe hire lorde þe god of loue ypaide

That sche for wham þei haue þis Iolite

Sche woote no more of all þis hote fare
Bi god þan wote a cokkowe or an hare
Bot al mot bene assaide hote and colde
A man most be a foole or ȝonge or olde
I wote it be my selfe ful ȝore agone  
ffor in my time a seruant was I one
And þarefore seþ I knowe of loues peine
I woote howe sore it kan a man distreine
As he þat haþe bue cauht oft in his lace

At þe request of þe quene þat kneleþ here
And Eke of Emely my suster dere


And ȝe schall Boþe anone vn to me swere

And þei him sworne his axen faire and wele
And him of lordeschipe and of Mercie preide
And hem graunteþe grace and þus he seide
 To speke of Roial lignage and richesse
Thouhe þat sche weere a queene or a Princesse
Eche of ȝowe boþe is worþi doutelesse
To wedden whan time is bot naþelesse

And forþi I ȝowe pute in þis degre
That iche of ȝow schal haue his destanye

Lo here ȝowre ende of þat I schal deuise
 Mi will is  for plate conclusione

If þat ȝowe likeþ takeþ it for þe beste
That eueryche of ȝowe schal gone where him leste

And  þis daie fifty wekes fer ne nere

Sle his contrarie or owte of listes driue
That schal I ȝeue Emelia to wif
To whome þat fortone ȝeueþ so faire a grace
The listes schal I maken in þis place
And god so wisly on my soule rewe

Þat one of ȝowe ne schall be dede or takene
And ȝif ȝowe þinkeþ þis is wele Iseide

This es ȝoure ende and ȝoure conclusione
Who lokeþ lihtly nowe bot palamone
Who springeþ vp for ioie bot arcite
Who couþe telle or who couþe it endite
The ioye þat is maked in þe place
Whan Theseus haþe done so faire a grace
But downe one knees went euery manere wiht
And þonked him wiþ al here hert and myht
And namely þe Thebanes oft siþe
And þus wiþ good hope and wiþþe herte bliþe

Ȝif I forȝate to tellen þe dispence
Of Theseus þat goþe so besily
To Maken vp þe listes roially
Þat suche a noble theatre as it was
I dare wele saie in þe werlde þere nas
The circuite a Mile was aboute
Walled of stone and diche all wiþoute
Rounde was þe schappe maner of compas


fful of degrees þe heighte of sexti pas
That whan a man was sette on o degree

Estwarde þere stoode a gate of marble white
Westward riht stoode anoþer in þe opposite
And schortly to conclude suche a place
Was none in erþe and in so litel a space
ffor in þe londe þere nas no crafti man  
That Geomatrie or arce metrik can

Thas Theseus ne ȝafe mete and wages
The Theatre to make and to deuise
And for to done his riht and sacrifice
He Estwarde haþ vpon þe gate aboue
In worschipe of venus goddes of loue
Done maken an Auter and an Oratorie
And in þe westwarde in Memorie
Of Marce he Maked haþe riht suche anoþer
Þat cost largeli of gold a foþer
And Northwarde in a toret on· þe walle
Of Alabastre white and rede Coralle
An oratorie riche for to se
In worschipe of Dyane of chastite
Haþe Theseus don wrouht in noble wise
Bot ȝite had I forgeten to deuise

And a kokkowe sittinge on his honde

Of loue whiche þat rekened and reken schall

And þouhe I couþe rekken a þousand mo

And fro þe nauel doune al couerd was
Wiþ wawes grene and briht as any glas

And on hir hede ful semely for to see

Aboue hire hede here doufes flikeringe

Vpon his scholderes wenges had he tuo
And blinde he was as it is oft sene
A bowe he bare and arwes briht and kene

In whiche þere dwelled neyþer man ne beste
With knotty knarry baran tres olde
Of stubbes scharpe and hidouse to beholde
In whiche þer ran a rombel in a swouhe
As þouhe a storme scholde berste euery bouhe
And dounewarde from an hill vnder a bent  
Ther stode þe temple of Mars armipotent
Wrowht al of Burnede stele of wyche þentre
Was longe and streite and gastly for to see
And þere owte come a rage and suche a veze
That maade al þe gates for to rese

The dores waren all of Attemant etene

Wiþ yren toughe and for to make it stronge

Vnder þe whele ful lowe he laie a doune  
There were also of Martis diuisioune

That forgeþ scharpe swerdes on his stiþe
And al aboue depeinted in a toure

Wiþ þe scharpe swerde ouere his hede

And ouere his heuede þere schines two figures
Of sterre þat bene closed in scriptures

Depeinted bene þe walles vp and doune
Of huntynge and of schamfast chastite

And after was sche maade þe lodesterre
Thus was sche peinted I can sei ȝowe no ferre
Hir sone is eke a sterre as men Maie see
Thar sawhe  Dane turned til a tree

Bot Penneus douhter whiche þat hiht Dane
 Ther sawhe I Accheon an herte ymaked  
ffor veniaunce þat he sawhe Diane al nakede
I sawhe howe þat his hondes haþ him cauht
And freten him for þat þei knewe him nauht
Ȝite ypeinted was a litel forþermore


Howe Athalance hunted þe wilde bore
And Meliagre and mony an oþer moo
ffor whiche Diane wrouht care and woo
There sawhe I many a noþer wondere storie
The whiche me luste nouht drawe to memorie
 This Goddes on an hert ful hihe sche seete
Wiþ smalle houndes al aboute her feete
And vnderneþe hire feete sche had a mone
Waxinge it was and scholde wany sone
In gaude grene hire statue cloþed was

Bot stinte I will of Theseus a lite
And speke of Palamon and of Arcite

And til Athenes here couenant for to holde
Haþe eueryche of hem brouht an C knyhtes

An sekurly þere trowed mony a man
That neuer siþþe þat þe werlde began

And wold his þonkes and haue a passant name  
Haþe preide þat he myhte be of þat game
And wel was him þat þereto chosen was

Were it in Ingelonde or elles where
Thei wolde here þonkes willen to be þere
To fighte for a lady benedicite
It were a lusti siht for to see
And riht so ferden þei wiþ Palamon
Wiþe him þere went knyhtes manyon
Some wol ben armed in an haburgeon
And in a breste plate  And in a liht Iepon
And some wil haue a paire plates large
And some wil haue a pruce schelde or a targe
Some wel bene armed on his legges wele
And haue an ax and some a mace of stele
Thar is no new gise þat it nas holde
Armed were þei as I haue ȝowe tolde
Eueryche after his opinione
Thare maistowe see comynge wiþ palamon
Ligurge him selfe þe grete kinge of trace
Blake was his berde and manly was his face
The cercles of his yhen in his hede
Thei glowde betwix ȝalowe and rede
And like a griffon loked he aboute
With kempe heres on his browes stoute
His limes grete  his braune harde and stronge
His scholdres brod  his armes rounde and longe
And as þe gise was in his contre
fful hihe vpon a chare of gold stode he
Wiþþe foure white boles in þe trays
In stede of cote armoure ouer his hernays
Wiþ naille ȝelow and briht as any golde


He had a berskinne coleblake for olde
His longe here was kembed behinde his bak
As any Rauenes feþer it schane for blak
A wreþe of golde arme grete of huge wighte
Vpon his hede sette ful of stones briht
Of fine Rubies and of diamantz
Aboute his chare þer went white alantz
Twenty and moo as grete as any stere  
To hunten att þe lyon or þe dere
And folowed him wiþ mosel fast bounde
Colers of golde and turettes filed rounde
An C lordes had he in his Route
Armed ful wele wiþ hertes sterene and stoute
 Wiþ Arcita in Stories as men finde
The grete Emetrius þe kinge of Inde
Vpon a stede baie trapped in stele
Couerd wiþ cloþe of gold diapred wele
Cam rideinge like þe god of Armes mars
His cote armur was of cloþe of tars
Couched wiþ perles white and rounde and grete
His sade was of brent gold new ybette
A mantelet vpon his scholdere hongeynge
Breteful of Rubies rede as fire sparklinge
His crispe here like ringes was yronne
And þat was ȝalowe and gleteringe as þe sone
His nose was hihe his yȝen briht Citrine
His lippes rounde  his colour was sanguyne
A fewe fraknes in his face ysprined
Betwix ȝalowe and somdel blak ymeyned
And as lion he his lokeynge cast
Of five and twenti ȝere his age I cast
His berd was wele begunne for to springe
His vois was as a trompe thundringe
Vpon his hede he wered of laurer grene
A garland fresche and lusti for to seene
Vpon his honde he bare for his deduyte


An Egle tame as any lely white
An C lordes had he wiþ him þere
Al armed saue hire hedes in al her gere

 And in þis wise þes lordes al and some

And Inned hem eueriche att his degree

To esen hem and done hem al honoure
That ȝit men weneþ þat nomannes witte
Of none astate ne couþe amende it

Ne who satt first ne last vppon þe deis
What ladies fairest bene or best daunceinge
Or whiche of hem can best daunsen or singe
Ne who moste feleingelike spekeþ of loue

Of all þis make I nowe no mencioune

Vnto þe blisful Citharea benigne

And in hire houre he walkeþ forþe apace
Vnto þe listes þer hir temple wace
An doune he kneled and wiþ humble chere
And hert sore he seide as ȝe schal here

That al þat monday Iousten þei and daunce
And spende it in hihe venus seruise  
Bot be þe cause þat þei scholde rise
Erly for to seen þe grete fighte
Vnto her reste went þei att nihte
And on þe morwe whan þe dai gan springe
Of hors and herneys noyse and clateringe
There was in hostries al aboute
And to þe Paleys rode þer mony a route
Of lordes vpon stedes and palfreis
There maist þou seen diuiseinge of harneys
So vnkouþe and so riche and wrouhte so wele
Of gold smyþerie of brondeinge and of stele

Some seide he loked grimme and he wolde fihte

Thus was þe hal ful of diuineinge
Longe after þat þe sonne gan to springe
The grete Theseus þat of his slepe awaked
Wiþ mynstralcye and noys þat was maked
Held ȝite þe Chambres of his palays riche
Til þat þe Thebanes knyhtes boþen yliche

Arraide riht as he were a god in Throne  
The peple presed þederwarde ful sone

And eke to herken his heste and his sentence

And whan he sawe þe peple of noyse al still
Thus schewed he þe myhty dukes will
 The lorde haþ of his hihe discrecione
Considered þat it were destructione
To gentil blode to fihten in þis gise
Of Mortaile bataile nowe in þis emprise
Wharefor to schapen þat þei schal not deye
He will his first purpos modefye
No man þarfore vpon peine on his lif
No manere schotte ne polax ne schorte knyfe

Ne schort swerde for to stoke wiþ pointe biteinge

And nouht sleine bot be brouht vnto þe stake

But þider he schal be force and þare abide
And if so fal þe Cheftaigne be take
On eyþer side or elles sleine his make
No longer schal þe tornynge last

The voice of þe peple touched heuen
So loude cried þei wiþ mery steuene

That þilke mouere stable is and eterne
Wele maie men knowe bot it be foole
That euery partie darrained fromme his hoole
ffor nature haþe nouȝt take his begynnynge
Of no partie nor of cantel of a thinge
Bot of a thinge þat parfite is and stable
Descendeinge so to it be corrumpable
And þerefor for  his wise purueance
He haþ so wele besette his ordenance
That specie of þinges and progressions
Schullen endure be successions
And nouht eterne wiþoute any lye
Þis maystowe vnderstonden and seen att eye
Lo þe oke þat haþe so longe a norissheynge
ffro þe time þat it first biginneþ to springe
And haþ so longe a lif as ȝe maye see
Ȝut att þe laste wasted is þe tree
Considereþ eke howe þat þe harde stone
Vnde owre fote on whiche we trede and gone
Ȝit wasteþ it as it liþe be þe weie
The brode riuer som time waxeþ dreie
The grete townes see we wane and wende
Than ȝe see þat al þis þinge haþ ende
Of man and womman see we wele also
Þat nedeþ in oone of þe teremes tuo

Som in his bede some in þe depe see
Some in þe large felde as ȝe maie see
There helpeþ nouht al goþe þat ilke weie
Þan may I seie þat al þis þinge mote deie
What makeþ þis bot Iubiter þe kinge  
That is prince  and cause of al þinge
Conuertynge all vnto his propre wille
ffro whiche it is darreyned soþe to tylle


And here ageynes non creature on lyue
Of no degre aveileþ for to striue
Than is it wisdome as þenkes me
To make vertue of necessitee
And take it wele þat we maye nouht eschewe
And name þat to vs al is dewe
And who gruccheþ ouȝt he doþe folye
And rebel is to him þat al maie guye
And serteinly a man haþ most honoure
To deyen in his excellence and floure
Whan he is seker of his good name
Than haþe he done his frendes ne him no schame
And gladder ouhte his frendes bene of his deþe
Whan wiþe honoure is ȝolden vp þe breþe
Than whanne his name apalled is for age
ffor al forȝeten is his vessellage
Than is þe best as for a worþi fame
To deyȝen whan he is best of name
The contrarie of al þis is wilfulnes
Whi grucchen we whi haue we heuynes
That good Arcite of chiualrye þe floure
Departed is wiþ dewte and wiþ honoure
Owte of þis foule Prisone of þis life
Whi gruccheþ here his cosine and his wife
Of his welfare þat loueþ him so wele
Kanneþ he hem þonke nay  god wote neuer a dele
That boþen his soule and eke him offende
And ȝit þei mowe her lustes nouȝt amende
What  may I conclude of þis longe serie
Bot after woo I rede vs to be merie
And þanke Iubiter al his grace
And er we departen frome þis place

O parfite Ioye lasteinge euermo

 Suster quod he þis is my ful assente

And taken him for husbonde and for lorde
Lene me ȝowre honde for þis is oure accorde
Lat see nowe of ȝowre wommanly pyte
He is a kinges broþer sonne parde
And þouhe he weere a pouer bachellere
Sen he haþe serued ȝowe so mony a ȝere
And had for ȝowe so grete aduersite
It moste be considered leueþ me

Þan seide he þus to Palamon þe knyht

To make ȝowe assente to þis þinge
Comeþ nere and takeþ ȝowre lady be þe honde
Betwexen hem anone was maade þe bonde
Þat hiht Matrimoigne or mariage

And wiþ al blis and melodye
Haþe Palamon ywedded Emelye
An god þat haþe al þis werlde wrouht
Sende him his loue þat haþ it dere bouht
ffor nowe is Palamon in al his wele
Leueinge in blis richesse and hele
And Emely him loueþ so tenterly
And he hir seuith so gentilly
That þere no worde was hem betwene
Of Iolousy or any oþer tene
Thus Endeþ Palamon and Emelye
And god saue al þis faire compaignye
Whan þat þe knyht had þus  his tale ytolde
In al þe company nas þere ȝonge ne holde
That he ne seide it was noble storye
And worþi for to drawen in memorie
And nameliche þe gentils euerychone

This goþe ariht vnboklede is þe male
Lat see nowe who schal tel anoþer tale
ffor trewly þe game is wele begunne  
Now telleþ ȝe sire monke if ȝe kunne
Somewhat to white wiþ þe knyhtes tale
 The Mellere þat fordronken was al pale
So þat vnneþ vpon his hors he sat
He nolde avalen neyþe hode ne hat

Bot in Pilates voice he gan to crie
And swore be armes and be blode and bones
I can a noble tale for þe nones
Wiþ whiche I wil nowe qvite þe knyhtes tale
Owre oste sauhe þat he was dronken of ale
And seide abide Robin leue broþere
Som better man schal tel us firste anoþer

Þat I am dronken I knowe it be my sowne
And þere if I speke or mys saie
Wiyte it þe ale of Souþewerk I ȝowe praie


ffor I will tell a legende and a lif
Boþen of a carpenter and his wif
Howe þat a clerke haþe sette þe wrihtes cappe
The reue ansewerde stinte þi clappe
Latt bue þi lewed dronken harlotrie
It is a sinne and eke grete folye
To appeiren any man or him defame
And eke to bringe wiues in suche fame
Þou maist ynouhe of oþere þinges saine
This dronken Meller spak ful sone aȝeine
And seid leue broþer oswolde
Who haþe no wif he is no cokewolde
But I seie nouȝt þerefore þat þou art oon
Ther bene ful gode wives Many on
    
    
Whi ert þou angri wiþ my tale nowe
I haue a wife perde as wele as þowe
ȝete nolde I note for þe oxen in my plouhe
Tak vpon me more þan I nowhe
As demen of my self þat I were oone  
I will beleue þat I am none
An husbonde schal nouht be inquisitif
Of goddes priuetees ne of his wif
So he may finde goddes foyson þere
Of þe remenant nedeþ nouht to enquere
What schold I more seie Bot þis Mellere
He nolde his wordes for noman forbere

And þerfor euery  gentil whight I preie
Demeþ nouht for goddes loue þat I seie
Of yuel enten bot þat I mot reherce
Her tales al be þei better or werse
Or elles falsen somme of my matiere
And þerefore who so list nouht to here


Torne ouere þe leue and chese anoþer tale
ffor ȝe schal finde  ynowe grete and smale
Of storial þinge þat toucheþ gentillesse
And eke moralite and holynesse
Blameþ nouȝt me if þat ȝe chesen amys
The meller is a cherle ȝe knowe wele þis
So was þe reue eke and oþer mo
And harlotrye þei tolden boþ tuo
Auiseþ ȝowe and putte me owte of blame
And eke men schal nouȝte make ernest of game
WHilom þere was dwellyng att Oxenford
A riche gnof þat gestis helde to bord
And of his craft he was a Carpentier
With him þere was dwellinge a pouer scolier
Hadde lerne arte bot al his fantasie
Was torned for to leren astrologie
And couþe a certeine of conclusions
To demen be interrogaciones
If þat men axed him in certeine houres
Whan men schold haue drouht or elles schoures
Or if men axed him what schal befalle
Of euery þinge I may nouht reken alle
This clerke was cleped hende Nicholas
Of derne loue he couþe and of solas
And þereto he was sleight and wele priue
And like a maide meke for to see
A chambre had he in þat hostellerie  
Alone wiþoute any compaignie
fful fetisly diht wiþ herbes swote
And he him selfe as swete as is þe rote
Of lycoris or of any settewale
His almagiste and bokes grete and smale
His Astrelabre longeinge to his arte
His augrim stones leyen faire a parte
On schelues chowched as his beddes hede
His prisse  ycouerid wiþ a foldeynge rede
And al aboue þere leie a gaie sawtrie
On whiche he made a nyht melodie
So swetely þat al þe chambre ronge
And Angelus ad virginem he songe
And after he songe þe kinges note
fful oft blissed was his mery þrote


And þus þe swete clerke his time spente
Affeter his frendes findeynge and his rente
This Carpenter had wedded newe a wif
Whiche þat he loued more þan his lif
Of xviij ȝere sche was of age
Ielous he was and helde hire narwe in cage
ffor sche was wilde and ȝonge and he was holde
And demed him self bene like a cokewolde
He knewe nouȝt Caton for his witte was rude
That bad men wedde his similitude
Men scholde wedde after hire astate
ffor ȝouþe and elde is often att debate
Bot seþen þat he was fallen in þe snare
He moste endure as oþere folke his kare
ffaire was þis ȝonge wif and þerto wiþ al
As any wesel hir bodi gente and smal
A seinte sche wered barred al of silke
A barmecloþe as white as any morwes mylke
Vppon hire lendes fol of mony a gore
White was hire smoke and broude al before
And eke behinde on hire colere aboute
Of cole blak silke within and eke withoute
The tapes of hir white volupere
Were of þe same sute of hire colere
Hire felet broode of silke and sitt ful hihe
And sekurly sche had a lykuruse eye
fful small ypulled was hire browes two
And þo were bente and blake as any slo
Sche was ful more blisfull for to see  
Thane is þe newe perionet tree
And softer þan wolle is of a weþer
And be hir gyrdel hinge a purs of leþere
Tassilde wiþ selke ad perlid wiþ laton
In al þis werlde to seken vpe and downe
Þere is noman so wise þat couþe þenche
So Gaye a popelote or swiche a wenche


fful brihter was þe schineinge of hir hewe
Than in þe toure þe noble forgode newe
Bott of hir songe it was so lowde and ȝerne
As any swalowe Chiterynge on a berne
Thereto sche couþe skippe and make a game
As any kide or calfe foloweynge his dame
Hir mouþe was swete as braket or þe meþe
Or horde of appeles layde in haye or heþe
Wynsinge sche was as a Ioli colte
Longe as a maste and vpriht as a bolte
A broche sche bare on hire loue colere
As brode as is þe boos of a bokelere
Hir schoes were laced on hir legges hihe
Sche was a primerol a pigges nye
ffor any lorde to liggen in his bedde
Or ȝit for any good ȝoman to wedde
 Nowe sire and eft sire so befell þe cas
That on a daie þis hende Nicholas
ffil wiþ þis ȝonge wif to rage and to pleie
While þat hire husbond was att Osenaye
As clerkes ben ful sotel and ful wheinte
And priuelye he cauht hire be þe queynte
And seide ywis bot if I haue my will
ffor derne loue of þe lemman I spill
And held hire harde be þe haunche bones
And seide lemman loue me wele att ones
Or I wille deyen also god me saue
And sche spronge as a colte doþ in þe traue
And wiþ hire hede sche wried fast awaie
Sche seide I wil nouht kisse þe be my faie
Whi labbe quod iche lat be nycholas
Or I will crie out harrowe and alas
Do weie ȝoure hondes for ȝowre curtesie
This Nicholas gan mercie for to crie
And spake so faire and proferd him so fast  
That sche hire loue grauntide him att last


And swore an heoþe be seinte Thomas of Kent
That sche wolde be att is commandement
Whan þat sche maie hir leisere wele aspie
Mine husbonde is so ful of Ielousye
That bot I weite wele and be priue
I whote riht wele I name but dede quod sche
Ȝe motte be ful derne as in þis cas
Nay þereof care þe nouht quod Nicholas
A clerke hadde liþerli besette his while
Bot if he couþe a carpenter begile
And þus þei attorden and ysworne
To wayte a tyme as I haue tolde beforne
Whan Nicholas hadde þis euery dele
And þakked hire aboute þe lendes wele
He kiste hire swete and takeþ his sautrie
And plaieþ fast and makeþ melodie
 Than fel it þus þat to þe Parissche cherche
Cristes owen werke for to werche
This good wife went on an haly daie
Hire forhed schone as briht as any daie
So was it whassche whan sche lete hir werke
Nowe was þere of þat chirche a parische clerke
The whiche þat was ycleped Absolon
Crull was his here and as þe gold it schone
And strouted as a ffan large and brode
fful streighte and euen lay his Ioly schode
His rud was rede his yen grei as goos
Wiþ poules wyndowe coruen on his schoos
In hoses rede he went fetisly
Ycladde he was ful smal and propurly
Al in a kertell of a liht wachett
fful faire and ful þike be þe pointes sett
And þere vpon he hadd a gaie surplise
As white as is þe blossome on þe Rise
A mery childe he was as god me saue
And wele couþe he laten blode or clippe or schaue


And make a charter of londe or on quitance
In twenti manere quod he trip and daunce
After þe scole of Oxenforde þo
And wiþ his legges casten to and fro
And pleyen songes in a small rebibe  
Therto he songe some time a loude quynyble
And also wele couþe he pleie on a geterne
In all þe toune nas brewes ne tauerne
That he ne viset it wiþ his solas
There any gailerd tapstere was
Bot soþe to seine he was sumdele squaymous
Of fartinge and of speche daungerous
 This absolon þat Ioly was and gaie
Goþe wiþ a censer on þe haly daie
Sensynge þe wyues of þe parische faste
And many a louely loke on hem caste
And nameli on þis Carpenteres wif
To loken on hire him þouhte a mery lyf
Sche was so propre and swete and licorous
I dar wele seie if sche hade bue a mous
And he a cat he wolde her hinte anone
This Pariche clerce þis Ioly Absolone
Haþe in his herte suche a loue longeinge
That of no wif toke he none offringe
For curtesye he seide he wolde none
The mone whan it was nyht ful briht schone
And absolon his geterne haþe ytake
ffor paramoures he þouhte for to wake
And for he goþ Iolif and amorous
Til he came to þe Carpenters hous
A litel after cokkes had ycrowe
And drissed him vp be a schot windowe
That was vp on þe carpenteres wall
He singes in his voice gentill and small
Nowe dere lady if þi willes be
I preie ȝowe þat ȝe wil rewe on me


fful wele accordant to his geterneynge
This Carpenter awoke and herd him singe
And spake vnto his wif and seide anone
What Alison heres þou not Absolone
That chaunteþ þus vnder oure boures wal
And sche ansewerde hir husbonde þerwiþal
Ȝis god wote Iohen I wote it euery dele
Þis passeþ forþe what wil ȝe bet þan wele
ffro daie to daie þis Ioli Absolon
So woweþ hire þat him is woo begoon
He wakeþ all þe nyght and al þe daie  
He kembed his lokkes brode and maade hem gaie
He woweþ hire be menes and brocage
And swore he wolde bene hir owen page
He singeþ brokkinge as a nyhtingale
He sente hir Meþe and Piment and spyced ale
And weifres pipeinge hote vnder þe glede
And for sche was of towne he proferd mede
For some folke wil be wonne with richesse
And sum for strokes and somme for gentilnesse
Somtime to schewe his lyhtnesse and Maistre
He plaieþ Heraude vpon a scafolde hihe
Bot what aveileþ him as in þis caas
Sche loueþ soo þis hende Nicholas
That absolon maie blowe þe bokkes horne
He ne haþe for his laboure bot a scorene
And þus sche Makeþ Absolon hire Ape
And al his erneste torneþ till a Iape
For soþe is þis prouerbe it is no lye
Men sein right þus Alweie þe neighe Sleyȝe
Makeþ þe fer leue to be loþe
For þouhe þat Absolon be woode or wroþe
Be cause þat he fer was from hir siht
This nyhe Nicholas stode in his liht
 Nowe bere ȝowe wele hende Nicholas
ffor Absolon may waile and singe Alas


And so befell it on a seturdaie
This Carpentier was gone to Oseneye
And hende Nicholas and Alison
Accorded bue to þis conclusione
That Nicholas schapen hem a wile
Þese sely Ielouse husbonde to beguyle
And if so be þe game went ariht
Sche scholde slepen in his arme al nyht
ffor þis was his desire and hire also
And riht anone wiþoute wordes moo
This Nicholas no langere wolde tarye
Bot doþe soft vn to his chambre Carye
Boþe mete and drinke for a daie or tweye
And to hir husbonde bad hire for to seie
If þat he axede after Nicholas
Sche scholde seie sche nyst where he was
Of al þat daie sche seihe him nouȝt with Eye  
Sche trowed þat he was in sum Maledye
ffor for no crye hire maide couþe him calle
He wolde ansewere for noþinge þat myht falle
This passeþ forþe al þilke Saturdaie
Þat Nicholas stil in his chambur leye
And ete or slepede or dide what him liste
Til þe sonday þat þe sonday goþ to riste
This sely Carpentier haþe grete Merveile
Of Nicholas or what þinge miht him aile
And seide I am adrede be seint Thomas
It stondeþ nouht ariht wiþ Nicholas
God schelde þat he deyede sodanly
This werlde is nowe ful tekel sikurly
I sihe to daie a corps borne to cherche
That nowe on Monondaie last I sawhe him werche
Go vp quod he vn to  knaue anone
Clepe att his dore or knoke wiþ a stone
Looke howe it is and tel me boldely
This knaue goþ him vp ful studely


And att þe chambre dore while þat he stode
He criede and knokked as þat he were wode
What howe what do ȝe Maister Nicholay
Howe maie ȝe slepen al þe longe daie
Bot al for nouht he herde nouht a worde
An hole he fonde ful longe vpon a borde
There as þe catte was wonte inne for to crepe
And att þat hole he loke in ful depe
And att þe last he had of him a siht
This Nicholas satt euer gapinge vpriht
As he had keked on þe newe mone
And doune he goþe and tolde his meister sone
In what araie he sauhe þis ilke man

And seide helpe vs seint ffritheswide

This man is fall wiþ his Arstromye
In some wodenes or somme Agonye

Men scholde nouht knowe of goddes priuete
Ȝe blissed be alwey a lewed man
Þat nouht bot onely his beleue can
So ferd anoþer clerke wiþ Astronomye  
He walked in to þe feldes for to prye
vppon þe sterres what þere scholde befalle
Til he was in a marle pitte yfalle
He sawhe nouht þat Bot ȝit be seint Thomas
Me rewþe sore of hende Nicholas

If þat I maie be Iesus heuen kinge
Gete me a staf þat I maie vnder spore
While þat þou Robin heueste vpe þe dore

And to þe Chambre dore he gan him dresse
His knaue was a stronge karle for þe nones
And be þe hespe he heue it vp att ones


In to þe flore þe dore fel anone
This Nicholas satt ay as still as any stone
And euer gaped vp in to þe aire
This Carpenter wende he were in despeire
And hent him be þe scholdres myhtely
And schoke him harde and cried spitously
What Nicholas what howe loke a downe
Awake and þenke on cristes passion

Therewiþe þe nyhtes spel seide he anone rihtes
Of foure halues þe hous aboute
And on þe þresshewolde on þe dore wiþoute

And after will I speke in priuete
Of certeine þinge þat toucheþ þe and me

This Carpentier goþe doune and comeþ aȝeine
And brouht of myhty ale a large quarte
And whan þat iche of hem had dronken here parte

And doune þe Carpentier be him he sette
And seide Iohn myne Ostee leue and dere

Quod þoo þis sely man I nam no labbe
And þouhe I seie I ne am not leue to gabbe
Saie whatt þou wolte I schal it neuer telle
To childe ne wife be him þat haried helle

And schal sche drenche alas myn Alisoune

And seide is no remedie in þis caas

Or þat he myht get his wif to schip

Helpe vs to scape or we bene dede iche oon

Go dere spouse and helpe to saue oure lif
 Loo whiche a grete þinge is affection
Men may deie of ymaginacione
So depe maye impressione be take
This seli Carpentier beginneþ qwake

To drenche Alison his owen dere
He wepeþ he weileþ he makeþ sori chere
He sikkeþ wiþ ful mony a sory swoghe
And goþe and geteþ him a knedeinge troughe
And after a tubbe and a kimlyne
And priuely he sent hem to his inne
And henge in þe rofe in priuete
His owene honde he made eke leddres þree
To climme by þe ronges and þe stakes  
Vnto þe tobbes hongeinge in þe balkes
And hem vitailled boþe trouhe and tubbe
Wiþe brede and chese and good ale in a Iubbe
Suffisinge  riht ynouhe as for a daie

Vpon his nede to londen for to goo
And on mononday whanne it drouhe to nyhte

And dressed al þinge as it schold be
And schortely clomben vpe al þre
Thei setten stille wele a forlonge weie
Nowe pater noster Clum seide Nicholaie
And clum  seide Iohn  and Clum seide Alison
This Carpentier seide his deuocion
And stille he sitteþ and biddeþe his preier
Awaiteinge on þe reine if he it here

Aboute Corfew time or litel more

And eft he routeþe for his hede misleie

And Alison ful soft adoune sche spedde
Wiþouten wordes mo þei gone to bedde


Ther as þe Carpentier is wonte to lye
There was þe reuel and þe melodie
And þus liþe Alison and Nicholas
In besines or merþe and of solas
Til þat þe bell of lawdes beganne to ringe
And freres in þe chauncell gonne singe
 This Parissche clerke þis amorous absolon
þat is for loue alwei so wo begone
vpon þe Monondaie was att Osneye
Wiþ company him to desporte and pleye
And axed vpon caas a cloistrere
fful priuely after Iohn þe Carpentiere
And he droughe him aparte out of þe cherche
And seide I note I seihe him here nouht wirche
Seþ Saturdaie I troue þa he be wente
ffor timbre þere oure Abbote haþ him sent
ffor he is wonte for timebre for to go  
And dwellen att þe grange a daie or tuo
Or elles he is at his hous certeine
Wher þat he be I kann nouȝt sothely seine
This Absolon ful Ioly was and liht
And þouht Now is time to wake al nyht
For sekurly I sawhe him nouhte steringe
Abouten his dore sen dai began to springe
So mote I Thriue I schal att þe Cokkes crowe
fful priuely knokken att his wyndowe
That stant ful lowe vpon his bowres wall
To Alison Nowe will I tellen all
My loue longeinge for ȝit I schall nouht mys
That att þe leste waye I schal hire kis
 Som manere comforþe schal I haue parfaie
My mouþe haþe yched all þis longe daie
That  a signe of kissinge att þe leste
All nyght me mete eke þat I was att a feste
Therefore I wil go slepe an houre or tueye
And all the nyht þan will I wake and pleye


Whan þat þe first cokko hath crowe anone
Vp riseþ þis Ioly louer Absolon
And him arrayeþ gaye and pointe deuise
Bot first he cheweþ greine and licorise
To smellen swote or he had kemped his here
Vnder his tonge a trewe loue he bere
ffor þerby wende he to be gracious
He romeþe to þe carpenteres house
And still he stant vnder þe schotte wyndowe
Vnto his breste it rauht it was so lowe
An soft he couched wiþ a seme sowne
Watt do ȝe hony combe swete Alisone
Mi faire birde mi swete Sinamome
And wakeþ lemman myne and spekeþ wiþe me
Wel litel þinken ȝe vpon my woo
That for ȝoure loue I swete ar I go
No wonder is þouhe þat I swelt and swete
I morne as doþe lome after þe tete
Iwis lemman I haue suche loue longeinge
That ilke a turtul trewe is my Morneinge
I maye note eten no more þan a maide
Go fro þe window Iak fole sche seide
 As helpe me god I will nouht be compaine  
I loue anoþer ande elles I war to blame
Wele bette þan þe be ihesu Absolone
Go for þi waie or I wil cast a stone
And lat me slepe a twenti deuel weie
Alas quod Absolon and walawaie
That trewe loue was euer so yuel besette
Than kisse me sen it maie be no bette
ffor ihesu loue and for þe loue of me
Wilt þou þan go þi weie þerewiþ quod sche

Than make þe redy quod sche I come anone
    
    
This Absolon downe sett him on his knes


And seide I am a lorde att all degres
And after þis I hope þere comeþ more
Lemman þi grace and swete birde þine ore
The wyndow scho vndoþe and þat in haste
Haue do quod sche come of and spede þe faste
Leste þat owre neybores þe Asspie
This Absolone gan wipe his mouþe ful drie
Derke was þe nyhte as pyche or as þe cole
And att þe wyndowe owte sche put hire hole
And Absolo him fel no bette ne wers
Bott wiþ his mouþe he kissed hir naked ers
fful sauorly or he was warre of þis
Abakke he sterte and þouht it was amys
ffor wele he wiste a womman haþe no berde
He felte a þinge al roughe and longe yherede
And seide fie Alas what haue I doo
Tehe quod sche and clapped þe window to
And Absolon goþe forþe a sory paas
A berde a berde seide hende Nicholas
Be goddes corps þis goþe faire and wele
This sely Absolon herde it euery dele
And on his lippe he gan for angur bite
And to him selfe he seide I scal þe qwite
Who rubbeth nowe who froteþ nowe his lippes
Wiþ duste wiþ sonde wiþ strawe wiþ cloþe wiþe chippes
Bot Absolon þat seiþe ful ofte Alas
My soule betake I to sathenas
Bot me were leuere þan al þis toune quod he
Of þis dispite awroken for to be
Alas quod he alas I ne hadde yblente  
His hote loue is colde and al yquente
ffor fro þat time þat he had kissed here ers
Of paramours he sett nouht a cres
ffor he was helede of his maladye
ffull oft paramours he gan defie
And weppe as doþe a childe þat is ybete
A soft pas he went ouere þe strete


Vnto a smyþe Men clepen Daun geruays
þat in his forge smyþeieþ  plouhe hernays
He scharpeþ schare and culter bisilie
This Absolon knokkeþ al eselye
And seide vn to geruais and þat anone
What who art þou  It am I Absolone
What Absolone  What cristes swete tree
Whi rise ȝe so raþe  ey benedicite
Whate eyleþ ȝowe some gaie gerle god it wote
Haþe brouht ȝowe þus on þe veritote
Be seint note ȝe wote wele whatt I mene
This Absolon ne rouht nouht a bene
Of al his pleie no worde aȝeine he ȝaffe
He had more towe on his distaffe
Than geruays knewe and seide frende so dere

As lene it me I haue þerwiþþe to done

Gerueys ansewerde Certes were it golde
Or in a poke nobles al vntolde
Thowe scholdest haue as I am trewe smyþþe

Thereof quod Absolon be as be maye

And cauhte þe Culter be þe colde stele
fful soft owte att þe dore he gan stele
And wente vnto þe Carpentiers wal
He koughed first and knokked þer wiþ al

Whi naye quod he god wote my swete lefe

Of golde quod he I haue þe browht a ringe

fful fyne it is and þarto wel ygraue


þis wil I ȝeuen þe  if þou me kisse
þis Nicholas was resen for to pisse
And þouhte he wolde amenden al þe Iape
He scholde kisse his ers er þat he scape
And vpe þe windowe dede he hastely
And oute his ers he put priuelye
Ouer þe buttok to þe haunche bone
And þerwiþ spak þis clerke þis absolone
Speke swete birde I note where þu ert
This Nicholas anone lete flie a fart
As grete as it had be a þonder dinte
That wiþ þat stroke he was almost yblint
And he was rede wiþ his yren hote
And Nicholas in þe ers he smote
Of goþe þe scynne an handebrode aboute
The hote culter so brent his toute
 And for þe smerte he wende for to deie
As he were woode for woo he ganne to creie
Helpe water water helpe for goddes herte
This Carpentier owte of his slomere sterte
And herde one Crie water as he was wode
And þouht alas Nowe commeþ Noes flode
And sett him vp with wordes moo
And wiþe an ax he spote þe corde a twoo
And doune goþe al He fonde Neiþer to selle
No brede Nor ale til he cam to þe selle
Vpon þe flore and þer aswowen he laye

In ronnen for to gauren vpon þis man
That on swoune laie boþe pale and wan
For wiþ þat fal he broken haþ his arme
Bot stonde he moste vnto his owen harme
For when he spake he was anone borne doune
Wiþe hende Nicholas and Alisoune


Thei tolden euery man þat he was wode
He was agast so of þe Nowels flode
Thurghe fantasie þat of his vanite
He had him bouhte knedeyng tubbes þre
And had hem hongede in þe roofe aboue  
And þat he preide him for goddes loue
To sitten in þe roof par compaignye
The folke gan lawhen att his fantasie
An to þe roofe þei keken and þei gape
And torned al his harme vnto a Iape
ffor what so þis Carpentier ansewerde
It was for nouht no man his resone herde
Wiþe oþes grete he was so sworne ydoune
That he was holden woode in all þe toune
ffor euery clerke anone riht ichone helde wiþ oþere
Thei seide þe man is wode my leue broþere
And euery white gan lauhen att his strif
Thus swyued was þe Carpentiers wif
ffor al his kepeinge and his Ielouseie
And Absolon haþe keste hire hir neþer eye
And Nicholas is scalded in his toute
This tale is done and god saue al þe route
WHan folke han lawhen att þis nyce caas
Of Absolon and hende Nicholas
Diuers folke diuersely þei seide
Bot for þe more parte þei lowhe and pleide
Ne att þis tale I sauhe no man him greue
Bot it were onely Oswolde þe Reue
Be cause he was of Carpenteres craft
A litel ire is in his hert laft
He gan to gruche and blame it a lite
So þeyke quod he ful wele couþ I ȝow quyte
Wiþ blerynge of a proude mellers eye
If þat me liste to speke of ribaudie

Til it be roten in molloke and in stree
We olde men I drede so fare we
Til we be roten can we nouht be ripe
We hopen alweie while þe werld wil pipe
For in owre wille þere stikeþ euer a naile  
To haue an hore here and a grene taile
As haþe a leke for þouhe oure myht be gone

Sen þat my tap of lif beganne to renne

Deþe drowhe þe tape of lif and lete it gone
And euery siþþe haþþe so þe tap Ironne
Till þat almoste al empti is the tonne
The streme of lif nowe droppeþ on þe chimbe
The seli tonge maie wele ringe and climbe
Of wrechedenesse þat passed is ful ȝore
Wiþ olde folke saue dotage is no more
 Whan þat oure oste had herd þis sermonynge

What schal we speke al day of holy writte

It were al time þi tale for to gynne
 Nowe sires quod Oswalde þe reue

Thowhe I ansewere and sumdel sett his howue
For leueful it is wiþ force force to schowue
This dronken melle haþe Itolde us here
Howe þat begiled was a carpentier
Parauentur in scoren for I am one
And be ȝoure leue I schal him quyte anone
Riht in his cherles termes wil I speke
I preie to god his neke mot he breke
He can wele in myne eye seen a stalke
Bot in his owen he can nouht sene a balke

At Trumpyngton nouht fer fro Cambrugge
There goþe a broke  and ouere þat a brugge
Vppon þe whiche broke þere stant a Melle
And þis is verrey soþ þat I telle
A meller was þere duellinge mony a daie
As any pekok he was proude and gaie
Pipe he couþe and fisshen and nettes bete
And torne coppes and wele wrastel and schete
Ay be his belte he bare a longe Panade
And of a swerde ful trenchant was þe blade
A Ioly popper bare he in his puche
Ther was no man for perile dorst him touche
A scheffeld þwitel bare he in his hose
Rounde was his face and kamuse was his nose
As pilled as an hape was his Sculle
He was a Market beter att þe fulle
Ther was no whihte þat dorst honde on him ligge
Bot if he swore he schole anone abegge
A þefe he was for soþe of corne and mele
And þat a sleigh  and vsand for to stele
His name was hoten deynous symkyne
A wife he had commen of Noble kinne
The parson of þe toune hir fadere was
Wiþe hire he ȝafe mony a panne of bras
For þat Simkin schold in his blode allye
Sche was yfostrede in a Nonnerye
ffor Simkin wold no wif as he seide
Bot sche were wele ynorissched and a maide
To saue his astate of ȝomanrye
And sche was proude and pert as a pye
A ful faire siht was it vppon hem tuo
On Halidaies beforne hire wolde he go


With his tepet wonden aboute his hede
And sche cam after in a gide of rede
And simkyn hadd hosen of þe same
Thare dorste no whiht clepen hire bot dame
Was none so hardy þat wente be þe weie
That dorste with hire ones rage or pleie
Bot if he wolde be sleine of Simkynne
Wiþ panade or wiþ knyf or wiþ Boydekynne
ffor Ielous folke bene perlous euer mo
Algates þei wolde here wives wenden so
And eke for sche was somdele smoterliche  
Sche was as deyne as water in a diche
As ful of Hokere and of bismare
Hir þouht þat a lady schold spare
What for hire kinred and hire Nortelrie
That sche had lerned in the Nonnerye
A douhter had þei betwexe hem two
Of twenty ȝere wiþouten any moo
Saueinge a childe þat was of halfe ȝere age
In cradel it ley and was a propur page
þis wenche þikke and wele ygroue was
wiþ Camois nose and eyen  grei as glasse
wiþ buttokes brode  and brestes rounde and hihe
Bot rihte faire was hire here I wil nouht lye
The parson of þe toune for sche was so faire
In purpos was to make hire his hayre
Boþe of his Catel and his Mesuage
And strange he maade it for hire Mariage
His purpos was to bestowe hire hye
In to somme worþi blode of Auncestrie
ffor holy cherche goode mot be despended
On holy cherche blode þat is descended
Therfore he wolde his holy blode honoure
þouhe þat holy cherche scholde deuoure
Grete soken haþe þis meller oute of doute
Wiþ wete and malte of al þe lande aboute


And namely þer was a grete College
Men clepen þe solier halle att Cantabregge
There was hir whete and eke his malte ygrounde
And on a daye it happide on a stounde
Seeke laie þe Maunciple on a Maledye
Men wenden wisly þat he scholde deye
ffor whiche þis meller stale boþe mele and corne
An hundreþ time more þan beforne

Bot nowe he was a þef outrageouly
ffor whiche þe wardeine chidde and made fare
Bot þereof sette þe Meller nouht a tare
He crakke bost and swore it was nouht soo
Than were þere ȝonge scolers tuo
That dwelten in þe hal of whiche I seye
Testif þei were and lusti for to pleie
And oonely for her mirþe and reuelrie  
Vppon þe wardeine besely þei crie
To ȝeue hem leue bot a litel stounde
To goone to melle and seen her corne  ygrounde
And hardely þei dorst leine her neke

Of corne ne be sleihte ne be force heme reue
And att þe laste þe wardeine ȝaf hem leue
Iohn hight þat one  and Aleyne hiht þat oþere
Of one towne were þei borne þat hiht stroþere

And att þe melne þe sakke adoune he laythe

And Iohn also howe nowe what do ȝe here

Or elles he is a foole as clerkes seine
Oure Maunciple I hope he wil be dede

And þerefore es I come and alswa Aleine
To grinde oure corne and carie it ham aȝeine

Wiþ lokkes blake ykempt ful fetisly
Daunce he couþe so wele and Iolyly

He was as ful of loue and paramour
As is þe hyve ful of hony swete
Wele was þe wenche wiþ him myht mete
Att euery bridel wolde he singe and hoppe
He loued bett þe tauerne þan his maistier schoppe
For whan þer any rydeinge was in chepe
Owte of þe schoppe þeder wolde he lepe
Til þat he hadde al þe siht yseyne
And daunced wele wolde he nouȝt come aȝeine
And gaderd him a Meyne of his sorte  
To hoppe and singe and maken swiche disporte
And þere þei setten steuen for to mete
To pleine att þe dys in suche a strete
For in þe toune was þere no prentis
Þat fairer couþe cast a paire of dis

 That fonde his Maister wele in his chaffare
For oft time he fonde his box ful bare
For sekurly a prentis reueloure

Al haue he not part of þe menstralcye
For þeft and ryot þei bene conuertible

Vpon a daie whan he his paper souht
Of a prouerbe þat seiþe þis same worde
Wele better is roten appel oute of horde
Than þat it rote al þe remenant
So fareþ it be a riotous seruant
It is full lasse harme to latt it passe
Þan he schende al þe seruantes in þe place
Tharefor his maister ȝaf him aquitance
And bad him go wiþ sorwe and wiþ meschaunce
And þus þis Iolif prentise had his leue
Nowe lat him riote al þe nyhte or leue
And for þere is no þef wiþowten a lowke
Þat helpeþ him to wasten and to sowke
Of þat he bribe can or borwe maye
Anone he sent his bedde and his araie
Vnto a Conper of his owen sorte
Þat loued dis and reuel and disporte
And had a wife þat helde for countinance
A schoppe and swyued for his sustenance
Fye þerone it is so foule I will nowe tell no forþere  
For schame of þe harlotrie þat seweþ after
A velany it were þareof more to spell
Bot of a knyhte and his sonnes My tale I wil forþe tell
And þerefore listeneþ and herkeneþ þis tale ariht
And ȝe schullen here of a douhte knyht
Sir Iohn of Boundys was his name
He couþe of nortur and muchel of game
þre sonnes þe knyht had and wiþ his body he hem wanne
The eldest was a muche schrewe and sone he beganne
His breþerne loued wele here fader and of him were agast
The eldest deserued his fader curs and had it att þe last
The good knyht his fadere leuede so ȝore
That deþe was commen him to and handeled him sore
The goode knyht cared sore seke þer he leye
How his children schold leuen after his deye
He had bue wide where bot no husbonde he was
All þe londe þat he had was verrey purchas
Fayne he wolde it were ydressed amonge hem al
That iche of hem miht have his parte as it wald fal
Tho sente he into Contre after wise knyhtes
To helpen delen his londes and drisse hem to rihtes
He sent hem worde by lettres þei scholden hihe belyue
If þei wolde speke wiþ him if þei were on lyue


Tho þe knyhtes herden seek þat he laye
Had þei no reste neyþer nyht nor daye
Til þei cam to hime þere he lay stille
On his deþ bede to abide goddes wille
Than seide þe good knyhte seke þere he lay
Lordes I ȝowe warne soþe wiþowten nay
I may no longer leue here on þis stonde
ffor þorwhe goddes will deþ draueþ me to grounde
Ther nas none of hem all þat herde him ariht
That þei hadden rewþe of þat ilke knyht
And seid sir for goddes loue ne dismay ȝowe nouht
God maye done bote of bale þat is nowe ywrouht
Than spake þe good knyht seeke þere he laie
Bote of bale god may sende I wote it is no naye
Bot I be seke ȝow knyhtes for þe loue of me
Goþ and dresseþ my londes amonge myne sonnes þre
And for þe loue of God deleþ hem nouht amys
And forȝete nouht Gamelyn my yonge son þat i
Takeþ hede to þat one as wele as to þe toþer  
Selde ȝe see any heire helpen his broþer
Tho lete þei þe knyht lyen þat was nouht in hele
And wenten in to counseil his londes for to dele
ffor to delen hem al to one þat was here þouhte
And for gamelin was ȝongest he schold haue nouht
All þe londe þat þere was þei dalten it in tuo
And leten Gamelyn þe ȝonge wiþowten lande go
And iche of hem seide to oþere ful loude
His breþerne mow ȝeuen him londe whan he goode coude
Whan þei hadde deled þe lond att þeire will
They comen to þe knyht þere he laie ful still
And tolde him anone howe þei had wrouht
And þe knyht þere he laie liked it riht nouht
 Than seide þe knyht be seinte Martine
ffor al þat ȝe haue done ȝit is þe londe myne
ffor goddes loue neyboures stondeþ al still
And I will delen my londe riht after my will


Iohn myne eldest son schal haue ploues fiue
þat was my faders heritage while he was on lyue
And my Meddelest son fiue plowhes of londe
That I helpe for to geten wiþ my riht honde
And al myn oþere purchas of londes and of ledes
That I bequethe Gamelyne and al my goode stedes
And I beseeke ȝowe good men þat lawe conne of londe
ffor Gamelyn loue þat my quest stonde
 Thus dalte þe knyht his londe be his daye
Riht on his deþe bed seke þere he laye
And sone afterward he laye stone still
And deide whan time came as it was cristes will
Anone as he was dede and vnder gars graue
Sone þe alder broþer giled þe ȝonge knaue
And toke into his honde his londe and his lede
And Gamelin him selfe to cle and to fede
He cloþed him and fedde yuel and eke wroþe
And lete his for fare and his houseȝ bothe
His Parkes and his wodes and dide no þinge wel
And seþþen he it abouhte on his faire fel
So longe was Gamelin in his broþers hall
ffor þe strongest of good will þei douten him all
Ne was þere none þerinne ȝonge ne olde
That wold wreþþe ware he neuer so bolde
 Gamelyn stode vp on a daie in his broþere ȝerde  
And began wiþ his honde to handel his berde
He þouhte on his londes þat layen vnsawe
And his faire Okes þat doune were drawe
His parkes were broken and his dere reuede
Of all his goode stedes was none him beleuede
His howses weren vnhelde and ful yuel ydiht
Tho þouht Gamelyn it wente nouht ariht
Afterwarde cam his broþer walkinge þere
And seide to Gamelin is oure mete ȝere
þo him wreþþed Gamelyn and suore be goddes boke
Thou schalt go bake þi selfe I wil nouȝt be þi koke


Howe broþer Gamelyn howe answeres þou nowe
Thou spak neuer suche a worde as þou dost nowe
Be my faiþe seide Gamelin now me þenkeþ nede
Of al þe harmes that I haue I toke neuer are hede
My parkes bene broken and myn dere be reuede
Of myne armoure and my stedes nouht is me beleued
Al þat my ffader me bequathe al goþe to schame
And þerfor haue þou goddes curse broþer be þi name
 Than bespakke his broþer þat rape was of rees
Stond still gedelinge and hold riht þi pes
Thou schalt be faine for to haue þi mete and þi wede
What spekest þou gamelin of londe or of lede
Than seide Gameline þe childe þat was ȝinge
Cristes curs mot he haue þat clepeþ m gedelinge
I am no wers gadelyn ne no wers whyght
Bot borne of lady and geten of a knyht
Ne dorste he nouht to Gamelyin neere a fote go
Bot cleped to him his men and seide to hem þo
Goþe and bete þis boye and reueþ him his witte
And lat him leren anoþer time to answere me bitte
Than seide þe childe ȝonge Gamelyn
Cristes curs most þou haue broþer art þou myne
And if schal algate be beten anone
Cristes curs must þou haue bot þou be þat one
And anon his broþer in þat grete hete
Made his men to fet staues Gamelin for to bete
Whan euery of hem had a staf ynome
Gamely was war þoo he sey hem comen
Tho Gamelyn seye hem com he loked ouere all
And was ware of a pestel stondeinge vnder a wall
Gamelyn was liht and þeder gan he lepe  
And droue al his breþes men riht on an hepe
He loked as wilde lyon and leide on good wone
Tho his broþer sawhe þat þei began to gone
He fleyhe vpe intil a lofte and schotte þe dore fast
Thus Gamelyn with his pestel made hem al agast


Som for for Gamelines loue and somme for his eye
Al þei drouhe be halues whan he began to pleye
What nowe seide Gamelin yeuel mot ȝe þe
Wil ȝe beginne contik and so sone flye
Gamelin souht his broþere whider he was flowe
And sawh where þat he loked oute at a windowe
Broþer seide Gamelyn come a litel nere
And I wil teche a pleie att þe bokelere
His broþer him ansewarde and swore be seint Richere
While þe pestel is in þi honde y come þe no nere
Broþer I wil make þi pees I swere be goddes ore
Cast awaie þi Pestel and wraþþe þe nomore
I mot nede seide Gamelyne wraþþe me att ones
ffor þou wolde make þi men breke my bones
Ne had I had maine and miht in boþe myn armes
To fende hem from me þei wolde haue done me armes
Gamelin seide his broþere be þou nouht wroþe
ffor to seen þe haue harme me were riht loþe
I ne dide it nouht broþer but for a fondeinge
ffor to loken if þoue were stronge and art so ȝynge
Come adoune þan to me and graunt me my bone
Of þinge I will þe axen and we schal sauhte sone
 Doune þan cam his broþer þat fikel was and fel
And was riht sore agast of þe pestel
He seide broþer Gameline ax me þi bone
And loke þou me blame bot I it graunt þe sone
Than seide Gamelyin broþe ywis
And we schol bene att one þou most me graunt þis
All þat my fader me bequaþe while he was on lyue
Þou most do me it haue if we scholl nouht striue
That schalt þou haue Gamelyn I swere be goddes ore
Al þat þi fader þe bequaþe þouhe þou woldest haue more
Thi londe þat lieþ ley wele it schal be sowe
And þin house reised vpe þat ben leide so lowe
Thus seide þe knyht to Gameline be mowþe
And þouht of falsenes as he wele couþe


The knyht þouht on treson and Gamelin þouht none  
And went and kissed his broþer And whan þei weren att one
Alas ȝonge Gamelyne no þinge he ne wiste
With suche false treson his broþer him kyst
Lysten and lythes and holdeþ ȝoure tonge
And ȝe schal here talkeinge of Gamelin þe ȝonge
Ther was þere beside cride a wrastlinge
And þer for þere was sette a rame and a ringe
And Gamelyn was in wil to wende þer to
ffor to prouen his myht what he couþe do
Broþere seide Gameline be seint Richere
Thou moste lene me to nyht a litel coursere
þat is frische to þe spores on for to ride
I moste on an herande a litel here beside
Be god seide his brþer of stedes in my stal
Go and chese þe þe best and spare none of al
Of stedes or of couurseres þat stoden hem beside
And tel me good broþer wheder þou wilt ride
Here beside broþer is cried a warstelinge
And þer for schal be sett a ram and a rynge
Meche worschipe it were broþe to us alle
Might I þe ramme and þe ringe bringe home to þis halle
A stede þere was sadeled smerly and skete
Gamelin dide a paire of spores faire on his fete
He sete fote in þe sterep þe stede he bestrode
And towarde þe wrastelinge þe ȝin childe rode
Tho Gamelin þe ȝonge was reden oute att þe gate
The false knyht his broþer lokked it after þate
And besouht Ihesu crist þat is heuen kinge
He myht breke his neke in þat wrestlinge
As sone as Gamelin cam þer þis place was
He liht doune of his stede and stode on þe gras
And þere herde a frankelein walawaie singe
And began bitterly his hondes to wringe
Gode man seide Gamelin whi makes þou þis fare
Is þer no man þat maie ȝow helpen oute of þis care


Alas seide þis frankelein þat euer was I bore
ffor twey stalworþ sonnes I wene þat I haue lore
A champion is in þe place þat me haþ wrowht sorwe
ffor he haþ sleine my twey sonnes bot if god hem borwe
I wil ȝeue ten pounde be ihesu crist and more
Wiþe þe nones I fand a man to halden him sore
Gode man seide Gamelin wilt þou wele done  
Hold myn hors while my man draweþ of my schone
And help my man to kepe my cloþes and m stede
And I wil into þe place gone to loke if I mai spede
Be god seide þe frankelein it schal be wele done
I wil my self be þi man to drawen of þi schone
And wende þou into þe place ihesu crist þe spede
And drede nouȝt of þi cloþes ne of þi goode stede
Barfor and vngert Gamelin inne cam
All þat were in þe place hede of him þei name
Howe he dorste auntre him on him to done his myht
That was so dowhti a champion in wrastelinge and in fiht
Vp stert þe Champion rapely anone
Toward ȝonge Gamelin he began to gone
And seide who his fader and who is þi sire
For soþe þou arte a grete fole þat þou com hire
Gamelione ansewarde þe champion þoo
Thow knewe wele my fader while he couþe goo
Whiles he was on live be seint Martine
Sir Iohōn of Boundes was his name and I Gamelyne
ffelaw seide þe champion so mot I þriue
I knewe wele þi fader while he was on lyue
And þi selfe gamelyne I wil þat þou it here
While þoue were a ȝonge boye a muche schrewe þu were
Than seide Gamelyn and swore be cristes ore
Now I am alder wax þou schalt finde me a more
Be god seide þe champion welcom mot þou be
Come þou ones in myne honde schalt þou neuer þe
It was wele wiþinne þe nyht and þe mone schone
Whan Gameline and þe champion togeder gonne gone


The Champion kast tornes to Gamelin þat was prest
And Gamelin stode stil and bad him done his best
Than seide Gamelin to þe Champeoun
Thou ert fast aboute to bringe me doune
Nowe haue I prouede many tornes of þine
Þou mot he seide fele on or tuo of myne
Gamelyn to þe champeon ȝed smartly anone
Of al þe turne þat he couþe he schewde him bot one
And kest on þe left side þat þre ribbes tobrake
And þereto his one harme þat ȝaf a grete crake
Than seide Gamely smertly anone
Schal it be hold for cast or elles for none
Be god saide þe champion weþer þat it be  
He þat comes ones in þine hande schal he neuer þe
Than seide þe frankelein þat had his son þere
Blissed be þu Gamelin þat euer þou borne were
The frankeleine seide to þe champion on him stode him none eye
This is ȝonge Gamelyn þat tauht þe þis pleie
Aȝeine anseward þe champion þat liked no þinge well
He is alþer maister and his pleie is riht fell
Seþþe I wrasteled first it is go ȝore
Bot was neuer my lif handeled so sore
Gamelin stode in þe place alone wiþouten serk
And seide if þere be mo let hem come to werk
The Champioun þat payned him to wirche so sore
It semeþ be his countenance þat he wil no more
    
    
    
ffor he handeled þe champion so wonderly sore
Two gentil men ȝemed þe place
Cam to gamelin god ȝeue him gode grace
And seide to him do on þin hosen and þin schone
ffor soþe att þis time þe faire is done
And þan seid Gamelin so mot I wele fare
I haue nouȝt ȝit haluendel solde my ware


Tho seide þe Champion so brouke I my swere
He is a foole þat þerof byeþ þou selles it so dere
Tho seide þe frankelen þat was in muche care
ffelawe he saide whi lakkes þou his ware
Be seinte Iame in Galeys þat mony man haþ souht
Ȝit it is to goode chepe þat þou hast bought
Tho þat wardeins were of þe warstelinge
Come and brouht Gamelin þe Ram and þe ringe
And seide haue Gamelin þe ringe and þe Ram
ffor þe best warstelier þat euer here cam
Thus whanne Gamelin þe ramme and þe Ringe
And went wiþ muche Ioy home in þe Morneinge
 His Broþer seyhe where he came wiþ þe grete route
And bad schette þe gate and holde him wiþoute
Te porter of his lorde was sore agast
And stert anone to þe gate and lokked it fast
Now liþeþ and listeneþ boþ ȝonge and olde
And ȝe schal her gamen of Gameline þe bolde
Gamelin cam to þe gate for to haue commen in
And þan was it schot fast wiþ a pin
Than seide Gamelin Portier vndo þe gate
ffor mony goode mannes son stonden þerate
Than anseward þe portier and swore be goddes berd  
Þou ne schalt Gamelin com in to þis ȝerde
Thou lixt said Gamelin so brouke I my chinne
He smote þe wiket wiþe his fote and brak awaie þe pinne
The portier sauhe þo it myht no beter bee
He sette foote on erþe and gan for to flee
Be my faiþe seid Gamelin þat trauel is lorene
ffor I am as liht on fote as þou if þat þou haddest it sworne
Gamely ouer toke þe portere and his teen wrake
And girt him in þe neke þat he began to brake
And toke him be þat on arme and þrewe him in a welle
Vij faþem it was depe as I haue herd telle
Whan Gamelin the ȝonge þus had plaide his plaie
All þat in þe ȝerde were drowen hem awaie


They dreden him ful sore for þe werke þat he wrouht
An þe faire compaignie þat he þeder brouht
Gameline ȝede to þe ȝate and lete it vp wide
He lete in al þat gone wolde or ride
And seide ȝe be welcom witheouten any greue
ffor we will bue Maistres here and aske noman leue
Ȝisterdaic I left seide ȝonge gamelyne
In my broþer seler five tun of wyne
I wil nouȝt þis company parten a twynne
And ȝe wil done after me whan any sope is þereinne
And if my broþer gruche or make foul chiere
Othere for spence of mete and drink þat we spende here
I am oure Catur and bereþ oure aller purse
He schal haue for his grucheinge seint Maries curse
Mi broþer is a negon I swere be cristes ore
And we wil spende largely þat we haue spent ȝore
And who þat makeþ grucchinge þat we here duelle
He schal vnto þe drawe welle
Vij daies and seuen nyht Gamelin helde his fest
Wiþþe muche solas was þer and none chest
In a litul ture turet his broþer steke
And sawehe him waste his goode bot dorst he nouȝt spek
Erly on a morneynge on þe viij daie
The gestes cam to Gamelin and wolde gone here waie
Lorde seide Gamelin wil ȝe soo hihe
All þe wyne is nouht ȝit dronken so brouke I myn eye
Gamelin in his hert was ful woo
Whan his gestes toke here leue fro him for to goo
He wolde þei had duelled longer and þei seide naye  
Bot betauht Gamelyn god and goode daye
Thus made Gamelin his fest and brouht wele to ende
And after his gestes had take leue to wende
    
    
    
    

 And all þe while þat Gamelyne helde his mangeri
His broþere þouht on him be wreke wiþ his trecheri
Whan Gamelin gestes were reden and gone
Gamelyne stode þan alone frende had he none
Tho afterwarde ful sone wiþinne a litel stonde

fforþe cam þe false knyht oute of selere
To gamelin his broþer he ȝode ful nere
And seide to Gamelin who maade þe so bolde

Broþer seide Gamelin wraþþe þe riht nouht
ffor it is mony day gone seþþe it was bouht
ffor broþer þou hast had be seint Richere
Of xv plowhes of londe þis xvj ȝere
And of al þe bestes þou hast forþe bredde
Þat my fader me quaþe on his dede bedde
Of al þis xvj ȝere I ȝeue þe prowe
ffor þe mete and þe drinke þat we han spende nowe
Than seide þe false knyhte þere yuel mot he þe
Herken broþer Gamelin what I wil ȝeue þe

I will make þe my eire I swere be seint Iohn
Par ma faye seide Gamelin and it so be
And þou þinke as þou seiste god ȝelde it þe
No thinge wist Gamelin of his broþers gile
Therefor he was begilede in a litel while
Gamelyn seide he o þinge I þe tell
Tho þou þrewe my porter in to þe drawe well
I swore in þat wraþþe and in þat grete mote
That scholdest be bounden boþe honde and fote
Therfore I þe beseche broþe Gameline
Lat me nouȝt be forsworne broþer art þou myne
Lat me binde þe boþ honde and foote

Brother seide Gamelin so mot I þe
Þou schalt not be forsworne for þe loue of me


Tho maad þei Game to sitte myht he nouht stonde
Til þei hadde him bowden boþe fote and honde
The false knyht his broþer of Gamelin was agast  
And sent affeter fetters to fetterne him fast
His broþer maade lesinges on him þer he stode
And tolden hem þat comen inne þat Gamelin was woode
Gamelin sto a post bounden in þe hall
Þo þat comen In  loked on him all
Euer stode Gamelin euen vpriht
Bot mete and drinke hadde ne none neyþer daye ne nyht
Than seide Gameline broþer be my halse
Nowe I haue aspyede þou ert a party false
Had I wist þat treson þat þou hast founde
I wolde haue ȝeue strokes ar I hadde be bounde
Gamelin stoode bounden still as any stone
Two daies and two nyhtes mete hade he none
Þan seide Gamelin þat stode ybounde stronge
Adam spenser me þinke I fast to longe
Adam spenser now I beseche þe
ffor þe muche loue my fader loued þe
If þou maie come to cayes lesse me oute of bonde
And I wil parte wiþe þe of my fre londe
Than seide Adam þat was þe spensere
I haue serued þi broþer þis xvj ȝere
If I lete gone oute of his boure
He wolde sei afrward I were a traitoure
Adam seide Gamelin so brouke I myn hals
Thou schalt finde my broþe att last riht fals
Therefore Adam broþer lese oute of bondes
And I will part wiþ þe of my fre londes
Vp suche forwarde Adam Iwisse
I wil do þerto al þat me is
Adam seide Gamelin as mot I þe
I wil halde þe couenant and þou wil me
Anone as Adam lorde to bed was gone
Adam toke þe kaye and lete Gamelin oute anone


He vnlokked Gamelin boþe hondes and fete
In hope of avauncement þat he him behete
Than seide Gamelin þonkede be goddes sonde
Now I am louse boþe fote and honde
Had I nowe eten and dronken ariht
Þere is none in þis hous schold binde me þis nyht
Adam toke Gamelin stil as any stone
And ladde him into þe spence rapeli anone
And set him to soper riht in a priue stede  
And badd him do gladly  and Gamelin so dede
Anone as Gameline had ete wel and fine
Therto he dronke wele of þe rede wine
Adam seide Gamelin what is nowe þi rede
Where I go to my broþer and gerde of his hede
Gamelyn seide Adam it schal nouhte be so
I kan teche þe a rede þat is worþe tuo
I wote wele for soþe þat þis is no naie
We schal haue a maungeri riht on sonondaye
Abbotes and priours mony her schal be
And oþer men of holy cherche as I tell þe

And I schal leue þeim vnloke þat awaye þou maie hem cast
Whan þat þei haue eten and wasschen her hondes
Thou schalt beseke hem al to bringe þe oute of bondes
And if þei will borwe þe þat were good gamme
Þan were oute of prison  and I owte of blame
And if iche of hem seie to vs naie

Thou schalt haue a goode staf and I wil haue anoþer
And cristes curs þat on haue þat faileþ þe tother
Ȝe for god seid Gamelin I saie it for me
If I faile on my side yuel mot I þe
If we schol algate assoile hem of her sinne
Warne me broþe Adam whan we schal beginne
Gamelin seide Adam be seinte charite
I wil warne þe beforne whan it schal be


Whan I twynke on þe loke for to gone
And cast awaie þi fetters and com to me anone
Adam seide Gamelin blissed be þi bones
That is a good counsel ȝiuen for þe nones
If þei werne me to bringe me oute of bendes
I wil sett good strokes riht on here lendes
Tho þe sondaie was comen and folk to þe feste
ffaire þei were welcome boþe lest and meste
And euer as þei att þe hall dore cam inne
Thei keste þeire eye on ȝonge Gameline
The false knyht his broþer and ful of trecherie
Al þe gestes þat þer were att þe Mangerie
Of Gamelyn his broþer he tolde hem be mouþe
Al þe harme and þe schame þat he telle couþe
Whan þei were serued of mete iche mese after oþe  
Than seid Gamelin howe serue ȝe me þat am ȝoure broþe
It is nouht wele serued be god þat al maade
Þat I schal sitt fastinge and oþer men maak glade
Þe false knyht his broþer þer þat he stode
Told al his gestes þat Gamelyne was woode
And Gamelin stode still and anseward nouht
Bot Adames wordes he held in his þouht
Tho Gamelin gan spek dolfoly wiþ all
To þe grete lordes þat saten in þe hall
Lordes he seide for cristes passione
Helpe to bringe Gamelin oute of prisone

That þe oute of prison beggeþ oþer borwe
Bot euer worþe him wele þat doþ þe muche sorwe
Affter þat Abbot þan spak anoþer
I wolde þin hede wer of þouh þou were my broþer
Al þat þe borwe foul mote þaym fall
Thus þei seiden al þat weren in þe all
Than seide A prioure yuel mote he þriue
It is muche sorwe and scaþe boþe þat þou art a liue


 Nowe seide Gamelin so brouke I my bone
Nowe I haue aspied þat frendes haue I none
Cursed mot he worþe boþe flesche and blode
Þat euere doþe Priour or Abbot any goode
Adam þe spencer toke vp þe cloþe
And loked vpon Gamelin  and sawhe þat he was wroþe
Adam on þe Pantri litel he þouht
Bot tuo goode staues to hall dore he brouht
Adam loked on gamelin  and he was war anone
And keste awaye þe fetteres and began to gone
Tho he cam to Adam he toke þe toke þe to staf
And began to wirche and goode strokes ȝaf
Gameline cam into þe hall and þe spenser boþe
And loked hem aboute as þei had be riht wroþe
Gamelin sprengeþ holy water with an oken spire
Than sum þat stod vp right ffellen in þe fire
Ther was no lewe man þat in þe hall stode
That wolde do Gamelin any þinge bot gode
Bot stoden be side and lete boþe worche
ffor þei had no rewþe of men of holy cherche
Abbot or priour Monke or Chanoune  
That Gamelin ouere toke anone þei ȝeden downe
Thar was none of hem al þat wiþ his staf mette
Þat he ne maade hem ouer þrowe  and qwite hem his dette
Gamelin seide Adam for seint Charite
Pay good liuere for þe loue of me
And I kepe þe dore so euer her y masse
Er þei bene assoiled schal þer non passe
Dowte þe nouht seide Gamelin while we ben in fere
Kepe þou wel þe dore and I wirche here
Stere goode Adam and latt þere none fle
And we schol tel largely hou mony þer be
Gamelin seide Adam do hem bot goode
Thei bue men of holy cherche drawe of hem no blode
Saue wele þe croune  and done hem none harmes
Bot breke boþe here legges and sithen here armes


Thus Gamelin and Adam wrouht riht fast
And pleiden wiþe þe monkes and made hem agast
Theder þei cam rideinge Ioly with swaynes
And home aȝeine þei weren ledde in cartes and in waynes
Tho þei hadden al ydo þo saide a graie frere
Alas sir Abbot what did we nowe here
Tho þat we comen hider it was a colde rede
Vs had be better att home wiþ water and brede
While Gamelin gaf ordres to monk and to frere
Euer stod his broþer and mad foul chere
Gamelin vp wiþþe his staf þat he wel knewe
And gerd him in þe nekke þat he ouer þrewe
A litel aboue þe gardel þe rigge bot tobrast
And in þe fetters sette him þer he satt arst
Sitt þer broþer broþer seide Gameline

Al þe seruantȝ serued ham of þe best lawe
The schirreue was þen bot v mile
And al þis was tolde him in a litel while

Bounden and wounden men aȝein þe kinges pes
Tho began son striff for to wake
And þe scherref aboute gameline for to take
 Nowe lyþes and listeneþ so god gif ȝow good fine  
And ȝe schall here good game of ȝonge Gameline

Thei hiden fast wolde þei nouht linne
To þei cam to þe gate þer Gamelin was inne
Thei knokken on þe gate þe porter was nyhe
And loked out att an hole as a man þat was slyhe


The porter had beholde hem a litel while

A good Cart staf in his honde he hent

Adam felde tweine and Gameline felled þre
Þe toþer sett fete on erþe and gan to fle
What saide Adam so euer here I masse  
I haue riht goode wyne drinke ar ȝe passe


Naie be god seide þei þi drinke is not goode

Gamelin stoode still and loked him aboute
And sawhe þe scherreue come wiþ a grete route

Here comeþ þe scherreue and wil haue oure hedes
Adam seide to Gamelin my rede is nowe þis
Abide we no longer lest we fare a mys

Better is þer louse þan in toune bounde
Adam toke be þe honde ȝonge gamelin
And eyþer of hem dranke a drauht of wyne
And after token her cours and wenten her waie
Tho fonde þe scherref nest bot no naie
Þe scherref lyht doune And went in to þe hall
And fonde þe lorde fetterd fast wiþ all
The scherreve vnfetterd him riht sone anone
And sent after a leche to helen his rigge bone
Late we nowe þe false knyht lyhe in his care
And talke we of Gamelin and loke howe he fare
Gamelin in to þe wode stalkeþ still
And Adam spencer loked riht ill
Adam swore to Gamelin be seinte Richere
Nowe I se it is mery to be a spensere
That me were leuer kaye to bere
Than walken in þis wilde wode my cloþe to tere
Adam seide Gameline dismaie ȝe riht nouht
Many good mannes childe in care is brouht
As þei stode talkinge boþe in fere
Adam herde talkinge of men and nyhe hem þouht he were
Tho Gamelin vnder wode loked ariht
Vij score of ȝonge men he sawe wele adiht

And þo he sauhe mete he was glade ynowhe
ffor he hope to god for to haue his dele
And he was sore alonged after a goode mele
As he had seide þat word þe Maister outelawe  
Sawe Gamelin and Adam vnder wode schawe
Ȝonge men seide þe maister be þe goode rode
I am war of gestes god send vs goode

Be seinte Iame seid Adam what harme þat I gete

Gamelin and Adam wenten forþe in fere
And þei grete þe maister þat þei fonde þere

Sire we walke nouht here men harme to do

And bene harde bestade vnder wode linde
Of Gamelyne wordes þe maister had reuþe
He seide sche schal haue Inouhe haue god my treuþe
He bad hem sette doune for to take rest  
And bad ete and dringe and þat of þe best
As þei eten and dronken wele and fine
Than seide þe tone to þe toþer þis is Gameline
Tho was þe Maister owtelawe into counseile nome
And tolde howe it was Gamelin was þeder come
Anone as he herde howe it was befal
He maade him maister vnder him ouere hem al
Wiþinne þe þred weke him cam tidynge
Tho þe maister owtlawe þat was here kinge
Þat he scholde come home his pes was made
And of þe goode tiþinge he was ful glade
Tho seide he to his ȝonge men soþe to tell

Tho was Gameline anone wiþoute taryinge
Maade Maister owteley  and crouned here kinge
Tho was Gamelin crounede kinge of outelawes
And walked a while vnder wode schawes
The false knyht his broþer was scherreue of þe schire
And lete his broþer endite for hate and for ire
Tho were his bondemen sori and nouht gladde
Whan Gamelin her lorde was cried wolueshed and maade
And sent oute of his men wher þei myht him finde

To tel him tiþinge þe winde was went

Nowe is þi broþe scherreue and haþe þe baille
And haþe enditede þe and wolueshed doþe þe crie
Allas seide Gamelin þat euer I was so slakke
Þat I ne hadde broke his nekke  þo I his rigge brakke
Go greteþ wele myne husbondes and wif

Gamelyn cam wel redy to þe next schire
And þer was his broþer boþe lorde and sire

And put adoune his hode amonge þe lordes all

Bot brokebakke scherreue yuel most þou þe
Whi haste þou do me þat schame and velanye  
ffor to late endite me and wolueshede do me crye
Tho þouht þe fals knyht for to be awreke
And lete take Gameline most he nomore speke
Miht þere be no grace bot Gamelin att þe last
Was cast in to prison and fetterd fast
Gameline haþe a broþer þat hiht sir Ote
A goode knyht and hende as miht gone on fote
Anone ȝede a messagier to þat good knyht
And tolde hem al togeder howe Gameline was diht
    
He was riht sorie was he noþinge liht
    
And to his tweine breþer ful sone he came
Sir seide sir Ote to þe Scherref þoo

Til þe next siteinge of deliuerance
And lat þat Gamelin stonde to his chaunce

Bot he be redi whan þe Iustice sitte
Þou schalt bere þe Iuggement for all þi grete witte

Lat do liuer him anone and tak him to me
Tho was Gameline deliuerde to sir Ote his broþer
And þat nyht dwelden þe tone wiþ þe toþere
On þe morwe seide Gamelin to sir Ote þe hende
Broþe he seide I mot for soþe fro þe wende
To loke how my ȝonge men leden here lif
Wheþer þei leuen in ioye or elles in strif
Be gode seide sir hote þat is a colde rede
Now I see þat al þe carke schal fal on myne hede
ffor whan þe Iustice sitte and þou be nouht yfounde

Broþer seide Gamelin dismaie þe nouht

I wil be þere redy whan þe Iustice sitte
Than seide sir Ote til gamelin god schelde þe fro schame
Com whan þou seest time and bringe vs oute of blame
    
    
 Gamelin went þo vnder wode rise
And fonde þere playinge men of prise
Tho was ȝonge Gamelin riht glad ynouhe
Whanne he fonde his men vnder woode bouhe
Gamelin and his men talken in fere
And þei had good Game here maister to here


His men tolden him of aventures þat þei had founde
And Gamelin hem tolde aȝein howe he was fast bounde
Whan Gamelin was outelawe he hadde no cors
Ther was no man þat for him ferde þe wors
Bot Abbotes and priours and monke and chanone
On hem left he nouht whan he myht hem nome
While Gamelin and his men made merþes rive
The fals knyht his broþer yuel most he þriue
ffor he was fast aboute boþe daie and oþer
ffor to hire þe queste for to honge his broþer
 Gamelin stode vpon a daie and he behelde

Þat he wolde be redy whan þe Iustice sette
He þouht wele þat he wolde wiþoute delaie
Com afor þe Iustice to kepen his daye
And seide to his ȝonge men diht ȝowe ȝare

And my broþer for me to prison schal be nomme
Be seint Iame seide his ȝonge men and þou reede þerto

While Gameline was cominge þer þe Iustice satt

To hire men on his queste to hangen his broþer
Þouhe þei had nouht þe tone he wolde haue þat oþere
Tho cam Gamelin fro vnder wode rise
And brouht wiþe hem ȝonge men of prise
I se wele saide Gamelin þe Iustice is sette
Go aforne Adam and loke how it spette
Adam went in to þe hall and loke al aboute
He sawhe þere stand lordes grete and stoute
And sir Ote his broþere fetterd ful faste  
Tho went Adam oute as he were agaste
Adam seide to Gamelin and to his felawes all

Ȝonge men seide Gamelin þis here ȝe alle

If god ȝife vs grace wele for to do

And þe Iustice boþe þat is þe Iugge man
And þe scherreue boþe þoruh him it beganne

Nowe is þi power done þou most nedes arise

Bot þroue him ouer þe barre and his arme tobrak
Dorst none to Gameline seie bot gode

Gamelin set him doune in þe Iustice sete
And sir Ote his broþer by him and Adam att his fete
Herke of bourde þat Gamelin dede

 He lete fetter þe Iustice and his false broþer
And lete hem come to þe barre þe tone wiþ þe toþer
Tho Gamelin had þus done he no rest
To he had enquered who was on þe quost
ffor to demen his broþer sir Ote for to honge
Or he wiste whiche þei were he þouht ful longe
Bot as son as Gamelin wist where þei were
He dide hem euerychon fetter in fere
And bringe hem to þe barre and sett hem on rewe
Be my faiþe seide Iustice þe scherreue is a schrewe
Than seide Gamelin to þe Iustice
Thou hast ȝeue domes of þe werst assise
And þe xij sisours þat weren on þe queste
Thei schal ben anhanged þis daie so haue I goode reste
Than seide þe scherreue to ȝonge Gameline
Lorde I crie þe Mercye broþe art þou myne
Therfore seide Gamelin haue þou goddes curs

ffor to make schort tale and nouht to longe
He ordeyned him a queste of his men so stronge
The Iustice and þe scherreve boþ hongede hihe
To veyven wiþe þe ropes  and wiþ þe wynde drye
And þe xij sisours sorwe haue þei þat rekke
All þei were hanged fast be þe nekke
Thus endeþ þe false knyht wiþ his trecherie
That euer hade ladde his lif in falsnes and in folye


He was hongede be þe nekke and nouht be þe purce
Þat was þe mede þat he had for his fader curs
Sire Ote was eldest and Gamelin was ȝinge
Wente wiþ here frendes and pesed wiþ þe kinge
Thei made pes wiþ þe kinge of þe best sise
The kinge louede wele sir Ote and maade him Iustice
And after þe kinge maade Gamelin boþe in est and weste
Chief Iustice of his fre forest
All his whight ȝonge men þe kinke forȝaue here gelte  
And siþen in good Office he haþe hem al pelte
Thus wan Gamelin his londe and his lede
And wrake him of his enemys and quyte hem here mede
And sir Ote his Broþer maade him hi heire
And seþþe wede Gameline a wif a goode and a feire
Thei leueden togeder while þat crist wolde
An syþen was Gamelin Grauen vnder molde
And so schal we al maie þere none fle

Of Aprill þat is messagiere of maie
And sawhe wele þat þe schadow of euery tree

Owre Emperour of Rome Gode him see  
A douhter he haþe þat sen þe werlde beganne

In hir is hihe beaute wiþ oute pride

To al hire werkes vertue is hir gyde
Humblesse haþe slayne in ȝowe al tyranny

And whan þei han þis blisseful Maiden seine

And leuen in wele I can say ȝow no more
 Nowe fel it þat þese marchantz stoden in grace
Of him þat was Souldan of Surrye

Make hem good chiere and besilye aspye

Þat þis souldan haþ kauht so grete plesance
To hane hir figure in his remembrance
And al his lust and al his besy cure

Of Sampson turnus and of Socrates
The deþ bot mennus wittes bene so dulle

And schortly of þis matier for to passe

And certeigne gold I not what quantite

And notified is þoruhe oute þe toune

Of olde bretons dwelynge in þis Isle
Ther was hire refute for þe mene while
 Bot ȝit was neuer cristen bretons so exiled
Þat þer nas sum in hir priuete
Honoured crist and heyþen folk begiled
And nyhe þe castel þer dwel þer dwelden þre
Þat one of hem was blinde and myht nouht see

Wiþ wiche men seen after þat þei be blinde
 Briht was þe sonne as in þe somers daie
ffor whiche þe Constable and his wif also
And Constance hane ytake þe riht waie
Towarde þe se a forlonge way or tuo
To pleyen and to Romen to and fro
And in her waie blende men þaie mette
Croked and olde wiþ fast eyen schett
 In þe name of criste cried þis blinde bretoune
Dame Ermenilda ȝeue me my sihte aȝeine
This lady wex affrayde of þe soune
Lest hir husbonde schortly for to seyne
Wolde hir for ihesu cristes loue haue sleyne
Til Constance made hir bolde and bad hire wirche
The wil of criste as douhter of his chirche
  
 The Constable wex abassched of þat siht
And seide what amounteþ al þis fare
Custance anseward it is cristes miht  
Þat helpeþ folke oute of þe fendes snare
And so ferforþe sche gan oure laye declare
Þat sche constable ar þat it was eue
Conuerteþ and on criste maad him beleue
 This Constable was nouht lorde of þis place
Of whiche I spak þare he constance fonde
Bot keped it stronge mony a winter space
Vnder Allea kynge of of Northehumbrelonde
    
Aȝein þe scottes as men may wele here
Bot torne I wil aȝeine to my matier
 Sathan þat euer waiteþ vs to begile
Sauhe of Custance al hir perfeccioun
And kast anone howe he myht white hir while
And maad a ȝonge knyht þat dwelleþ in þe toune
Loue hire so hote of foule affeccione
Þat verraily him þouht þat he scholde spille
Bote of hir myht ones haue his wille
 He woweþe hir bot it aveileþ nouht
Sche wolde do no sinne be no weie
And for dispite he compassed in his þouht
To make hir a schameful deþe to deye
He waiteþ whan þe Constable was awaie
And priuely on a nyhte he crepte
In Ermenilda scambur whiles þat sche sleped
 Wery forwaked in hire orisons
Slepeþ custance and Ermenilde also
Þis knyht þouht to performe sathanas temptacions
Al softly he is to þe bedde go
  
And kette þe þrote of Ermenylde a tuo
And leide þe blody knyf be dam Custance
And wente his weie þere god ȝiue him meschaunce
 Sone affter comeþ þis Constable aȝeine
And Eke Allea þe kenge þat was of þis lande
And sauhe his wyf dispitously sleyne
ffor whiche ful of oft he wepet and wronge his honde
And in þe bedde þe blody knyfe he fonde
Be dam Custance Alas what myht sche seye
ffor verre woo hir witte was al awaie
 To Kinge Alla was tolde al þis meschance
And eke þe time and where and in what wise
Þat in a schip was founden þis Constance
As ȝe haue herde toforne devise  
The kinges herte of pite gan agrise
Whan he seþe so benyngne a creature
ffal in disese and in mesauenture
 ffor as þe lambe towarde towarde his deþe is brouht
So stant þis Innocent befor þe kenge
This fals knyht þat haþe þis treson wrouht
Bereþ hir on honde þa sche haþe don þis þinge
Bot naþeles þer was grete Morneinge
Amonge þe peple and sei þe can not gesse
That sche had done so grete a wikkenesse
 ffor þei haue sene hir euer so vertuous
And loueinge ermenilde riht as hir lif
Of þis bare wittenes eueryche in þat house

This Gentil kinge haþe cauht a grete motif
Of þis wittenes And þouht he wolde enquere
Depper in þis caas he troueþ for to lere
  
 Alas Constance þou naste no champioun
Ne fiht cans tow nouht so walawaie
Bot he þat for oure redempcioun
And bonde Sathan and lythe ȝit þere he laye
So be þi stronge champion þis daie

Wiþe outen gilt þou schalt be sleyne also swyþe
 Sche Sett hir doune on knes and þus sche seyde

 Haue ȝe nouht seen sum tyme a pale face
Amonge a pres of him þat haþe be lad
To wardes his deþ where him gat no grace
And suche a colour in his face haþ hadde

So stant Custance and lokeþ hire aboute
 O queens leueinge in prosperite

An Emperour douhter stant alone  
Sche haþe no whihte to whome to make hire mone
O blode Roial þat standest in þis drede

Þat from his yen ran þe water doune
Nowe hastely do feche a boke quod he
  
And if þis knyht wil swere howe þat sche
This womman slowhe ȝit wil we vs avise
Whome þat we wolde þat schal be oure Iustice
 A breton boke wreten wiþ þe euangelies

Sche giltif was in þe mene whiles
An hande him smote vpon þe nekke bone
Þat doune he fel att ones as a stone
And boþe his eyȝen borst oute of his face
In siht of euery body in þat place
 A voice was herde in general audience
And seide þou haste disclaundred giltles
The douhter of holy cherche in hiehe presence
Thus hast þou done and ȝit I mot hold my pes
Of þis Merueile agast was al þe pres
As Mased folke þei stoden euerychone
ffor drede of wreche saue Constance alone
 Grete was þe dede and eke þe repentance
Of hem þat hadden wronge suspecione
Vpon þis cely Innocent constance
And for þis miracle in conclusione
And by Constance Mediacione
The kinge and mony anoþer in þat place
Conuerted was þonked be cristes grace
 This fals knyht was sleyne for his vntrewþe
Be Iuggement of Allea Hastelye
And Constance haþe of his deþe grete rewþe
And after þis ihesus of his mercy
Maade Alla wedden ful solempnely

And þus haþe criste maad Constance a queene
  
 Bot who was woful If I schal not lye
Of þis wedynge bot Domylda and no mo

Sche wolde nouht her sonne had don so

So straunge a creature vnto his maake
 Me list nouht of þe chaf ne of þe stre
Maake so longe a tale as of þe corne
What scholde I tellen of þe royalte
Of þe Mariage or whiche cours goþ to forne
Who bloweþ in a trompe or in an horne
The fruyte of euery tale is for to seie
Thei ete and drinke and dance and singe and pleie
 Thei gone to bed as it was skill and riht
ffor þouhe þat wyues bene holy þinges
Thei must take a pacience a nyht
Suche maner necessaries as biene plesinges
To folke þat hane ywedded hem wiþ ringes
And laie a lite hire holines a side
As for þe time it maie non oþer betide
 On hire he gate a knaue childe anone
And to a bischop and his Cunstabule eke
He toke his wif to kepe whan he is gone
To scotelande ward his fomen for to seke
Nowe faire Custance þat is so humble and meke
So longe is gone wiþ childe til þat still
Sche halt hir chambure abideinge att cristes will
 The time is come a knaue childe sche bare
Mauricius att þe font þei him calle
This Constable doþ forþe come a Messagier
And wrote to his kinge þat cleped was Alle
  
Howe þat þis blisful tiþinge was befalle
And oþer tiþinge spedful for to seie
He takeþ þe letter and forþe he goþ his weie
 This Messagier to done his auantage
Vnto þe kinges moder rideþ swyþe
And salueþ hire ful faire in his langage
Madame quod he he ȝe maye glad and bliþe
And þonkeþ god an hundreþ þousand siþe
My lady queene haþ childe wiþ oute doute

 This Messagier dranke sadly ale and wyne
And stollne was his lettres priuely
Out off his box while he slepe as a swyne
And Conterfet was ful sotely
And oþer lettres wrouht ful sinfuly
Vnto þe kinge direct of þis matier
ffro his Constable as ȝe schal after here
 The lettre spak howe þe queene deliuerd was
Of so horrible fendelyche creature
That in þe Castel none so hardy was
That any while dorst þer in endure
The moder was an elfe be aventure
Ycome be charmes or be sorceri
And euery whitte hateþe hir company
  
 Woo was þis kinge whan he þis lettre had seyne
Bot to no white he tolde þis sorwe sore
Bot of his owen he wrote ageyne
Welcome be þe sonde of criste for euer more
To me þat am nowe lerend in his lore

 Kepeþ þis childe al be it foule or faire
And eke my wif vnto myne home comynge

More Agreable þan this to my likinge
This letter he seleþ priuely wepeinge
Whiche to þe Messagier was take sone
And forþe he goþe þare is nomore to done
 O Messagier fulfilde of dronkennesse
Stronge is þi breþe þi limmes faltern aye
And þou bewreyest al sekurnesse

Thi face is turned in a newe arraie
There drunkennesse reygneþ in any route
Þere is no counsel hidde wiþ outen doute
 O domilda I ne haue non englisshe digne

An þerfor to þe fende I þe resigne

And att þe kinges moder courte he liþe
And sche was of þis Messagier ful faine
And plesed him in al þat euer sche myht

And Charger þat sche neuer eft com þere

And whan þat he þis pitous lettre saye

Abundantly for hire ful longe space

And scheweþ þe kinge his seal and his letter

Thus endeþ olde Domylda wiþ meschaunce

And oþer lordes god wote manyone

Of hir estate þouhe sche schold deie

And wiþ þe Senatur sche led hir lif
Thus can owre lady bringen oute of wo

Bot to kinge Alla whiche I spake of ȝore
That for his wif wepeþ and sikeþ sore

Vnder þe Senatour gouernance
Kinge Alla whiche þat had his moder sleyne
Vppon a daie fel in suche repentance
Þat  if I schortly tellen schall and pleyne

And put him in þe popes ordinane  
In hihe and lowe and ihesu crist besouht

 The fame anone þorwhe Rome toune is borne
Howe alla kinge scha com in pilgrenage
Be herberioures þat went him be forne
ffor whiche þe Senatour as was þe vsage

 Grete chiere doþe þis noble Senatour
To kinge Alla and he to him also
Eueriche of hem doþ to oþere grete honour
And so befel þat on a daie or two
  
This Senatur is to kinge Alla go

 Som men wald seine att þe request of Custance

And to þe Senator he seide a none
Whos is þat faire childe þat stondeþ ȝonder

A moder he haþe bot fader haþe he none

There is no man couþe bringe hire to þat prik
 Nowe was þis childe as like vn to custance
As possible as is a creature to be
This Alla haþe þe face in remembrance
Of Dame Custance and þereon mused he
If þat þe childes moder weer ouht sche  
That is wif and priuely he siht
And sped him fro þe table þat he myht
  
 Par faye þouht he þe fantome is in myn hede

And afterward he maade his Argument
What wote I if þat crist hire haþ hider sent

To my contre from þens þat sche was went
 And after none home wiþ þe Senatour
Goþe Alla for to seen þis wonder chaunce

And for sorwe as dombe stant as a tre
So was hir hert schette in hire distresse
When sche remembred his vnkindenesse
 Twys sche swownede in his owen siht

So wisly of my soule as haue mercy
That of ȝoure harme as gelteles am I
As is Moris my sone so like ȝowre face

Or þat hir woful hertes myht cesse

Vnto hire fader no worde of hir seie
 Som men wold sey howe þat þe Childe morice

And whan sche seyhe hire fader in þe strete

Can muchel goode be goddes dignite

What eyley þe man so sinfuly to swere
Owr oste anseward Iankin be ȝe þere

This loller will prechen her sumwhat
Nay be my fader sowle þat sal he nat
Seid þe swyere her schal he nouht preche

He leueþ al in þe grete god he

Or sprengen cokel in oure clene corne
And þarfor oste I warne þe beforne
Mi Ioly body  schal a tale tell
And I schal klynken ȝow so mery a bell
Þat I schal waken al þis compaignie
Bot it schal not bien of philosophie
Ne fisleas ne turnies queynte of lawe
There is bot litel latine in my mawe
Att Sarray in þe londe o Tartary 
Ther dwelled a kinge þat werred Russy
þoruhe whiche þere deyed mony a douhti man 
þis nobil kinge was cleped Kambynskan
Whiche of his time whas of so grete renone
Thar þere nas nouhewere in no Regione
So excellent a lorde in al þinge
Him lakked nouh þat longed to a kenge
As of þe secte of whiche þat he was borne  
He kepped his laye to whiche þat he was sworne
And þerto he was harde wise and riche
And pytous and Iuste alwaie ylyche
Soþe of his worde benigne and honurable
Of his corage as any Centre stable
Ȝonge fressche and stronge in armes desirous
As any bachillier of al his house
A faire person he was and fortunate
And kepped alwaie so wele roiale astate
Þat þer nas nouhewhere suche a man

Had tuo sonnes on Eltheta his wif
Of whiche þe eldest hiht Algarsif

A douhte had þis worþi kinge also
Þat ȝongest was and hiht Canace
Bot for to tell ȝowe al hir beaute

Myn ynglisse eke is insufficient
It most bene a Rector excellent
That couþe vse colours longeinge for þat art
Ȝif he schold hire discryue any parte
I am none suche I most speke as I can
And so befel whan þat þis Cambynskan
Haþe tuenty wynter borne his Diademe
As he was wonte fro ȝere to ȝere 
He lete þe feste of his Natiuite

For he was nyhe his exaltacion

For whiche þe foules aȝein þe sone schene
What for þe seson and þe ȝonge grene

Aȝeine þe swerde of wynter kene and colde
This Kambynskan of whiche I haue ȝow tolde
In Roial vestment sitte on his dese  
Wiþ Dyademe ful hihe in his paleyce
And halt his feste solempne and so riche
Þat in þis werld ne was þer none it lyche
Of whiche if I schal tel al þe arraye
Þan wolde it Occupie a somers daie
And eke it nedeþ nouht to deuise
Of euery cours þe order of hir seruise
I wil nouht tel of hir strange sewese
Ne of hir swannes ne of hire heronsewese
Eke in þat londe as tellen knygtes olde
Þer is sum mete þat is ful deynte holde

Þere is no man þat maie reporten al
  
I wil nouht tarien ȝow for it is prime
For it is no fruyte bot losse of time
In to my ferst purpos I wil haue my recours
And so befel þat after þe þred cours
While þat þis kinge sitte þus in his nobley
Herkenynge his mynstralles here þinges pley
Beforne him att þe borde deliciously
In at þe hall dore al sodeynly

And in his honde a brode meroure of glas
Vpon his þome he had of golde a renge
And be his side a naked swerde hanginge
And vpe he rideþ to þe hihe borde
In all þe hall ne was þere spoke a worde
For merveile of þis knyht him to beholde
Full besily þei wayten ȝonge and olde
This strange knyht þat cam þus sodanly
Al armed saue his hed ful richelye
Salued þe kinge þe qwene and þe lordes all
Be order as þei seten in þe hall
Wiþ so hihe reuence and obeissance

Þat Gawen wiþ his olde Curtasie
Thouhe he come aȝeine oute of fayre
Ne couþe him nouht amende wiþ no worde
And after þis befor þe hihe borde
He wiþ a manly voice seide his mesage
After þe forme vsed in his langage
Withoute vice of sillable or letter  
And for his tale scholde seme þe better
Accordant to his wordes was his chiere
As techeþ arte of speche hem þat it lere
Albeit þat I ne can soune his stele
Ne can nouht cleme ouere so hihe a stele
Ȝit seie I þis as to comen entente
Þus muche amonteþ al þat euere he mente
  
If it so be þat I haue it in my mynde
He saide þe kinge of arabie and of ynde
My liege lorde on þis solempne daye
Salueþ ȝowe as he best can and maie
Ande sendeþ ȝowe in honour of ȝowre feste
Be me þat am redie al att ȝoure heste
This stede of bras þat Esily and wele

This is to saie in xxiiij houres
Where so ȝowh lust in drouht or in schoures
Beren ȝoure body in to euery place
To whiche ȝoure herte wilneþ for to pace
Wiþoute wem of ȝowe þoruh foule or faire
Or if ȝowe liste to flie as hihe in þe Eyre
As doþ an Ele whan him list to sore
Þis same stede schal bere ȝowe euer more
Wiþoute harme til ȝe be þere ȝow list
Thow þat ȝe slepen vpon his bak or rist
And torne aȝeine wiþ writhinge of a pinne
He þat it wrouht couþe ful mony a gynne
He waited mony constillacion
Or he had do þis operacion
And knewe ful mony a seale and mony a bonde
This Miroure eke þat I haue in myne honde
Haþ suche a myhe þat men maie in hit se
Whan þere schal fal any aduersite
Vnto ȝoure Regne or to ȝoure self also
And openly who is ȝoure frende or foo
And oue al þis if any lady briht
Haþe sette hire hert on any maner whiht
If he be false  schal his treson see
His newe loue and al his subtilite
So oppenly þat þere schal no þinge hide
Wherefor aȝein þis lusti somer tide
This mirrour and þis ringe þat ȝe maie see  
He haþe sent to my ladie Canacee
  
Ȝowre excellent douhter þat is here
The vertue of þis ringe if ȝe wil here
Is þis þat if hire list it for to were
Vpon hir þome or in hir purse it bere
There is no foule þat flieþ vnder heuen
Þat sche ne shal vnderstonde his steuen
And knowe his meneynge openly and pleyne
And answere him in his langage aȝeine
And euery grasse þat groweþ vpon rote
Se schal wel knowe and whom it wil do bote
Al be his wondes neuer so depe and wide
 This naked swerde þat hingeþ be my side
Suche vertue haþ þat what man so it smyte
þoruhe oute his armour it wil kerue and bite
Were it as þikke as is a braunched oke
And what man þat is wonded wiþ þe stroke
Schal neuere be hole til þat ȝou list of grace
To stroke him wiþ þe plat in þilke place
There he is hurte þis is as muche to seine
Ȝe most wiþ þe platte swerde aȝeine
stroke him in þe wounde and it wil close
This is a verrei soþe wiþouten glose
It faileþ nouht whiles it is in ȝoure holde
 And whan þis knyht haþe þus his tale tolde
He rideþe oute of þe hall and doune he liht
His stede which þat schone as sonne briht
Stant in þe courte stille as any stone
Þis knyht is to his chambre lad anone
And is armede and is to þe mete yset
The presentes bien ful richely yfett
This is to seine þe swerde and þe mirrour
And borne anone vnto þe hihe toure
Wiþ certeine oficeres yordeyned þere fore
And vnto Canacee þe ringe is bore
Solemply þer sche sit att þe table
Bot sekurly wyþouten any fable
  
The hors of bras þat maye nouȝt be remewed
It stant as it were to þe grounde yglewed
Þer maie no man oute of þe place it driue
For none engyne of windas or poliue
And cause whi for þei can nouȝt þe craft  
And þerfor in þe place þei haue it laft
Til þat þe knith haþe tauht hem þe manere
To voyden him as ȝe schal after here
Grete was þe pres þat swarmed to and fro
To gauren on þis hors þat stondeþ so
For it so hihe was and brode and longe
So wele proporcioned for to be stronge
Riht as it were a stede of lumbardie
Therwiþ so horslye and so quik of eye
As it a gentil poileys courser were
For certes fro his taile vnto his ere
Nature ne art kouþe him nouht mende
In no degre as al þe peple wende
Bot euermore here most wonder it was
How þat it couþe gone and was of bras
It was of faire as þe peple semed
Diuerse folke diuersely haue demed
As mony hedes as mony wittes þere bene
þei mormorede as done a swarme of bene
And maden skilles after hire fantasies
Rehersinge of þe olde poetries
And seide it was like to þe pegasee
Þe hors þat hade wenges for to flee
Or elles it was þe grekes hors Sinon
Þat brouht troye to destructione
As men þis olde gestes rede
Myne herte quod one is euermore in drede
I trowe som men of armes bene þar inne
That schapen hem þis Cite for to wynne
It were riht good þinge þat al suche wer knowe
Anoþere rowned to his felowe lowe
  
And seide he lyed for it is raþer like
An apparence made be some magik
As Iogelours pleyne att þes festes grete
Of sundry þinges þus þei Iangle and trete
As lewed peple demeþ comunlye
Of þinges þat bene more maad soubtillye
Þan þei can in her lewdenes comprehende
Þei demen gladdely to þe badder ende
And some of hem wondren on þe myrroure
þat borne was vpe vnto þe maister toure
Howe men miht in it suche þinges see  
Anoþer ansewarde and seide it miht wele bee
Naturaly be composicions
Of Angeles and of slyhe reflexions
And seide þat in Rome was suche one
Þei speke of alocen and vitilione
Of Aristotle þat write in hir liues
Of wheynte merorous and of wheynte perspectiues
As knowen þei þat hane hire bokes herde
 And oþer folke hane wondred on þe swerde
Þat wolde perce þoruhe euery þinge
And fel in speche of Theople þe kinge
And of Achilles for his queinte spere
For he couþe wiþ it boþe hele and dere
Riht in suche wise as men mai wiþ þe swerde
Of whiche riht nowe ȝe hauen ȝoure seluen herde
Þei speken of sundri hardinge of Metal
And speke of Medecines þer wiþ al
And howe and whan it schold harded be
Whiche is knowe algat vnto me
Tho speke þei of Canace ringe
And seyden al þat suche a wonder þinge
Of craft of ringes herde þei neuer none
Saue þat he Moyses and kinge Salomone
Had a name of kunynge of suche arte
Thus seine þe peple and drawen hem aparte
  
Bot naþeles sum seide þat it was
Wondre to maken of feren assche glas
And ȝit is nouȝt glas not like Aschen of ferene
Bot for þei han knowen it so ferne
Therfor ceseþ hir Iangelinge and hir wonder
As sore wonder sum of cause of þonder
On hepe on flode on gossomere and on myst
And al þinge til he þe causes wist
Þus Iangele þei and demen and deuise
Til þat þe kinge gan fro his borde arise
Phebus haþ laft þe angel Meredyonal
And ȝit ascendinge was þe best Royal
The gentil Lion wiþ his Aldrian
Whan þat þis Tatre kinge Kambiuskan
Ros fro his borde þer as he satt ful hihe
Beforne him goþe þe lowde Minstralcye
Till he came vnto his chambre of paramentes  
Ther as þei sownen diuers Intrumentes
Þat is like an heuen for to here
Nowe dauncen lusti venus childern dere
For in þe fissche her lady satt ful hihe
And lokeþ on hem wiþ a frendely eye
This noble kinge is sette vppon his trone
This strange knyht is fette to him ful sone
And on þe daunce he goþe wiþ Canacee
Here is þe reuel and þe Iolyte
þat is not able a dol man to deuise
He most han knowe loue and his seruise
And bene a festely man as fressche as maye
þat scholde ȝowe devisen suche arraye
Who couþe tellen ȝowe þe forme of þe daunces
So vnkouþe and suche frisshe contenance
Suche lokeinges subtile and dissimilignes
For drede of Ielowsy mennes perceyueinges
No man bot Launcelet and he is dede
Therefor I pas ouer of al þis lustihede
  
I saie no more Bot in þis Iolines
I lete hem to men to soper hem dres
The stewarde biddeþ spices for to hihe
And eke þe wine in al þis Melodye

The spices and þe wine be come anone
Thei ete and dronke and whan þis had an ende
In to þe temple as reson was þei wende
The seruice done þei sowpen al be daye
What nedeþ ȝow rehersen hire arraye
Iche man wote wele þat att þe kinges fest
Haþ plente to þe maste and to þe lest
And deinteþes mo þan be in my knowynge
And affter soper goþ þis noble kinge
To seen þis hors of bras wyþ al a route
Of lordes and of ladis him aboute
Suche was þere on þis hors of bras
þat seþen þe grete sege of troy was
Thar as men wonderden on an hors also
Ne was þere suche a wondrynge as was þo
Bot finaly þe kinge axeþ þis knyht

And praied him to tel his gouernance  
The hors anone began to trippe and daunce
Whan þat þe knyht laide honde vpon þe ryne
And seide sir þer is no mor to seine
Bot whan þe luste to ride any where
Ȝe most trill a pinne þat stant in his ere
Whiche I schal tel ȝow betwene vs tuo
Ȝe mot neuen him to what place also
Or to what cuntre þat ȝoue lust to ride
And whan ȝe come þere as ȝe lust to abide
Bid him descende and tril anoþere pinne
For þerein liþe þe effect of al þe ginne
And wil doune descende and done ȝowre will
And in þat place he wil abide still
  
If al þe werld had þe contrarie swore
He schal not þens be þrowe ne bore
Or if þu luste bidde him þens gone
Tril þis pinne and he wil vanessche anone
Owte of þe siht of euery maner whiht
And come aȝeine be it daie or nyht
Whan þat ȝowe lust to klepen him aȝeine
In suche a gise as I schal to ȝowe seine
Betwexen ȝowe and me and þat ful sone
Ride whan ȝow luste þer is no more to done
Enformed whan þe kinge was of þe knyht
And haþe conseyued in his witte a riht
The manere and þe forme of all þis þinge
Ful glad and bliþe þe noble douhti kinge
Repeiringe to his reuel as beforne
The bridel is in to þe toure yborne
And kepped amonge his Iewels leue and dere
The hors vanissed I not in what manere
Owte of her siht ȝe gette no mor of me
Bot þus I lete in lust and Iolite
þis kambynscan his lordes festinge
Til wele nyhe þe daie began to springe
The norice of digestion is slepe
Gan on hem winke and bad hem take kepe
That muche mete and labur wold haue rest
And wiþ a galpinge mouþe he al hem kest
And seide þat it was time to lye adowne
For blode was in his dominacione  
Chiriseþ blode naturs frende quod he
Thei þonken him galpinge be two be þre
An euery whiht gan drawene him to his rest
As slepe hem bad þei toke it for þe best
  
Hir dremes schal nouht be told for me
Ful was here heuedes of fumosite
That causeþ dreme of wiche þer is no charge
Thei slepen til it was prime large
The most parte bot it were Canace
Sche was ful mesurable as wemmen be
For of hir fader had sche take hir leue
To go to rest sone after it was eue
Hir lust nouȝt apalled for to bue
For on þe morwe vnfestlyche for to se
And sleped hir furst slepe and wooke
For suche a ioye sche in hire hert toke
Boþe of hir wheynte ringe and of hir meroure
Þat twenty times sche chaunged hir coloure
And in hir slepe riht for impressione
Of hir meroure sche hadde a visione
Where for or þat þe sonne vp gan glide
Sche cleped vpon hire Maistres hire beside
And seide þat hir luste for to rise
Thes olde wemme þat bene gladly wise
As is her Maistres answard hire anone
And seide Madame wheder wil ȝe gone
Thus erely folke been al in rest
I wil quod sche arise for me lest
No longer slepe bot to walken aboute
Hire Maistres clepeþe wimmen a grete route
And vp þei resen wele ten or twelue
Vp riseþ ffrische Canacee hire selue
As Rody and briht as þeyhe þe ȝonge sonne

Noon hier was he whan sche redy was
And forþ sche walkeþ esili apase
Arraid afte þe lusti seson suote
Lyhtly for to pleye and walk on fote
Not bot v or vj of hir Meinȝe
For in a trenche fere in þe parke goþ sche
  
The vapor whiche þat fro þe erþe glode
Makeþ þe sonne to seme rody and brode
Bot naþeles it was so faire a siht  
Þat it maad all hir hertes for to liht
What for þe seson and þe morneynge
And for þe foules þat sche herde singe
For riht anone sche wist what þei mente
Riht be hir songe and knowe al her entente
The knotte whi þat euery tale is tolde
If it be taried til lust be colde
Of hem þat han it herkened after ȝore
The sauoure passeþe euer þe langere more
For fulsomnesse of prolixite
And be þis same reson þenkeþ me
I schol vnto þe knotte condescende
And make of hire walkinge sone an ende
Amydde a tree fordrie as white as chalke
As Canacee was pleyinge in hir walke
Ther sat a fawcon ouer hir heued ful hihe
That wiþ a pitous voice so gan to crie
That al þe woode resed of hire Crie

wiþ boþe hire wenges til þe rede blode
Ran endlonge þe tre þer as sche stode
And euer in one sche cried alweie and schryht
And wiþ hir beke hire seluen so sche piht

For sorwe sche shreyht for hir alweie so lowþe
For þar nas neuer ȝit man on liue

Of schap of þat þat myht rekened be
A faukon peregryne þan semed sche
  
Of fremed londe and euermore as sche stode
Sche swowned now and now for lak of blode
Til wel nyhe is sche fallen fro þe tree
This faire kinges douhter þis Canace

Thorwe whiche sche vnderstod wele euery þinge

And kowde ansewere him in his leden aȝeine
Haþe vnderstonde þat þis faukon seide
And wel nyhe for reuþe almoste sche deide
And to þe tre sche goþe ful hastely  
And on þis faukon loked ful pitously 
And held hir lap abrode for wele sche wist
The fawkon most fal fro þe twyst
Whan þat it swoned next for lak of blode
A longe while to waite hire sche stode
Til att þe last sche spak in þis manere
Vnto þe hauke as ȝe schal after here
 What it þe cause if it be to tell
That ȝe bue in þis furial peine of hell
Quod Canacee vnto þis hauke aboue
Is þis for sorwe of deþe or losse of loue
For as  trowe þes bene causes two
Þat Causen moste a gentil hert woo
Of oþer harme it redeþ not to speke
For þi ȝoureselfe vpon ȝoure self ȝowe wreke
Whiche þat proueþ wele þat eyþer ire or drede
Mot bene encheson of ȝoure crewel dede
Sen þat I see none oþer whiht ȝoue chace
For loue of god so do ȝowre self grace
Or what maye be ȝoure helpe for west nor este
Ne sawhe I neuere ar nowe no brid no beste
That ferd wiþ him self so pitously
Ȝe slee me wiþ ȝoure sorwe verrayly
I haue of ȝowe so grete compassione
For goddes loue com fro þe tre adowne
  
And as I am a kinges douhter trewe
If þat I verrayly þe cause knewe
Of yowre disease if laie in my myht
I wold amend it or þat it wer nyht
As wissely helpe me grete god of kinde
And herbes schal I riht ynowe finde
To hele wiþþe ȝowre hurtes hastely
Tho schright þis faukon more pitously
Than euer sche dede and fel to grounde anone
And lieþ on swowne dede as any stone
This Canace haþe in hir lappe hir take
Vnto þat time sche gan of swoune awake
And after þat sche of swowne gan abraide
Riht in hir haukes loden þus sche seid
That pite renneþ sone in gentil hert
Feleynge is similitude in peines smert
Is proued al daie as men maie it see  
As wele be werke as be auctorite
For gentil hert kepeþ gentillesse
I see wele þat ȝe hane of me destresse
Compassione my faire Canacee
Of verrey wommanly benyngnite
Þat nature in ȝoure principles haþe sett
Bot for no hope for to fare þe bett
Bot for to obeie vnto ȝoure hert fre
And for to maken oþere be war be me
As be þe whelpe chastized es þe lyon
Riht for þat cause and for þat conclusion
While þat I haue a leiser and a space
Myne harme I wil confessen ar I pace
And euer while þat one hire sorwe tolde
þe toþer weped as sche to water wolde
Til þat þe faukon bad hir to be still
And wiþ a sike þus sche seide hir till
There I was bred alas þat ilke daie
And fosterd in a roche of Marble graie
  
So tenderly þat no þinge eyled me
I wist nouht what was aduersite
Til I kouþe flie ful hihe vnder þe skye
Tho dwelled a tarselet me fast bye
Þat semed wele of al gentillesse
Al were he ful of treson and of falsenesse
It is wrapped vnder humble charite
And vnder hiewe of trowþe and in suche manere
Vnde plesance and vnder besi peine
Þat no wyht couþ haue wende he couþ feyne
So depe in greine he deiede his coloures
Riht as a serpent hideþ him vnder floures
til he may se his time for to bite
Riht so þis god of loue Ipocrite
Doþe so his cerimonijs and obeiceances
And keped in semblant al his obseruances
And souneþ in to gentilles of loue
As in to a tombe is al þe faire aboue
And vnder is þe cours suche as I wote
Swyche was þis ypocrit boþe colde and hoote
And in þis wise he serued his entent
þat saue þe fende no man wist what he mente
Til he so longe had wepen ad compleyned  
And mony a ȝere his seruice to me feyned
Til þat myne herte to pytous and to nyce
Al Innoce of his crowel malice
Forfered of his deþ as þouht me
Vpon his oþes and his surete
Graunted him loue vpon þis condicione
þat euer mo myn honoure and renoune
Were saued boþ priue and aperte
This is to seine þat after his desert
I ȝaf him al myn herte and al myn þouht
God woote and he and oþer wise nouht
And toke his hert in chaunge of myne for aye
Bot soþe is seide gon siþen mony a daye
  
A trew wihte and a þefe þenkeþ nat one
And whan he sawe þe þinge so fer ygone
That I graunted him fully my loue
In suche a gise as I haue seide aboue
And ȝeuen him my trewe herte as fre
As he swore he ȝaue his hert to me
Anone þis Tigre ful of doublenesse
Fele on his knees wiþ so deuoute humblesse
With hihe reuerence and as be his chier
So like a gentil louere of manere
So rauesshed as it semed for þe Ioye
þat neuer Iason ne Paris of troye
Iason certes ne none oþere man
Syn lameþ was þat alþer first began
To louen two as writen folke byforne
Ne neuer siþe þe first manne was borne
Ne couþe man be tuenty þousand parte
Counterfete þe sophimes of his arte
Ne war worþi to vnbokle his galoche
Ther dowblenesse or feyneinge schold aproche
Ne so kouþe þonke a whight as he did me
His maner was an heuen for to see
Til any womman were sche neuer so wise
So peynted he and kembeþ att pinte deuise
Als wele is worde as his countenance
And I so loued him for his Obeissance
And for þe treuþe I demed in his herte
That if so were þat any þinge him smerte
Al ware it neuer so litel and I it wiste

In al þinge as fer as reson fill
Kepeinge þe boundes of my worschip euere

As him god woote ne neuer schal no mo

That I supposed of him no þinge bot goode
Bot finaly þus att þe laste it stode
That fortune wolde þat he most twynne
Owte of þat place whiche þat I was inne
Where me was woo it is no questione

For o þinge dar I tell boldely

Suche harme I felte for he ne myht beleue
So on a daye of me he toke is leue
So sorwfully eke þat I wende verrayly
That he had feled as muche harme as I
Whan þat I herd him speke and sawe his hiewe
Bot naþeles I þouht he was so trewe
And eke þat he repaire scholde agayne
Wiþ inne a lite while soþe to seine
And reson wolde eke þat he mot go
For his honour as oft happeþ so

And toke it wele seþþe þat it most be
As I best myht I hidde fro him my sorwe
And toke him by þe honde seint Iohn to borwe
And seid þus lo I am ȝoures al
Beþe suche as I haue bue to ȝowe and schal
What he answarde it nedeþ nouht reherse
Who can sei bet þan he whou kan do werse
Whan he haþ al wele seide þan haþ he done
Therfor behoueþ him a ful longe spone

So att þe last he mote forþe his weye
And forþe he flyeþ til he cam where him liste
Whan it com him to purpos for to riste
I trowe he hadde þilke text in mynde  
Þat al þinge repaireinge to his kinde
  
Gladeþ him selfe þus seine men as I gesse
Men loue of propre kinde newefangelnesse
As birdes done þat men in cage fede
For þouhe þe nyht and daie take of hem hede
And strewe hir cage faire and soft as silke
And ȝiue hem suger hony brede and melke
Ȝit riht anone as þat his dore is huppe
He wiþþe wiþ his fete wi sporne doune his cuppe
And to þe wode he wil and wermes ete
So new fongel be þei of her mete
And louen none leueres of propre kinde
Ne gentilles of maie hem binde
So ferde þis tarselet alas þis daie
þouhe he ware gentil borne frische and gaie
And goodly for to see and humble and free
He sawe vpon a time a kite fle
And sodanly he loued þis kite soo

And haþ his trouþe falsed in þis wise

And I am lorne wiþoute remedie
And wiþ þat worde þis fawkon gan to crie
And swowned eft in Canace barme

And softely in plastres gan hir wrappe

Of herbes precious and fyne of hewe
To helen wiþ þe hauke fro daie to nyht

And be hir beddes hede sche maade a mewe
And couerd it wiþ veluetes blewe

Therefore oste takeþ nowe goode heede

For lordeinges sen I twelue ȝere was of Age

Þat gentil tixt can I wele vnderstonde
Eke wele I he seide myn husbonde
Scholde lete fader and moder and tak to me

Of bygamy or of octagamye
Whi scholde y þan of it haue velanye
Loke here þe wisman kinge Salomon
I trowe he had wyues mo þan one
Now wolde god it leuefull were to me
To be refresched half so oft as he
Whiche ȝift of god had he for al his wyves
No man haþe suche þat in þis werld on lyue is
God wote þis noble kinge as to my witt
Þe first nyht he hadde mony a mery fitt
Wiþ iche of hem so wele was him on live
Blissed be god þat I haue wedded fyue
Welcome be þe sext whan þat euer he schall
For soþe I wil nouȝt kepe chaste in all
Whan myn husbonde is from þe werlde gone
Son cresten man schal wedde me anone
For þan þe Apostle seiþe þat I am fre
To wedde on goddes halue where it likeþ me
He seiþe to be wedede is no sinne
Better is to be wedded þan to berne  
What rekkeþe me þouhe folke seie velanye
Of schrewed lameþ and his Bigamye
I wote wele Abraham was an holy man
And Iacob eke as fer as euere y kan
And eche of hem had wyves mo þan tuo
And mony anoþer holy man also
Wher can ȝe seye in any maner age
Þat vs god defended Mariage
  
Be expresse worde I praie ȝowe telleþ me
Or where commaunded he virginite
I wote as wele as ȝe it is no drede
The Apostle whan he spekeþe of Maidenhede
He seide þereof precept had I none
Men mai consel a womman to bene one
Bott counseillinge is no comandement
He put it in owre owen Iugement
For had god commanded maidenhede
þan hadde he dampned wedinge wiþ þe dede
And certes if þere were no sede Isowe

Poule dorst nouht commanden att þe leste
A þinge of whiche his maistre ȝaf him none heste
The darte is sett vp for virginitee
Chase who so maye  who so renneþ best let see
Bot þis worde is nouht take of euery whiht
Bot þere as god wolde gif it of his myht
I wote wele þat þe Apostle was a maide
Bot Naþeles þouhe þat he wrote or saide
He wolde þat euery wight were suche as he
All ne is bot counseill to virginite
And for to be a wif he ȝaue me leue
Of Indulgence so is it of no repreue
To wedde me if þat my  make dye
Wiþoute excepcione of bigamye
Al were it goode no womman for to touche
He ment as in his body or his couche
For perill is boþe to touche and for to assemble
Ȝe knowe what þis ensample maie resemble
Þis all and somme he helde virginite
Mor perfite þan wedded in frelete
Freelte clepe I nouht bot þat he and sche  
Wolde lede here life al in chastite
I graunte it wele I haue none envye
þouhe maidenhed prefer bygamye
  
It likeþ hem to be clene in body and goste
Of myne astate I wil make no boste
For wele ȝe knowe a lorde in his housholde
Haþe nouht euery vessel of golde
Some biene of tree and done lorde seruise
God clepeþ folke to him in sunder wise
And eueryche haþ of god a proper ȝift
Som þis som þat as him likeþ to schift
Virginite is grete perfectione
And conscience eke wiþ deuocione
Bot crist þat of perfection is well
Bad nouht euery whight he schold sell
All þat he hadde and ȝiue it to þe pore
And in suche wise folowe him and his lore

And lordeynges be ȝoure leue þat am nouȝt I

And of so perfit wise and why ywrouht

Of vryne and owre boþe þinges smale

And for none oþere cause what seie ȝe noo

So þat þe clerkes be not wiþ me wroþe

Of engenderinge þere we nouht god displese
Whi scholden men elles in hire bokes sette
þat man schal ȝelde to his wife his dette
Nowe wherewiþ scholde he paye his payment
If þat he ne vsed his sely instrument
  
Than were þei maade vpon a creature

Bot I sei nouȝt þat euery wyht is holde

Myne husbond schal it haue boþe eue and morwe
Whan þat him luste com forþe and paie his dette
An husbond I wil haue I wil not lette
Whiche schal be boþe my dettour and my þrall
And haue his tribulacione wiþ all

 And þerfor euery man þis tale I telle

My ferþe husbonde was a reueloure

And I was ȝonge and ful of ragerie
Stiborne and stronge and Ioly as a pye

And singe Iwis as any nyhtengale
Whan I hadde dronke a drawht of swete wyne

That wiþ a staf beraft his wif here lyf
For sche dranke wyne þouhe I had bue his wif
Ne scholde he nouht haue daunted me fro drinke
And after wyne of venus must I þinke
For also seker as colde engendereþ haile
A likerous mouþe most haue a likerous taile

Vnto þis daie it doþ myne hert bote
That I haue had my werlde as my time
Bot age alas þat all wil envenyme
Haþe me beraft my beaute and my piþþe
Lat go fare wele þe deuel go þere wiþþe
The floure is gone þere is no more to telle
Þe bran as I best can nowe mot I selle
Bot ȝit to be riht merye wolde I fonde
Now forþe to tell of my ferþe husbonde
I sei I had in herte grete dispite
þat he of any oþer had delite
Bot he was qwytte be god and be seinte Iose
I maade him of þe same wode a crose
Not of my body in no foule manere
Bot certeynly I maade folke suche chiere
þat in his owen gres I maade him frie
For angers and for verraie Ielousye
Be god in erþe I was his purgatorye
For whiche I hope his soule be in glorie
For god it wote he satte ful ofte and songe
Whan þat his scho ful bitterly him wronge
  
For þere was none saue gode and he þat wiste
In mony wise where I him twiste
He dyed whan I cam from Ierusaleme
And lyeþ in a graue vnder þe rode beme
Al nys is toumbe not so curious
As was þe sepulcre of him Darius
Whiche þat Appelles wrouhten soubtely
It nys bot wast to beri him preciouslye
Lat him fare wele god ȝeue his sowle rest
He is nowe in his graue and in his chest
Nowe of my fift husbond wil I tell
God lat neuer his soule come in hell
And ȝete was he to me þe most schrewe
þat fele I on my ribbes al be rewe
And euer schal vnto myne endeynge daie
Bot in owre bedde he was so fressche and gaie
And þerwiþ also wele couþe he me glose
Whan þat he wolde haue my bele chose
þat þouhe he hadde me bette on euery bone
He couþe winne aȝeine my loue anone
I trow I louede him bette for he  
Was of his loue daungerous to me
We wemmen haue if þat I schal nouht lye
In þis manere a qweynte fantasye
Whayte what þinke we may nouht lyhtly haue
Þereafter wil we crie al daie and craue
Forbede us þinge and þat desiren we
Pres on vs fast and þan wil we fle
Wiþe daungier owten we al oure chafre
Gret pres att þe Market makeþ dere ware
And to grete chepe is holde att littel pris
þis knoweþ euery womman þat is wys
My venus husbonde god his soule blisse
Whiche þat I toke for loue and for no richisse
He sumtyme was a clerke of Oxenforde
And had left scole and went att home to borde
  
Wiþþe my gossibbe dwelinge in oure toune
God haue hire soule hire name was Alison
Sche knewe myne hert and al my priuete
better þan oure parische preste so mot I þe
To hire bewryed I my counsell all
For hadde my husbond pissed on a wall
Or done a þinge þat schold haue cost his lif
To hir and to anoþer worþi wif
And to my nece whiche I loue wele
I wolde haue tolde his counsel euery dele
And so I dide ful often god it wote
þat maade his face often rede and hote
For verray schame and blamed himselfe for he
Had tolde to me so grete a priuete
And so it befell þat ones in a lente
So oft time I to my gossip wente
For euer ȝit I loued to be gay
And for walke in marche aprile and Maie
Fro hous to hous to herken sondaye tales
Þat Iankin clerke and my gossib dam Alice
And I my selfe into þe felde wente
Myne husbond was att Londen al þat lente
I hadde þe better leyser for to pleie
And for to see and eke for to be seie
Of lusty folke what wist I where my grace
Was schapen for to be or in what place
Therefor maade I my visitacions  
To vigiles and to processions
To precheinge eke and to þis pilgrimages
To pleis of Miracles and of Mariages
And wered vpon my gaie scarlet Gytes
This wermes ne þes mouhtes ne þis mytes
Vpon my perel fete hem neuer a dele
And wost þou whie for þei were vsed wele
Nowe wil I telle forþe what happed me
I saie þat in þe felde walked wee
  
Til trewely we had suche daliance
þis clerke and I þat of my purueance
I spak to him and seide how þat he
If I were wedowe scholde wedde me
For certeinly I saie for no bobance
þat was I neuer ȝit wiþoute purueance
Of mariage ne of oþer þinges eke
I holde a mannes witte nouht worþe a leke
þat haþ bott one hole to sterte vnto
And if þat faile þan is þat al ydo

My dame taught me that subtilte
And I seide I mette of hym all nyght
He wolde haue shamed me as I ley vpright
And my bedde was verey blode
But yite I hope that ye shull do me good
ffor good blode betokenyth Golde as I was taught
And all was fals I dremed of hym right noght
But as I folowed my Dames lore
  
Bot nowe sire lete me se what I schal seyne
A ha be god I haue my tale aȝeine
Whan þat myn faire husbonde laie on bere
I wepe al gate and maad sory chiere
As wives moten for it is vsage
And wiþ my kerchef kouerde my vesage
Bot for þat I was purveide of a make
I wepe bot smale and þat I vnder take
To cherche was my husbonde borne on morwe
Wiþ neyhbors þat for him maad sorwe
And Iankin oure clerke was on of þo
As helpe me god whan þat I sihe him go
Affeter þe bere me þouht he hadd a peire
Of leges of feet so clene and faire
þat al my herte I ȝaf vnto his holde
He was I trowe tuewty winter olde
  
And I was fourty if þat I schal seie soþe
Bot ȝit I had alwaie a coltes toþe
Gate toþede I was and þat become me wele
I had þe printe of seint venus seale
As helpe me god I was a lusti one
And faire and riche and ȝonge and wele begone
And treuly as myne husbonde tolde me  
I hadde þe best quoniam þat myht be

In felyng and myn herte all marcian
Venus me yaf my lust my likyng and licorousnes
And Mars gaf me my sturdi hardynes  
Myne asscendent was taurus and mars þere inne
Alas alas þat euer loue was sinne
I folowed ay myne Inclinacion
Be vertue of mye constillacion
þat maade me I couþe nouȝt wiþdrawe
Mi chambre of venus frome a goode felawe

And also in another pryue place
ffor god so wisse be my saluacion
I louyd neuyr bi non discrescion
But euyr folewid myn appetite
All were he schort long blak or white
I toke no kepe so that he liked me
How pore he was ne eke of what degre
What scold I seie bot at þe moneþes ende
This Ioly clerk Iankin þat was so hende
Haþe wedde me wiþ grete solempnite
And to him ȝaf I al þe londe and fee
þat euere was me ȝeuene þare before
Bot afterwarde repentede me ful sore
He wolde suffer no þing of my lust
Be god he smote me ones on þe luste
for þat I rent oute of his booke a lef
þat of þat stroke myne eren wexen def
  
Styborne I was as is a lyonesse
And of my tonge a verreie Iangeleres
And walke I walde as I had do beforne
Frome house to house al þouhe he had it sworne
For wiþ often time he wolde preche
And me olde romans gestes teche
Howe he simplicius gallus left his wif
And hire forsoke for terme of his lif
Not bot for hopen hede he hire seie
Lokeynge oute att his dore on a daie
Anoþer Romeyne tolde he me be name
That for his wif was att a somer game
Wiþowte his weteinge he forsooke here eke
And þan wolde he vpon his bible seeke
þat ilke prouerbe of ecclesiast
Where he commandeþ and forbedeþ fast
Man schal not suffur his wif go roile aboute
Than wolde he saie riht þus wiþouten doute
 Who so þat bildeþ his house al of salowes
And prikeþ his blinde hors ouere þ falowes
And sufferþ his wif for seken halowes
Is worþi to be honge on þe galowes
Bot al for not I set not an hawe
Of his prouerbes ne of his olde lawe
Ne I wolde nouht of him correct be  
I hate him þat my vice telleþ me
And so do mo god wote of vs þan I
þis maade him wiþe me woode al vtterly
I nolde nouht forbere him in no caas
Nowe wil I seye ȝowe soþe be seint thomas
Whi þat I rent oute of his boke a lefe
For whiche he smote me þat I was defe
He had a booke þat gladly nyht and daie
For his disporte he wolde rede al weie
He clepede valerye and theofraste
Att whiche boke he lauhe alweye ful fast
  
Ande eke þare was sum time a clerke in rome
A Cardinale þat hiht seint Ierome
þat maad a boke aȝeine Iouynyane
In whiche booke eke þer was torculane
Crisippus Trecula and helowys
That was Abbas nouȝt fer fro parische
And eke þe paraboles of Salomon
Ovydes arte and bokes many one
And al þis were boundene in o velome
And euery nyht and day was his custome
Whan he had leysere and vacacione
frome oþer werldly occupacione
To reden on þis boke of wikked wyues
He knewe of hem mo legentez and liues
Than bue of goode wyues in þe bible
For trusteþ wele it is an impossible
þat any clerke wil speken good of wyves
Bot if it bue of holy seintes lyues
Ne of none oþer womman neuere þe mo
Who peynted þe lyon tel me who
Be god if wemmen had wreten stories
As clerkes haue wiþinne hire oratories
Thei wold haue wreten of men more wikkednesse
þan al þe mark of Adam maie redresse
The childern of Mercure and Venus
Bene in hire wirkeinge contrarius
Mercurie loue wisdome and sciens
And venus loueþ riote and dispens
And for hir diuers disposicion
Sche falleþ in oþer exaltacion
And þus godde wote Mercurie is desolate  
In piscis where venus is exaltate
And venus falleþ þere Mercurie is reised
Þerefor no womman of no man is preised
Þe clerke whan he is olde and maie nouht do
Of venus werkes worþe his olde scho
  
Than sitte he doune and write in his dotage
That wemmen kan nouht kepe here Mariage
Bot nowe to purpos why I tolde þe
Þat I was beten for a booke perde
Vpon a nyht Iankin þat was owre sire
Radd on his boke as he satte be þe fire
Of Eue first þat for hire wykkednesse
Was al man kinde first brouht to wrechednesse

that bought vs with his herte blood ageyne
lo here expresse of recorde  may ye fynde
that woman was the loos  of al mankynde  
þo redde he me howe sampson lost his heris
Slepeinge his lemman kut it wiþþe hire scheris
Thorwhe whiche treson loste he boþe his eyȝen
þo redde he me if þat I schal nouht lyȝen
Of Hercules and of Dyamyre
þat caused him to sett him self a fire
Noþinge forȝate he þe penance and woo
þat Socrates had wiþþe his wyues twoo
Howe þat ancippa kest pisse on his hede
þis sely man satte still as he were dede
He wype his hede no more dorst he seine
Bot or þat þonder stinte comeþ a raine
Of Phasipha þat was queene of Crete
For schrewednesse him þouht þe tale swete
Fy speke no more it  a grisely þinge
Of hire orrible lust and hir lykeinge
Of Clitermistra for hir lycherie
þat falsly maad hir husbond for to deye
He red it wiþ ful good deuocion
He told me for what occasion
Amphiorax att Thebes lost his lif
Myne husbond hadd a legent of his wife
Eriphilem þat for a nouche of golde
Haþe priuely vnto þe Grekes tolde
  
Where þat hir husbond hid him in a place
For whiche he hadd att Thebes sori grace
Off lima tolde he me  and of lucye
þei boþe maade her husbondes for to deye
That oone for loue þe toþer was for hate  
Lyma hir husbonde on euen late
Enpoysond had for þat sche was his foo
Lucia likerous loued hire husbond soo
Þat for he schold vpon hire alweie þinke
Sche ȝaue him suche a loue maner drinke
þat he was dede or it was be þe morwe
And þus algates husbondes haue sorwe
Þan tolde he me howe one latumyus
Compleynede to his felawe Arius
That in his gardyne groued suche a tre
On whiche he seide þat his wyues þre
Honged hem self for hertes dispitous
O leue broþer quod þis Arrius
ȝif me a plante of þat blisful tre
And in my gardine plantid it schal be
 Of latter date of wyues haþe he radde
Þat han sleyne here husbonde in her bedde
And lete hire lychoure diht hire al þe nyht
Whan þat þe cors laie in flore vpriht
And sum haue dreuen nayles in here brayne
While þat þei slepe and þus þei haue hem sleyne
Some haue ȝeuen poyson in my drynke
He spake more harme þan hert maie beþinke
And þerwiþal he knewe of mo prouerbes
Þan in þis werlde þer growen grasse or herbes
Bet is quod he þin habitacione
Be wiþ a leoun or a foule dragone
Þan wiþ a womman vsinge for to chide
Better is quod he hihe in þe rofe abide
Þan wiþ an angre wif doun in an hous
Þei bene so wikked and contrarious
  
þei hateþ þat her husbonde loueþ aye
He seid a womman kest hir schame awaye
Whan sche cast of hire smok and forþermo
A faire womman bot sche be chaste also
Is like a gold ringe on a sowes nose
Who walde wene or wold suppose
þe wo þat in myne hert was and pine
And whan I sawe he wolde neuer fyne
To reden on þis cursed booke al nyht
Al sodanly þre leues had I plyht
Out of his boke riht as he redde and eke  
I wiþ my fiste so toke him on þe cheke
þat in oure fire he fel bakward adoune
And he vp stert as doþe a woode lyone
And wiþ his fist he smote me on þe hede
Þat in þe flore I laie as I ware dede
And whan he sawhe howe stille þat I laie
He was agast and wolde haue fledde awaie
Til atte þast owte of myne swohe I braide
O hastowe sleyne me false þefe I seide
And for my lande þus hast þou morþerd me
Or I be dede ȝit wil I kisse þe
And nere he come and kneled faire adoune
And seide dere suster Alison
As helpe me god I schal þe neuer smyte
Þat I haue done it is þi self to wite
Forȝeue it me and þat I þe beseke
And ȝit eftsones I hitte him on þe cheke
And seide þef þus wil I me awreke
Nowe wil I deye I maie no longer speke
Bot att þe last wiþ muchel care and woo
We fell accorded be oure seluen tuoo
He ȝaue me al þe bride in myn honde
To haue þe gouernance of owse and londe
And of his tunge and of his honde also
And maade him birne his boke anone riht þo
  
And whan þat I had geten vnto me
Be maistre al þe souerainte
þan he seide myne owen trewe wif
Do as þu lyst þe terme of al my lyf
Kepe þine honoure and kepe eke my astate
After þat daie we had neuere debate
God helpe me so I was to him als kinde
As any wyf fro danmark into hinde
And also trewe and so was he to me
I praie to god þat siteþ in maieste
So blisse his sowle for his mercy dere
Nowe wil I seie my tale  if ȝe wil here
The frere lowhe whan he had herd al þis
Nowe dame quod he so haue I ioye or blis

And whan þe Somenour herde þe frere gale

Lo quod þe Somenour be goddes armes tuo
A frere wil entremete him euer mo
Lo godemen a flye and eke a frere

What spekest þow of preambulacione

Thou lettest owre disporte in þis manere
Ȝe wiltow so Somenour quod þe frere
Nowe be fey I schal or þat I go
Tell of a somenour  suche a tale or tuo

Nowe elles frere I beschrewe þi face
Quod þis Somenour and I beschrewe me
Bot I tell þe tales two or þre
Of freres ar I come to sideingborne

For wele I wote þi pacien is gone

And seide lat þe womman tel hir tale

Do dame tel forþe ȝowe tale and þat is best
Al redi sire quod sche riht as ȝow lest
Ȝif I haue lycence of þis worþi frere

IN þe olde daies of þe kinge Arthoure
Of whiche þat bretons speken grete honoure
All was þis land fulfilled of faire

Daunced witheoute in mony a grene mede

Bot now can no man see none elues mo
For þe grete charite and þe preiers
Of lymytours and of oþer pouere frers
Þat serchen euery lande and euery streme
As þikke as motes in þe sonne beme
Blissinge halles chambres bowres

For þere as was wonte to walke an elfe  
Þer walkeþ nowe þe limitour him selfe
In vndermeles and in morneynges
And seiþe his Matines and his holy þinges
As he goþ in his visitacioune
Wemmen maie go nowe sauely vpe and doune
In euery bossche or vnder euerey tre
There is none oþer Incubus bot he
And he wil do hem bot disonoure
And so fel it þat þis kinge Arþoure
Had in his house a lusty bachellier
Þat on a daie cam rideinge fro þe reuere
  
And happed alone as sche was borne
He sawhe a maiden walkinge him beforne
Of whiche maiden maugreue hire hede

For wiche oppression was suche clamoure
And suche pursuyt vnto kinge Arthoure
That dampned was þis knyht for to be dede
Be cours of lawe and scholde haue lost his hede
Parauenture suche was þe statute þo

So longe preide þe kinge of grace
Til he his him graunted in þe place
And ȝaue to þe qwene al att hir will
To chese weþer sche wolde him saue or spill

And after þis þus spak sche to þe knyht

And att þe last he chase him for to wende  
An com aȝeine riht att þe ȝeres ende
With suche answere as god wold him purueye
And takeþ his leue and wendeþ forþ his weye

To leren whatt þinge wemmen louen most

To whiche þinge schortely ansewere I schal
I seie þer was no ioye ne fest att al
Þer nas bot heuynes and muche sorwe
For priuely he wede hire on morwe
And al daie after hidde him as an owle
So woo was him his wif loked so foule
Grete was þe sorwe þe knyht had in his þouht  
Whan he was wiþ his wyf ybedde brouht
He waloweþ and torneþ to and fro
His olde  laye smyleinge euermo
And seide Dere husbonde o benedicite
Fareþ euery knyht þus wiþ his wif as ȝe
Is þis þe lawe of kinge Arþors house
Is euery knyht of his þus daungerous
I am ȝoure loue and eke ȝoure wif
I am sche whiche saued haþ ȝoure lif
And sertes ȝit dide I ȝowe neuer vnriht
Whi fare ȝe þus wiþ me þe first niht
Ȝe faren like a man þat had lost his witte
Fy what is my gilte for goddes loue tell itte
And it schal bue amended if I maie
Amend quod þis knyht nay naye
That wil nouht bue amendede neuere mo
Þou ert so loþely and so olde also
  
And þerto comen of so lowe a kinde
þat litel wonder is þouhe I walow and winde
So wolde god myne herte wolde tobreste
Is þis quod sche þe cause of ȝoure vnreste
Ȝe certeinly quod he no wonder is
Nowe sir quod sche I couþe amende al þis
If þat me list ar it were daies þre
So well ȝe myhtte bere ȝowe vnto me
Bot for ȝe speken of suche gentillese
As is descended oute of al richesse
þat þerefor scholden ȝe be gentil men
Suche errogance is nouht worþe an hen
Lo who þat most is vertuous alweie
Preue and apert and most endeþ aie
To do gentil dedes þat he can
And take him for þe grettest gentil man
Crist will we cleime of him oure gentilnes
Not of oure eldres for here olde reches
For þouhe þei ȝeue vs al her Heritage
For whiche we cleime to be of hihe parage
Ȝit may þei nouht bequeþe for no þinge
To none of vs her vertuous leueinge
That maad hem gentil men ycalled be
And bad vs folowen hem in suche degre
Wele can þe wise Poet of fflorens  
Þat hiht Dante spekeþ in þis sentens
Lo in Suche maner rim is dantes tale
Ful selde vp riseþ be his braunches smale
Prowes of man for god of his prouesse
Wil þat we of cleime oure gentillesse
For of oure helders maie we no þinge cleime
Bot temperal þinge þat man maie hirte and maheime
Eke euery white wote þis as wele as I
If gentillesse were planted naturalye
Into a certeine lignage doune þe line
Preue and aperte þan wold hey neuer fyne
  
To done of gentillesse þe faire ofice
Thei myhten do no velany nor vice
Tak fire and bere it in þe derkest house
Betwex þis and þe mount of Caucasouse
And let men schette þe dore and go þeṇne
Ȝit wil þe fire ly as fair and brenne
As þouh a M men myht it beholde
His office naturele ay wil it holde
Vp peril of lif til þat it deie
Here maie ȝe se wele howe þat genterye
Is nouht anexed to possession
Seþ folke doþ nouht her operacion
Alweie as doþe þe fire lo in his kinde
For god it wote men maie ful often finde
A lorde sone do schame and velanye
And he þat wil haue prise of his gentirye
For he was borne of a gentil hous
And hadde his heldres noble and vertuous
And nyl himseluen do no gentil dedes
Ne folowe his gentill ancestre þat dedes
He is nouht gentil be he duc or Erle
For veleyns sinful dede mak a cherle
For gentillesse ne is bot reuente
Of þine Auncestres for hire bente
Whiche is a stronge þinge for þi persone
The gentilles comeþ fro god alone
Than comeþ oure verraie gentilles of grace
He was noþinge bequeþe vs wiþ oure place
Thinkeþ howe noble as seiþ valerius
Was þilke tullius hostilius
That oute of pouert ros to hihe noblesse  
Redeþ Senec and rede eke Boesse
There schold ȝe seen expresse þat it no drede is
That is gentil þat doþe gentil dedes
And þerfore dere husbonde I þus conclude
Al were þat myne Ancestres were so rude
  
Ȝit maie þat hihe god and so hope I
Graunt me grace to leue vertuously
Than am I gentil whan þat I beginne
To leuen vertuously and weuen sinne
 And þare as ȝe of pouert me repreue
The hihe god on whom þat we beleue
In wilful pouert ches to leue his lif
And certes euery man and maide and wif
Maie vnderstonde ihesu heuen kinge
Ne wold nouȝt chese a vicious leueinge
Glad pouert is an honest þinge certeigne
This wil senec an oþere clerkes seine
Who so þat holde him paide of his pouert
I holde him riche al had he nouht sert
He þat coueteþ is a pouer wight
For he wold haue þat is nouht in his myht
Bot þat nouht haþe ne coueteþ to haue
Is riche alþouhe men holde him bot a knaue
Verray pouert is sinne propurly
Iuuenal seiþe of pouert merely
The pore man whan he goþ be þe waye
Befor þe þeues he maie singe and pleye
Pouert is hatel good and as I gesse
A ful grete bringer oute of besinesse
A gre amender eke of Sapience
To him þat lakkeþ it in pacience
Pouer is þis al þouhe it seme Alinge
Possessione þat no wyht wil chalinge
Pouert ful oft whan a ma is lowe
Makeþ his and eke him self to knowe
Pouert in spektacle is as þenkeþ me
Þourhe whiche he maie his verray frende se
And þere sen þat I ȝowe nouȝt greue
Of my pouert no more me repreue
Nowe sire of elde ȝe preue me
And certes sir þoruhe none auctorite
  
Wher in no boke ȝe gentil of honoure  
Seine þat men scholde an olde wife do fauoure
And clepe her moder for her gentillesse
An Auctours schal I finde as I gesse
Nowe þere ȝe seine þat I am foule and olde
Þan drede ȝowe nouht to be no cokewolde
For filþe and helþe as mot I þe
Bene grete werdeins vpon chastite

Chese nowe quod sche one of þis þinges tweye
To haue me foule and olde til þat I deie
And be to ȝowe a trewe humble wif
And neuer ȝoue displese in al my lif
Or elles ȝe wil haue me ȝonge and faire
And take ȝoure auenture of þe repaire
That schal com to ȝoure house be cause of me
Or in sume oþere place wel maie be
Nowe chese ȝoure seluen wheþer þat ȝou likeþ
This knyht avised him and sore he sikeþ
Bot att þe last he seide in þis manere

Gesseþ ȝoure self whiche maie be most plesaunce
And most honour to ȝowe and me also

For as ȝowe likeþ it sufficet me
Than haue I gete of ȝowe þe maistre quod sche

Ȝe sertes wif quod he I holde it for þe best
Kisse me quod sche we be no longer wroþe
For be my trowþe I will be to ȝowe boþe
Þis is seine to be to ȝowe boþe feire and goode
I praie to god þat I mot steruen woode
Bot I to ȝowe be also sadde and trewe
As euer was wif sen þat þe werlde was newe
  
And bot I be to morwe also faire to seen
As any lady Emperes or qween

Do wiþ my lif and deþe riht as ȝow lest

For ioy he hent hir in his armes tuo

Parde I maie wele knowe be þi name

A Somnour is a romer vp and doune
Wiþ a mendement of fornicacioune
And is Ibette att euery tounes ende
Owre þan spake a sir ȝe scholde be hende
And curteis as man of ȝoure astate
In compaignie we wil no debate
Telleþ ȝoure tale and lateþ þe somenour be

Be god I schal him qwite euery grote

It is to be  flateringe limitour
And of ful mony anoþer crime

Whilom þere was dwelinge in myne contre
An Archedeken a man of hihe degre
That boldely dide execucion
In poneschinge of fornicacione
Of whiche craft and eke of baudrye
Of diffamacion and avowtrie
Of cherche reues and of testamentes
Of contractes and of lac of sacramentes
Of vsury and of Simony also
Bot certes Lychoures dede he grettest woo
Thei scholden singe if þei wer hente
And smale tiþers weren fowle schente
If any person wolde vpon hem pleine
There myht astert him no pecuniale peyne
For smale tiþes and eke smale offringe
He maade þe peple spitusly to singe
For or þe bischop cauht hem wiþ his hoke
Thei were in þe Archedecanes boke
And þan hadde he þoruhe his Iurdictione
Power to done on hem Correctione
He had a somnoure redy to his hand
A slyhere boye was none in yngelande
For Sotely he had his especiaile
That tauht him where he myht availe
He couþe spare of lychours one or tuo
To techen him to foure · and twenty mo
ffor þouhe þis somnour woode were as an hare
To tel his harlotry I wil nouȝt spare
  
For we bue oute of her correctione

Thus seid owre oste and late him tel his tale
Now telleþ forþe and lete þe Somnour gale

And þei weere glad to fill his purs
And maade him grete festis att nale
Riht as Iudas had purse smale
And was a þeef riht suche a þeef was he
His maister had bot half his Dewte
He was if I schal ȝeuen him his laude
An þeef and eke a somnour and a baude

That wheþer sir Robert or sir hewe
Or Iohn or Raufe or who þat it wer

Ande he wolde feche a feyned maundement

For in þis werlde is no doge for þe bowe

And for þat was þe fruyte of al þe rente

Feynein a cause for he wald bribe
And happed þat he sauhe tofor him ride

This frere bosteþ þat he knoweþ hell
As god wote þat is litel wonder
Freres and fendes ben bot litel in sunder
For parde ȝe haue oft time herd tell
How þat a frere rauisshed was in hell
In spiret ones be a visione
And as Angel led him vp and downe
To schewen him þe peynes þat þere were
In al þe place sawe he nouȝt a frere
Of oþer folke he sawe ynowe in woo
Vnto þis Angel spak þe frere þoo
Now sir quod he haue freres suche grace
þat none of hem schal com into þis place
ȝis quod þis Aungel mony a melione
And vnto Sathanas he had him adoune
And now haþ Sathanas saiþ he taile
Bradder þan of þ Carrik is þe seile
Holde vp þi taile þu Sathanas quod he
Schewe forþe þin erse and let þe frere se
Where is þe nest of freres in þis place
And ar þat halue a forlonge waie of space
  
Riht so as bees swarme oute of an hive
Owte of þe deuels ers þei gon drive
twenty þousand freres on a rowte
And þouht hell swarme al aboute
An comen aȝeine als fast as þei maie gone
And in his hars þei crepen euerychone
He clapped his taile aȝeine and leye still
This frere whan he loked had his fill
Vpon þis tormentes vpon þis sor place
His spirit god restored of his grace
Vnto his body aȝeine and he awoke
Bot naþeles for fere ȝit he qwoke
So was deueles ars aie in his mynde

God saue ȝoue al saue þis curse frere
My prologe wil I ende in þis Manere
LOrdeynges þere is in ȝorkeschire as I gesse
A merschy contre called holdernesse
In whiche þere went a limitour aboute
To preche and eke to bigge it is no doute  
And so befell þat on a daie þis frere
Hadde preched att þe cherche in þis manere
And specialy aboue euery þinge
He excited þe peple in his precheinge
To trentals and for goddes saake

Nouȝt þere as is wasted and deuoured
Ne þere it nedeþ nouht for to be ȝeue

Nouht for to holde a preste Iolif and gaie

And wrote þe names alweie as he stode
Of euery folke þat ȝaue hem any goode
Askaunse þat he wolde for hem preie

And what men ȝaue hem laide on his bakke
And he was out att þe dore anone

Vengaunce is þan al þat þei desire

Ire in soþe is executor of pride

Amiddes his honde he lete þe frere a fart
Þare is no capel draweinge in þe cart

Of hire araye what scholde I maake a tale

Of þewes goode sette in hihe bounte

So benigne and digne of reuerence

If one seide wele a noþer seide þe same
So spredeþe of hire hihe bounte and fame
That men and wemmen also wele ȝonge as olde

 Thus Walter lowly nouȝt but royalye

And him presenteþ wiþ his douhter dere
Somwhat þis lorde had reuþe in his manere
Bot naþeles his purpos helde he still
As lordes done whan þei wil haue here will
 And badde þis sergeant þat he priuely
Scholde þis childe ful oft wynde and wrappe
Wiþ al circumstance tenderly
And Carie it in a cofer or in a lappe
Bott vppon peine his hede of for to swappe
Þat no man scholde knowe of his entente
Ne whene ne whedere þat he wente

Besecheinge hire to tone hir besinesse

And whos childe þat it was he bad hire hide
Frome euery whiht for ouhte þat maie betide

For nowe goþe he ful oft ymagyneinge

Or be hir worde perceyue þat sche  
Were chaunged bot he neuer couþe hir finde

 As gladde as besy as humble in seruise
And eke in loue as sche was wont to be
Was sche to him in euery manere wise
Ne of hir douhter nouht a worde spak sche
Accident for none aduersite

IN þis  astate þere ben passed foure ȝere
Er sche wiþ childe was Bot as god wolde
A knaue childe sche bare be þis waltere
Ful gracious and faire to beholde
And whan þat folke it to his fader tolde
Nouht onlyche he but al þe contre mury

Departid of his norice on a daye

To tempte his wif ȝit ofter if he maie
O nedeles was sche tempted in assaie
Bot wedded men knowen no mesure
Whan þat þei finde a pacient creature
 Wif quod þis Markes ȝe haue herde of þis
My peple sekely bereþ heuye of oure mariage
And namely seþ my son borne is
Nowe is wers þan euer in al oure age
The mormure sleþe myn herte and myne corage
For to myne eres commeþ voice so smarte
That it wel nyhe destruyde hathe myne herte
 Nowe seye þei þus whan Waltier is agone
Than schal þe blode of Ianicle succede
And bien oure lorde for oþere haue we none
Suche wordes seiþe my peple it is no drede
Wele ouhte I of suche murmure taken hede
For certeinly I drede suche sentence
Þouhe þei nouht pleine speke in myne audience

Wherefore I am disposed vtterlye

Thus warne I ȝowe for ȝe nouht sodanly
Oute of ȝoure selue for no woo scholde outraie

For as I left att home al my cloþinge
Whan I first came to ȝowe riht so quod sche
Lest I my wil and al my liberte
And toke ȝoure cloþinge wherefore I ȝowe preie
Doþe ȝoure plesance I wil ȝoure lust obeie
 And certes if I had prescience

Bot nowe I wote ȝoure luste and what ȝe wolde
Al ȝoure plesance ferme and plesance I holde
For wist I þat my deþe wolde do ȝowe ese
Riht gladly wolde I deie ȝowe to plese
 Deþ maie nouht make no comparisone
Vnto owre loue and whan þis Markis seye
Þe Countenance of his wif he cast adoune
His eyȝen tuo and wonderþ þat sche maye
In paciens suffur al þis araye
And forþe he goþ wiþ drery countenance
Bot to his hert it was riht grete plesance
 Þis Ogel seriant in þe same wise
Þat he hir douhte cauht riht so he
Or wers if men wers can deuise
Haþe hente hire son þat ful was of beute
And euer in oone so paciente was sche
That sche no chiere made of heuinesse
Bott kissed hir son and after gan it blesse
 Saue þis sche praide him if þat he myht
Hir litel son he wolde in erþe graue

Fro foules and fro bestes forto saue    
Bot sche none ansewere of him myht haue
He went his waie as he no þinge rouht
Bot to Boleigne he tendurly it brouht
 This Markes wondreþ euer lenger þe more
Vpon hire paciens and if þat he
Ne hadde soþely knowe þere before
Þat perfitly hir cheldern loued sche
He wolde haue wende þat of summe subtilite
And of Males or for cruel curage
Þat sche hadde sufferd þis wiþ sadde visage
 Bot wele he knewe next him selue certeigne
Sche loued hir childern best in euery wise
Bot nowe of wemmen wolde I axe feine
If þes assaies myht nouht suffise
What couþe a stordy husbonde more deuyse

And he continuinge euer in stordenesse
 Bot þere buen folke of suche condicione
þat whan þe haue a certeine purpos take

Bot riht as þei were bounden to a stake
þai wil nouht of þat first purpos slake
Riht so þis makes fully haþe purposyd
To tempt his wif as he was firste disposyd
 He waiteþ if be worde or countenance
That sche to him was chaunged of Corage
Bot neuer couþe he finde variance
Sche was aie oon in hert and in visage
And aie þe forþer sche was in age
The more trewe if þat it were possible
Sche was to him loue and more pesible
  
 For whiche it semed þus þat of hem tuo
Þer nas bot o will for as Waltier luste
Þat same lust was hir plesance also
And god he þonked as fel for þe beste
Sch schewed wele for no werldly vnreste
A wif as of hire self no þinge ne scholde
Wille in effecte bot as hir husbonde wolde
 The sclander of Walter oft and wide spradde
That of a cruel hert he wikkedly
For he a pouer womman wedded hadde
Had murdred boþ his childern priuely  
Suche murmur was ymonge hem comunly
No wonder is for to þe peples ere
Þere come no worde bot þat þei murdred were
 ffor whiche þer as his peple þere before
Had loued him wel þe sclaunder of his defame
Maade hem þat þei hated him þerfore
To biene a Mordrer is an hateful name
Bot naþeles for ernest ne for game
He of his crewel purpos nold stint
To tempte his wif was sette al his entent
 Whan þat his douhter  xij ȝere was of age

Enformed of his will and sente his message
Commandeinge hem suche bulles to douise
In þis manere and in þis same gise
Howe þat þe pope for his peple rest
Bat him to wedde anoþer wif ȝif þat him lest

Betwix his peple and him þus spake þe bulle
The whiche þei han publisced att þe fulle

Disposed was þis humble creature
To aduersite of fortune al to endure
 Abideinge euer his lust and his plesaunce
To wham sche was ȝeuen hert and al
As to hir werldly verray suffisance
Bot schortly ȝif þis storie tell I schal
This Marqwys writen haþe in special
A lettre in whiche he scheweþ his entent
And secretely he to Boleigne it sent
 To þe erle of pauyke whiche þat hadde þo
Wedded his suster prayede he specialy
To bringe home aȝeine his childerne two

Wiþ all his hert ful affectuously
Þat he to no wight þouh man wolde enquere
Schol nouht tellen whos childen þat þei were

Vnto þe Markes of Salucez riht anone
And as þis Erle was preide riht so dide
For att þe daie sette  he on his waie is gone

And þus in grete noblesse and wiþ gladde chiere

Ful bustusly haþ seide hir þis sentence
 Certes Crisilde I had Inowhe plesance
To haue ȝowe to my wif for ȝoure goodnesse

Retorneþ to ȝoure faders house quod he

 And sche aȝeine ansewarde in pacience

 And in þis þere ȝe me lady maade

Þat I ȝowe ȝafe myne herte in hole entent

And richely me cladden of ȝoure grace

For euer it demed siþþe it first began

To wedde one of so pouere a lignage
To his astate so lowe to a lyht
And voide hir as sone as euer he myht

For he be noyse of folke knewe hire comeinge
And wiþ hire olde cote as it miht be

For rude was þe cloþe and more of age

Discrete and prideles ay honurable
And to hir husbond euere meke and stable

Namely of men bot as in sothefastnesse  
Thow clerkes preisen wemmen bo a lite

Of whiche þe fame vp spronge to more and lesse
And to þe peple eres al and somme

 For sche is fairere as þei demen alle

And richely his douhter maried he

Of all ytaile þan and pees and rest

In reste and pes after his fader daie
And fortunate eke was in mariage

 For seþþe a womman was so paciente
Vnto a mortel man wele more vs ouht
Receyuen al in gre þat god vs sente
For grete skylles he proueþ þat he wrouht

As seiþe seinte Iame if ȝe his pistel rede

 And suffreþ vs as for oure exercise
Wiþ scharpe scourges of aduersite
Ful often to be beten in sundry wise
Nouȝt for to knowe oure wil for certes he
Or we ware borne knewe al oure frelete
And for oure best is al his gouernance
Lete vs þan leue in vertuous suffrance
 Bot lordinges o worde herkeneþ ar I go
It ware ful harde to finde nowe a dayes
In al a toune Crisildes one or tuo
For if þat þei were put to suche assaies
The golde of hem haþe nowe so bad laies
Wiþ bras þat þouhe þe coyne be faire at eye
It wolde raþer briste y tuo þan plye
 For whiche for þe wyues loue of baþe
Whas lyf and al here helþe god maynteigne
In hire maystre and elles ware it skaþe
I wolde wiþ lusty herte frische and grene
Sey ȝowe a songe to glad ȝowe I wene
And latte us stint of enestful matiere
Herkeneþ my songe þat seiþe in þis manere
Criselde is dede and hir pacience
And boþe at ones beried in ytaile
Wherfore I crie in open audience
No wedded man be hardie to assaile
His wives pacience in hope to finde
Crisildez for certes he schal faile
  
O noble wyues ful of ire prudence
Lat none humylite ȝoure tonge naile
Ne late no clerke haue cause or diligence  
To write of ȝowe a storie of suche merveile
As Crisilde pacient and kinde
Lest chicheuache ȝowe swelowe in hire entreile
Foloweþ here to and holdeþ no silence
Bot euer answer att þe countretaile
Beþ nouht bedaffed for ȝoure innocence
Bot scharpely take on ȝowe þe gouernaile
Enprinteþ wele þis lesson in ȝoure mynde
For commune profite seþþe it maie availe
þe Archewyues standeþ att þe fense
Seþ ȝe be stronge as is a grete Camaile
Ne suffreþ nouȝt þat men do ȝowe offence
And sclender wives and febel as in a bataile
Beþ egre as is a tigre ȝonde in Inde
Ay clappeþ as a melle I ȝowe counseile
Ne drede hem nouht  ne do hem no reuerence
For þouhe þi husbonde armed be in maile
Þe arwes of þi crabbed eloquence
Schal pers his breste and eke his aduentaile
In gelowsye I rede eke þou him binde
And þou make him couche as doþe a qwaile
If þow bue faire þere folke bue in presence
schew þou þi visage and þine aparaile
If þo be foule be fre of þi dispence
To gete þe frendes do aye þi trauayle
Be ay of chier as liht as lef on lynde
And late him care and wepe and wringe and wayle
WHilome þer was dwellinge in lumbardie
A worþi knyht þat borne was in Paue
In whiche he leued in grete prosperite
And xl ȝere a wifles man was he
And folowde aye his bodely delite
On wemmen was his hole appetite
As done þes foles þat bu seculere
And whan þat he was passed lx ȝere
Were it for holynes or for dotage
I can nouht seie but suche a grete corage
Had þis knyht to be a wedded man

1Þat daie and nyht he doþ al þat he can
To aspie where he myht wedded be1
Preinge oure lorde to grant him þat he  
myht ones knowe þat blisful life
þat is betwex an husbond and his wif
And for to leue vnder þat holy honde
Wiþ wiche god first man and womman bonde
None oþer life seide he is worþe a bene
For wedlok is so esy and so clene
That in þis werlde it is a paradise
Thus seide þis olde knyht þat was so wise
An certeinly as soþe as godde is kenge
To take a wif it is a gloriouse þinge
And namely whan a man is olde and hore
þan is a wif fruyt of his tresore
þan scholde he take a ȝonge wif and a faire
On whiche he myht engender him an heire
  
And leden his lif in Ioy and solace
Where as þe bachellier singen alace
Whan þat þei finden any aduersite
In loue whiche þat is bot childes vanite
And trewli it sitte wele to be so
þat bachilliers haue ofte peine and woo
On brutel grounde þei boiled brutilnesse
þei finde frelte whan þei wene Sikernesse
þei leue bot as a burde or as a beste
In liberte and vnder none areste
þere as a wedded man in his astate
Leueþ  his lyf blisful and ordinate
Vnder þe ȝokke of mariage ybounde
Wele may his herte In Ioy and blisse abounde
For who can be so buxum as a wife
Who is so trewe and eke so tentife
To kepe him seeke and hole as is his make
For wele or woo sche nyll nouht him forsake
Sche is nouht werye him to loue and serue
þeih þat he lye beddred til he sterue
And ȝit somme clerkes seine it is nouht so
Of whiche Theofrast is one of þo
What fors þouhe Theofrast list lye
Ne take no wif quod he for husbandrie
As for to spare in householde þi despence
A trew seruant doþe more diligence  
Thine goode to kepe þan þine owen wif
For sche wil claime half parte in al hire lif
And ȝif þat þou be seke so god me saue
Thyne verrey frendes or a trew knaue
Wil kepe þe bett þan sche þat waiteþ aie
After þi goode and haueþ do mony daie

ffull ofte tyme it schall the rewe  
To þis entente and an C siþes wers
Writeþ þis man þere god his soule cors
  
Bot take no kepe of al such vanite
Defye Theofrast and herkeneþ me
 A wif is goddes ȝift verraily
Al oþer maner ȝiftes hardely
As landes rentes pasture or comune
Oþer eyþer ȝiftes þat bien mebles of fortune
þat passen as a schadowe on a wal
Bot drede nouht if pleinly speke I schal
A wif wil last and in þine house endure
Wel langer þan þe list endure
Mariage is a ful grete sacrament
He whiche haþ no wif I holde him schent
He leueþ helples and is al desolate
I speke of folke in seculere astate
And herken whi I seie nouht þis for nouht

And sauhe him alone bly nakeded

Latt vs nowe make an helpe to þis man
Ilike to him selfe and þat he maade Eue
Here maie ȝe see and here be preue
Þat wif is mannes help and comforte
His paradise terestre and his disporte
So buxum and so vertuus is sche

O flesche and o blode as I gesse
Ne haþe bot on herte in wele and in destresse
A wif a seinte mare benedicite
Howe myhte a man haue any aduersite

The blisse þat is betuex hem tueye
Þere maie no tunge tel or hert þinke
If he be pouere Sche helpeþ him to swynke  
Sche kepeþ his gode and wasteþ neuer a dele
And al þat hire husbond lust hire lykeþ wele
  
Sche seiþ nouht ones naie whan he seiþe ȝe
Doþ þis saiþe he Alredy sire seiþ sche
O blisful order o wedlok precious

And so commended and approued eke

Vpon his bare knees ouht al his lif
Thonken his god þat him haþ sente a wif
Oþire praie god him for to sende
A wif to last vnto his lyues ende
For þan his lif is sett in sekurnesse
He may nouhte be deceiued as I gesse
So þat he worche after his wyues rede
þan maie he boldely bere vp his hede
þei buen so trewe and so wise
For wiche if þou wilt worchen as þe wise
Do al waie so as þe womman wil þe reede
Lo howe þat Iacob as þes clerkes rede

Bande þe kidde scynne aboute his nek
For whiche his faders benison he wan
Lo Iudith as þe storie eke tel can
Be wise Counsel sche goddes peple kept
And slowhe him Olofernus while he slept
Lo howe Abigaile be gode counsel howe þat sche
Saued hir husbond nabal whan þat he

Be goode counsel deliuerd out of wo

A wif is keper of þin husbondrie

Loue wele þi wif as crist loueþ his chirche

No man hateþ his flesche bot in his lif

He was so rauisshed on his lady maie
Þat for þe verraie peine he wex nere wode
Almoste he suelte and swouned þere he stode
  
As þat sche bare daunceinge in hire honde
So fressche sche was and þerto so likeande
And to his bed he went him hastely
No more of him att þis time speke I
Bote I lete him wepe ynowe and pleine
Til frische maie wil rewe on his peine
O perelous fire þat in þe bedde strawe bredeþ
O famylere foo þat is seruise bedeþ
O seruant traitur fals holy hiew
ylyke to þe nadder sleiȝe and in bosom vntrewe
God schelde vs al fro ȝoure iniquitance
O Ianuere dronken in plesance
O mariage see how þine Damyan
þine owen swyer and þine borne man
Entendeþ to do þe velanye
God grant þe þine harme to aspie
For in þis werlde ne is wers pestilence
Þan humble fo aldaie in þi presence
Performed haþ þis devine daie his ark diurne
No longer maie þe bodie of him soiorne
The oriȝote as in þat latitude
Niht wiþ his mantil þat is derke and rude
Gan for to sprede þe mysprei aboute
For whiche departed is þe lusti route
For Ianuer wiþ þonke on euery side
Home to her houses lustely þei ride
þer as þei done her þinges as hem lest
And whan þei sawe her time go to rest
Sone after þat þis hastif Ianuare
Wil go to bedde he wil no longer care
He drinkeþ ypocras clarre and vernage  
Of spices ote to encresen his corage
And many a letuarie had he ful fyne
Suche as þe Cursed Monke Dam Constantine
Haþe wreten in his boke of coitue
To eten hem al he was noþinge eschewe
  
And þus to his priue frendes saide he
For goddes loue as sone as it may be
Late voyden al þis house in curteis wise sone
Men dronke and þe trauers droue anone
þe bride was brouht to bedd as stil as stone
So hasted Ianuarie it most be done

Owte of þe chambre haþ euery wyght him dressed
And Ianuare haþe fast in armes take
His frisshe maie his paradis his maake
He lulliþ hire he kisseþ hir ful oft
Wiþ þilke bristeles of his berde vnsoft
ylike to þe skinne of hundefische scharpe as brere
For he was schaue al newe in his manere
He rubbeþ hir vpon hire tender face
And seid þus alas I must trespace
To ȝowe my spowse and ȝowe gretely offende
Or time come þat I wil downe descende
Bot naþeles considereþ þis quod he
þer nys no werkman whatt so euere he be
þat maie boþe werche wele and hastelye
This wil be done att leyser parfitelye
It is no force howe lon þat we pleye
I troue in wedlok complete be we tueye
And yblissed be þat ȝok þat we bue inne
For in oure actes we mowe do no sinne
A man maie do no sinne wiþ his wif
Ne hurt him self wiþ his owen knyf
Nowe we haue leue to pley vs be þe lawe
Thus laboureþ he til þat þe daie gun dawe
And þan he takeþ a soppe in fine clarre
And vp riht in his bedde þan sitteþ he
And after þat he songe ful loude and clere
An kessed his wif and maade wantoun chere
He was al coltisshe and ful of ragerie
And ful of Girgun as is a flecked pye
  
The slake skynne aboute his necke sshakeþ
While þat he songe so chaunteþ he and crakeþ
Bot god woote watt maie ȝouþe in hire hert  
Whan sche him sawhe vpsitinge in his schert
In hys nyht cappe and wiþ his nek lene
Sche preiseþ nouht his pleyinge worþe a bene
Than saide he þus Mi ristinge wil I take
Nowe daie is comme I maie no lenger wake
And doune he laide his hed and slept to prime
And afterward whan þat he sawhe his time
Vpriseþ Ianuer bot þe frisshe maie
Holdeþ hir chambre vnto þe ferþe daie
As vsages is for wives for þe best
For euery loboure som time mote haue rest
Oþere elles longe maie he nouht endure
This is to seie no liues creature
Be it of fisshe or birde or beste or man
 Nowe wil I speke of woful Danyan
þat longuriþ for loue as ȝe schol here
The for I speke to him in þis manere
I seye o cely Damyan alas
Ansewer to þis demaunde as in þis cas
How schal tow to þi lady fresshe maie
Tel þi woo sche wil al weie seie naie
Eke if þou speke sche wil þi wo bewreye
God bu þin helpe I can no better seie
This seke Damyan in venus fire
So berneþ þat he deyeþ for desire
For whiche he put his lif in aduenture
Ne lenger myht he in þis wise endure
Bot priuely a pennere gan he borwe
And in a lettre wrote he al his sorwe
In manere of a compleint oþere a laie
Vnto þis faire and fresshe lady maie
And in a purse of silke honge on his schert
He haþ it put and leide it att his hert
  
The mone þat att none was þat ilke daie
Þat Ianuar haþe wedded þat fressche maie
In tuo of taure was in þe Cankre gliden
So longe haþe sche in hir chambre byden
As custume is vnto þis noblis all
A bride schal nouhte eten in þe hall
Til daies foure oþere þre att leste
Ipassed buen þan late hir go to feste
The fourte daie complete fro none to none  
Whan þat þe hihe messe was done
In hall sitteþ þis Ianuer and maie
As fresshe as is þe briht somers daie
And so befel howe þat þis goode man
Remembreþ him vpon þis Damian
And seide seinte marie howe maie þis be
þat Damyan entendeþ nouht to me
Is he aie seke or howe maie þis betide
His swyers whiche þat stoden him beside
excuseinge him be cause of his sekenesse
Whiche þat letid him to done his besinesse
None oþere cause myht make him care
That me forþinkeþ quod þis Ianuare
He is a gentil swyer be my trouþe
If þat he deie it were harme and rouþe
He is as wise discrete and secre
As any man I wote of his degre
And þerto manly and eke seruisable
And for to be a þrifty man riht able
Bot after mete as sone as euer y maie
I wil my self viset him and eke maie
To done him al þe comfort þat I can
And for þat worde blissed him euery man

He wolde so comforten him in his sekenesse
His swyere for it was a gentil dede
Dame quod he þis Ianuare takeþ good hede
  
Att þe after mete ȝe wiþ ȝoure wemmen all
Whan ȝe haue buen in chambre oute of þis hall

Doþe him disporte he is a gentile mon
And telleþ him þat I wil him vesyte
Haue I noþinge bot rest me a lyte

Til that ye slepe faste be my syde  
Nowe wiþ þat worde he gan to him call
A swyer þat was marchal of his hall
And tolde him certeine þinges whatt he wolde
This frische maie haþ streiht her weie yholde
Wiþ al hire wemmen vnto þis Damyan
Doune be his bed side satt sche þan
Comforteing him as goodly as sche maie
This Damyan whan þat he his tim saie
In secrete wise his purse and eke his bille  
In whiche þat he had wreten al his wille
Haþ pute in to hir honde wiþouten more
Saue þat he syked wonder sore
And soþe to hir riht þus seide he

For I am dede if þat þis þinge be kidde
This purs haþ sche inne withe hire bosome hidde
And went hir waie ȝe gette no more of me
Vnto Ianuer Commen is sche
An on his bedde side sitte ful soft
He takeþ hir and kisseþ hire ful oft
And leide him doune to slepe and þat anone
Sche feyne hir þat sche most gone

And whan sche of þis bill haþ taken hede
Sche rent it al to cloutes atte þe last
And in þe priue softly sche it cast
Who stodieþ nowe bot faire fresche maie
And adoune be Ianuare sche laie
  
That slepet til þat þe couhe him haþ awaked
Anone he preide hire to stripen hire al naked
He wolde of hire he seide haue sum plesance
He seide hire cloþes did him encumbrance
And sche obeieþ be he leef or loþe
Bot lest þat precious folke be wiþ me wroþe
How þat he wrouht I dar to ȝowe nouht tell
Oþere wheþer þat he þouht on paradis or of hell
Bot I lete hem werche in here wise
Te euesonge ringe and þat þei mot arise
Were it be destany or aueuture
Were it be influence or be nature
Oþer in constillacione þat in suche astate
The heuen stoode þat time fortunate
Was for to putte a bil of venus werkes
For al þinge haþe time as seiþe þe clerkes
To any womman for to gete hire loue
I kan not sei bot þe grete god aboue

He deþ of al for I wil holde my pes
Bot soþe is þis howe þat þis maie
Haþ take suche impression þat daie
On pite on þis seke Damyan  
That fro hir herte sche ne driue can
The remembrance for to done him ese
Certeine þouht sche whome þat þis þinge displese
I rek nouȝt for here I him assure
To loue him beste of any creature
Thouhe he no more hadde þan his scherte
Lo pite renneþ sone in gentile herte
Here maye ȝe see howe excellent fraunches
In wemmen is whan þei narwe hem avise
Sum terant þere is as þere be mony one
That haþ an herte as hard as any stone
Whiche wolde haue late him sterue in þe place
Wel raþare þan haue graunted him þat grace
  
And hem reioysen in þeire crouel pride
And reccheþ nouȝt to bue an homycide
This gentil maie ful filled of al pite
Riht so of hire honde a letter maade sche
In whiche sche graunteþ him of hire verraie grace
Thar lakeþ nouht onely bot daie and place
Where þat sche miht to his lust suffice
For it schal bue riht as he wil deuise
And whan sche see hire tim vpon a daie
To visite þis Damyan goþe þis faire maie
And sotelly þis letter doune sche þrest
Vnder his pilowe rede if him lest
Sche takeþ him be þe honde and harde him tueste
So secretely þat no whight it weste
And bad him be al hole and forþe sche wente
To Ianuare whan þat he for hire sente
Vp riseþe Damyan þe next morwe
Al passed was his sekenes and his sorwe
He kembeþ him and proyneþ and pikeþ
He doþ al þat his lady luste and likeþ
And eke to Ianuare he goþe as lowe
As euere dide a doge for þe bowe
He is so plesante to euery man
Fro craft it is who þat it can
þat euery whight is feine to teche him goode
And fully in his ladie grace he stode
Thus lete I Damyan aboute his nede
And my tale forþe I wil procede
Somme clerkes halden þat felicite  
Stant in delite and þarefor he
This Noble Ianuare wiþ al his myht
In honest wise as longeþ to a knyht
Schope him to leue ful deliciously
His houseynge his arraie al honestly
To his degre was maked as kenges
Amonge oþere of his honest þinges
  
He had a grardyne al walled wiþ stone
So faire a gardyne wote I ney where none
For oute of doute I verraily suppose
þat he þat wrote þe romans of þe rose
Ne couþe of it þe bewte wele deuise
Ne Priapus ne miht noȝt suffise
Þouhe he be god of Gardyns for to telle
The beute of þe gardyn and of þe welle
That vnder a laurer alwaie grene
Ful oft time kinge Pluto and his queene
Preserpina and all hire fairee
Disporten hem and maken melodee
Abouten þat wel and daunced as men tolde
This noble knyht þis Ianuare þe olde
Suche deinte haþ in hit to walken and to pleie
That he wil suffur no wyht to be þe kaie
Saue he him self for of þe smale wiket
He bare alwaie of siluer a kleket
Wiþ þe whiche whan þat him vnschette
And whan he walde paie his wif hire dette
In somer seson þeder wolde he goo
And maie his wiff and no whiht bot þei tuoo
An þinges whiche þat were nouht done abedde
þei in þe Gardeine performed haue and spedde
And in þis wise mony a mery daie
Leued þis Ianuare and fressche maie
Bott werldly Ioy mai nouht alweie endure
To Ianuare ne to no werldly creture
O sodeine happe o þou fortune vnstable
Ilyke to þe  þe scorpion vnstable

Thi taile  is deþ þoruhe þine enuenymynge
O brutel ioye O swete poyson queynte
O mynester þat solely can peinte
Thin ȝeftes vnder þe hewe of stedfastnesse  
þat þou deceyuedest boþe more and lesse
  
Whi hast þou Ianuer þus deceyued
And haddest him for þi ful frende receyued
And now þou hast beraft him boþ his eyen
For sorwe of whiche desireþ he to deiȝen
Alas þis noble Ianuare þat is so fre
Amydde his luste and his prosperite
Is waxon blinde and al sodanly
His deþ þerefor desireþ he vtterly
And þerewiþal þe fire of Ielousye
Lest þat his  schold fall in sum folye
So bernt his hert þat wolde feine
Thatt summe man boþe hir and him had sleine
For neuer after his deþ ne in his lif
Ne wolde he þat sche were loue ne wif
Bot euer leue as a wedew in cloþes blake
Soule as a tortle doþe þat haþ lost hir make
Bot att þe last after a Moneþ or tuey
His sorwhe gan to swage soþe to sey
For whan he wiste it mai none oþer be

Saf oute of doute maie he noȝt forgone
Þat he nas Ielous euer more in one
Whiche Ielouse it was so outrageous
þat neiþere in hal ne in none oþere hous
Ne in none oþere place neuer þe mo
He nold suffre hir neyþer ride nor go
Bot if þat he hande on hire alweie
For whiche ful of wepeþ frische maye

Or elles sche most han him att hire lust
Sche waiteþ whan hire hert wald birst
Vppon þat oþer side Damyan

Þat euer was for neiþer niht ne daie
Ne myht he speke a worde to fresche maie
  
As to his purpos of no suche matier

And neuer les be writeinge to and fro
An priue signes wist he what sche ment  
And sche knewe of þe syne of his entent
O Ianuare what myht þe availe

For also good is a blynde deceyued be

In warme wax haþe emprintid þis cliket
Þat Ianuare bare of þat smale wiket

And Damyan þat knewe hire entent

Some wonder be his cleket scha betide

O noble Ouide soþe seist þou god woote

That he nil finde it oute in somme manere

Whan Maistre commeþ god of loue anone
Beteþ on his wenge and fare wele he is gone
Loue is a þinge as any spirit fre
Wemmene of kinde desiren liberte
  
And nouht to be constreined as a þrall
And so doþ men if I þe soþe saie schall
Loke who þat is most pacient in loue
He is att auantage aboue
Paciens is an hihe vertue certeigne

Thinges þat Rigor schol neuere atteigne
For euery worde men maie nouht chide ne pleine
Lereneþ to suffur or elles so must I gone
Ȝe scholne it leren wheþer so ȝe wol or none
For in þis werlde certeine no wight ne is
þat he ne doþ or seiþe sum time of mys
Or eiþer sekenes or constillacione
Wyn wo or channgeinge of complexione
Causeþ ful often to don amys or speken
On euery wronge men maye nouht bue awreken
After þe time most be temperance
To euery whiht þat can no gouernance
And þerfore haþe þis worþe wise knyht
To leue in ese suffrance hir behiht
And sche to him ful wiseli gan to swere
þat neuere scholde be defaute in hire
Here maie men seen an humble wise accorde
Thus haþ sche take hire seruant and hir lorde
Seruant in loue and lorde in Mariage
þan was he boþe in lordeschipe and seruage
Seruage naye bot in lordeschip aboue
Seþen þat he haþ boþe his ladi and his loue
His lady certes and his wif also  
The whiche þat lowe of loue accordeþ þarto
And whan he was in þis prosperite
Home wiþ his wif he goþ to his contre
Nouht ffer fro penmarke þar as his dwellinge was
Where as he leues in blisse and in solas
Who couþe tell bot he had wedded bue
The  Ioye þe ese and þe prosperite
  
That is betwyx an husbonde and his wif
A ȝere and more lasted þis blisfull liff
Til þat þis kniht þe whiche I spak of þus
þat of kynred was cleped Arneragus
Schope him to gone and dwelle a ȝere or tweyne
In yngelond þat cleped eke was Bretayne
To seche in armes worschipe and honoure
For al his luste he sette in suche laboure
And dwelleþe þere þe boke seiþe þus
Nowe wil I stint of þis arnaragus
And speken I of Dorigen his wif
þat loueþ hire husbond as hire hertes lif
And for his absence wepeþ sche and sykeþ
As done þis noble wives whan hem likeþ
Sche morneþ wake waileþ fasteþ and pleyneþ
Desire of his presence hir so distreineþ
That al þis wide werld sche sett att nouht
Hire frendes whiche þat knewe hir heue þouht
Comforted hire in al þat euer þei myht or maie
Thei prechen hire þei telen hire nyht and daie
þat causeles sche sleþe hir self alas
And euerI comford possible in þis cas
þei done to hire with al here bisinesse
And al for to make hire lete hire heuynesse
Be proces as ȝe knowe wele euerychone
Men Maie so longe graue in þe stone
Til figure þerinne printed be
So longe haue þei comfort hire þat sche
Receyuede haþe be hope and be resone
þe emprinteinge of hire constillacione
Thoruhe whiche hire grete sorwe gan eswage
Sche maie not alweie endure suche a rage
And eke Arnargus in al þis care
Haþe sent hir lettres home in al þis fare
And þat he wolde come hastely aȝeine  
Or elles hadde þis sorwe hire hert sleyne
  
Hire frendes sauhe hire hert gan to slake
And preide hire on knes for goddes sake
To come and to Rome in companye
Awaie to driue hire derke fantasie
And finally sche graunted þat request
For wele sche sauhe it was for þe best
Now stode hir castel fast by þe see
And often wiþ hire frendes walked sche
Hir to disport on þe se banke on hihe
Where as sche many schippes and barges seihe
Seileinge her course where hem luste to goo
Bot ȝite was þere a percel of hir woo
For to hir selue ful often seide sche
Is þere no schippe of so mony as I see
Wil bringe home my lorde þan wolde myne herte
Al warisshe of þis bitter peine smarte
Anoþere time þere wil sche sitte and þenke
And kast hir eye donward fro þe brenke
Bot whan sche sawhe þe grisely Rokkes blake
For verrei fere so wolde hire heret qwake

þan wolde sche sit adoune vpon þe grene
And pitously into þe see sche walde beholde
And seine riht þus wiþ sorweful hertes colde
Eterne god þat þoruhe þi purueance
Ledest þe werlde be certein gouernance
In ydelnes as men seine ȝe noþinge make
Bot lorde þis griseli fendely Rockes blake
þat semen raþer a foule confusione
Of werke þat any faire creacione
Of whiche a parfit god and a stable
Whi haue ȝe wrouht þis werk vnresonable
For be þis werke souþe norþe este and west

It doþe no good to my witte bot anoyeþ
Sche ȝe nouht lor how mankinde it destrueþ
  
An hundreþ þousand bodyes of mankinde
Haue rokkes sleine and al be þei nouht in mynde
Whiche mankinde is so faire parte of þi werke
þat þou it madest ylike to þine handwerke
Than semed it ȝe hadde a grete chierte  
Toward mankynde bot howe þan maie it be
That ȝe suche menys make it to destroyen
Wyche menys doþ no good but euere annoyen
I woote wele clerkes woln sayn as hem lest
By argumentz þat al þinges is for þe best
They I ne can þe causes for soþe knowe
Bot þilke god þat maade winde to blowe
As kepe my lorde þis conclusion
To clerkis lat I al disputasion
Bot wolde god þat al þe Rokkes blake
Ware sonken into hel for his sake

Thus wold sche seine wiþ mony a pitous tere
Hire frendes sawe þat it nas no disporte
To Roumen be þe see bot discomfort
And schopen for to pleyne sum where elles
Thei leden hire be Reuers and be welles
And eke in oþer place delitables
Thei daunce and plei att chesse and att tables
So on a dai riht on þe morwe tide
Vnto a Gardeine þat was riht þere beside
In whiche þat þei had maade her ordinance
Of vitaile and of oþer purueance
Thei gone and pleine hem al þe longe daie
And þis was on þe sext morwe of maie
Whiche had peintede wiþ his soft schoures
This gardine ful of leues and of floures
And wyþ craft of mannes honde so curiously
Araide had þis gardine trialli
That neuer was þer gardine of suche prise
Bot if it were þe verrei paradise
  
The odur of floures and þe frisshe siht
Wolde han maade ony pensif man liht
That euer was borne bot if to grete sekenesse
Oþer to grete sorwe hilde it in distresse
And after dener gan þei to daunce
So ful it was of beute wiþ plesance
And singen also bot Dorigen songe alone
Sche made alweie here compleinte and hire mone
For sche ne sawhe him on þe daunce goo
þat was hir husbonde and hire loue also
Bot naþeles sche moste hire time abide  
And wiþ goode hope lete sche here sorwe glide
Vpon þis daunce amonges oþere men
Daunced a swyer toforn Dorigen
That frisscher was and Ioliere of araie
As to my dome þan is þe moneþ of maie
He singeþ and daunseþ passinge any oþer man
þat is or was seþþe þis werlde began
þarewiþ he was if men schold him discryue
On of þe beste faringe men on liue
ȝonge stronge riht vertuous ryche and wise
And wele beloued and holden in grete prise
And schortly if þe soþe tellen I schal
Vnweteinge of þis dorigen att all
This lusty swyero seruant to Venus
Whiche þat ycleped was aurelius
Had loued hire best of any creature
Two ȝere and more as was his aduenture
Bot neuer dorst he tellen hire of his greuance
Wiþouten cuppe he drank al his penance
He was dispeired noþinge dorst he saie
Saue in his soule sum what wolde he wraie
His woo as in general compleineinge
He seide he loued and was beloued no þinge
Of suche Matier maade he mony layes
Songes compleintes Roundeletis virrelayes
  
Howe þat he durst nouht his sorwe tell
þat languisseþ as fire doþe in hell
And deye seide he must as dide ekko
For Narsisus þat dorst nouht tell hir wo
In oþere maner þan ȝe here me seie
Ne dorst he nouht to hire his wo bewreie
Saue perauentur sumtime att daunces
There ȝonge folke kepen her obseruaunces
It mai wel be he loked on hir face
In suche a wise as man þat Axeþ grace
Bot no þinge wist sche of his entent
Naþeles it happed er þei þens went
Be cause þat he was hire neiȝbore
And was a mon of worschippe and honoure
And had yknowen him of times ȝore
Thei fel in speche oft more and more
Vnto his purpos drouhe Aurelius  
And whan he sauhe his time he seid þus
Madame quod he be god þat þis werld maade
So þat I miht ȝoure hert glade
I wolde þat daie þat ȝoure Arnaragus
Wente on see þat I Aurelius
Hadde wente þat I scholde neuer haue com aȝeine
For wele I wote my seruise is in veine
Mi guerdon nys bot bristinge of myn herte
Ma dame reweþ vpon my peines smarte
For as wiþ a swerd ȝe maie me sle or saue
Here att ȝoure fote god wolde þat I were graue
I haue as nowe no leiser for to seie
Haue merci on me swete or ȝe wolne do me deye
Sche gan to loke vpon Aurelius
Is þis ȝoure wil quod sche and seie ȝe þus
Neuer eft quod sche wist I what ȝe ment
Bott nowe Aurely I know ȝoure entent
Be þilke god þat ȝaue me soule and lif
Ne schal I neuer be vntrewe wiff
  
In worde ne in werke as fer as I haue witte
I wil be his to whome þat I am knytte
Bot affter þat þou pleine þus seide sche
Tak þis for final ansewer as for me
Aurely quod sche be hihe god aboue
Ȝit wil I graunt ȝoue to be ȝoure loue
Sen þus I ȝowe see so pitously compleigne
Loke what daie þat yngelonde is breteigne
Ȝe remewe al þe rokkes stone be stone

I saie whan ȝe haue maade þis coste so clene
Of Rokkes þat þer nys no stone seene
þan wil I loue ȝowe best of any mān
Haue here my trouþe in al þat euer y can
Is þere none oþer grace quod he
No be þat lorde quod sche þat maade me
For wele I wote þat þat schal neuer betide
Late suche foly oute of ȝoure hert glide
What deynte scholde man haue be his lif
For to loue a noþer mannes wif
þat haþ hir body when so þat him likeþ
Aurelius ful oft sore sikeþ
Woo was Aurely whan þat he þis herde  
And wiþ a sorwful hert þus ansewerde
Madam quod he þis were an inpossible
Than Mot I deie on sodeine deþe Orrible
And wiþ þat worde he torned him anone
Tho cam her oþer frendes mony one
And in þe alies romed vp and doune
And no þinge wist of þis conclusioune
Bot sodenlye began to reuel newe
Til þat þe briht sonn lost his hewe
For þe orizonte haþ raft þe sonne his liht
This is as muche to saie as it was niht
And home þei gone in ioye and in solas
Saue onely wriched Aurelius alas
  
He to his hous is gone wiþ sorweful hert
He seiþe he maie nouht fro his deþ astert
Him semeþ he feleþ his hert colde
Vp to þe heuen his hondes gan he olde
And on his kenes bare he sett him doune
And in his raueinge seide his orisoune
For verrei woo he oute of his witte he braide
He nyst nouht what he spak bot þus he seide
Wiþ pitous hert haþe he his compleinte begunne
Vnto þe goddesse and first vnto þe sonne
He seide Apollo god and gouernoure
And euery planete herbe tre and floure
þat ȝeuest after þine declinacione
To iche of hem his tyme and his sesone
And þin hebour chaungeþ lowe and hihe
Lorde phebus cast þi meciable eyhe
On wriched Aureli whiche þat am forlorne
Lo lorde my lady haþ my deþ sworne
Wiþouten gilte bot þine benygnite
Vppon myne dedly hert haue sum pyte

Now voucheþ saue þat I maie ȝoue deuise
Howe þat I maye be holpe and in what wise

Is to be queked and lihteþ of ȝoure fire
For whiche she folowþ ȝowe ful besily
Riht so þe see desireþ naturelly
To folowen hir as sche þat is goddesse
Boþ in þe see and in reuers more and lesse
Wherfor lord Phebus þis is myn request
Do þis miracle or I do myne hert to brest

Whiche in signe schal be of þe lyōn
Haþe praide hire so grete a flode to bringe

The hiest rokke in Armorik bretaine
And lat his flode endure ȝeres tueyne
Than certes to my lady may I seie
Holdeþ þoure heste þe rokkes bene awaie
Lorde phebus do þis Miracle for me
Preie hire sche go no faster cours þan ȝe
I seie ȝoue þus prei ȝoure suster þat sche go
None fastere cours þan ȝe þis ȝeres tuo

And springe lasten boþ nyht and daie
And bot sche vowchesaue in suche manere
To graunt me my lady souereigne dere
Praie hir to sinken euery rok adoune
Into hir owen derke regione
Vnder þe grounde þer pluto duelleþ inne
Oþer neuer more schal I my lady wynne
Thine temple in delphos wil I barfote seek
Lorde Phebus seþe ȝe þe teres on my cheke
And of my pyne haue compassione
And wiþ þat worde in swoune he fel adoune
And longe time he laie in traunce
His broþer whiche þat knewe of his penaunce
Vp cauht him and to bed him brouht
Despeired in his torment and in his þouht
Lo I þis woful creature lye
Chese he for me weþer he wil leue or deye
 Arueragus wiþ hele and grete honoure
As he was of þe chiualrie þe floure
Is commen home and oþer worþi men
O blisfulful ert þou doregen
That haste þin lusti husbande in þine Armes  
þe frische knyht þe worþi man of armes
  
þat loueþ þe as his owen hertes lif
No þinge lust him to be ymaginatif
Of any wight had spoke whiles was oute
To hire of loue he maade þereof no doute
He nouhte entendeþ to none suche matiere
Bot daunceþ Iustiþ and makeþ good chere
As þus in ioy and blisse I late hem dwelle
And of þe swete aurelius wil I tell
In langure and in furious tormentes þus
Two ȝere and more laie wreched Aurelius
Or ony foote on erþe he myht gone
Ne comfort in þis time had he none
Saue of his broþer whiche þat was a clerke
He knewe of al þis woo and of al þis werke
For to none oþer creature certeine
Of þis matier ne dorst he no worde seine
Vnder his brest he bare his more secre
Than euer dide Pamphilius for Galathe
His brest was hole wiþowten for to sene
Bot in his herte was aie þe arwe kene
And wele ȝe wote þat a sore savoure
In surgere ful perilous is þe cure
Bot man myht touche þe arwe or come þerby
His broþer wepeþ and weileþ priuely
Til att þe last him fel in remembrance
þat whiles he was att Orliaunce in fraunce
As ȝonge clerkes þat buen licorous
To reden artes þat buen curious
Seken in euery halke and in euery herne
Particulere sciens for to lerne
He him remembreþ vpon a daie
Att Orliance in stode a boke he saye
Of Magik naturelle whiche is felawe
þat was þat time a bacheller of lawe
Al were he þere to lerne anoþer crafte
An priuely vpan his deske he lafte
  
þis boke whiche spak muche of þis operacions
Toucheinge þe xxviiij Mancions
That longeþ to þe mone and suche folye
As in oure daies ne is not worþe a flye
For holy cherche seiþe in owre beleue  
Ne suffureþ none illusione vs to greue
And whan þis booke was in remembraunce
Anone for ioye he gan to daunce
And to him self seide priuely
Mi broþer schal be warisched hastely
For I am seker þat þere be sciencis
Be whiche men make diuers apparences
Whiche as þe subtile tregitours pleine
For oft att festes herd I seine
þat tregetours wiþ in an hal large
Haue maad in come water and a barge
And in þe hall rowe vp and doune
Som time haþe semed a grime lyoune

Sum tyme wyne and grapis white and rede  
Som tim a castel al of lyme and stone
And whan him liked voide it anone
Thus semed it to euery mannes siht
Nowe þan conclude I þus if þat I myht
At orlyance some olde felawe finde
þat had þe mones mancions in mynde
Oyþer magik naturel aboue
He scholde wele mak my broþer haue his loue
For wiþ apparens a man maie make
To mannenes siht þat al þe rokkes blake
Of Beteigne were went euerychone
And þat schippes be þe brinke myht comen and gone
And in suche forme endure a ȝere or tuo
Then were my broþer waresched of his wo
Then most sche nedes knowe hire behest
Or elles he schamen hire schal att þe leste
  
What scholde make a longer tale of þis
Vnto his broþer bedde commen he is
And suche comfor he ȝaf him for to gone
To Orliaunce þat vp sterte anone
And on his waie forwarde is he fare
In hope to be lessed of his care
Whan þeie were come almoste to þat Citee
Bot if were a tuo furlonge or þree
A ȝonge clerke romeynge by himselfe þei · mette
Whiche þat in latine þrefteli hem grette
And after þat seide he a wonder þinge
I knowe quod he þe cause of ȝoure comynge
An er þei forþer any foote wente
He tolde hem al þat was in her entent
This briton clerke him asked of felawes
The whiche þat he had knowen in olde dawes
And he anseward him þat þei dede were
For whiche he wepped ful oft mony a tere
Downe of his hors Aurelius liht anone
And furþe wiþ þis Magicien is he gone
Home to his howse and maade hem wele att ese
Hem lakked no vitaile þat hem myht plese
So wele araide hous as þer was one
Aurelius in his lif ne sawe he none
He schewde him ar he went to soper
Forest Parkes ful of wilde dere

The grettest that euer were se with ye 
He  say of hem An hunderid slayn with houndes
And some with Arowes bled and bitter woundes
He say whan voydid were thes wylde der
þe fauconers vp on A faire rever  
And how fakons haue þe heron sleine
Than sawe he knyhtes Iusten in a pleine
And after þis he dide him suche plesance
That he him schewde his lady in a daunce
  
On whiche him self he daunced as him þouht
And whan þis maister þat þis magik wrouht
Sawe it was time he clapped his hondes two
And fare wele al oure reuel is do
And ȝitte remewe þei neuere oute of þis house
Whiles þei sawe al þis siht meruelouse
Bot in his stodye þere as his bokes be
The satten stil and no whight bot þei þre
To him þis maister called þan a swyere
And seide him þus is redi oure sopere
Al most an houre it is I vndertake
Seþens I ȝowe badde oure soper to make
When þat þis worþi men wenten wiþ me
Vnto my stode þer as my bokes be
Sire quod þis Swye whan it lykeþ ȝoue
It is al rede þouhe ȝe wolde riht nowe
Go we þan to soupe quod he and for þe best
þes auerous folke sum time mot haue rest
And after soper fel þei in trete
What somme schold þis maister guerdone be
To remoue al þe rokkes of bretaigne
And eke fro geroun to þe mouþe of seine
He maade it straunge and swore so god him saue
Lesse þan a þousand pounde he nolde not haue
Ne gladly for þe somme ne wolde he gone  
Aurelius wiþ blisful herte anone
Onsewarde þus fy on a þousand pounde
This wide werlde þat men seine is rounde
That wold I ȝeue if I were lorde of it
This Bargeyne is ful dreue for we bue knyt
Ȝe schollene be paide treuly be my trouþe
Bot lokeþ nowe for no necligens or sleuþe
Ȝe tary vs here no longer þan to morwe
Nay quod þis clerke haue here my trouþe to borwe
To bed is gone Aurelius whan him luste
And wel nyhe al þat nyht he had his ruste
  
That for his laboure and for his hope of blisse
His woful herte of penance hadde a lisse
Vpon þis mowe whan þat it was daie
To bretaine toke þei þe riht weie
Aurelius and þis magicien be side
And buene descendit þere þei wilne abide
And þis was as þe bokes me remembre
The colde frosty seson of decembre
Phebus waxede olde and hewed ylike latoun

Schone as þe burnyd gold wiþ stremes briht
Bot nowe in scorpion adoune he liht
Where as he schone ful pale I dare wel seien
The bitter frostes wiþ slete and reine
Destruyed haþ ȝe grene in euery ȝerde
Ianus sit be fire wiþ double berde
And drinkeþ of his bugle horne þe wyne
Beforne him stant þe braune of þe twext swyne
And a nouel crieþ euery lusti man
Aurelius in al þat euere he can
Doþe his maister chier and reuerence
And preyeþ him to done his diligence
To bringen him oute of his peines smerte
Oþer wiþ a swerde þat he wold slitt his herte
That subtille clerk whiche þat reuþe hadde on þis man
þat nyht and daie he him spedde þat he ne lan
To waite a time of his conclusione

I ne can no termes of astrologie
Be whiche an apparens of Iogellery
That sche and euery wight schold wene and seie  
þat of Bretaigne þe rokkes were aweie
Or elles þei were sonken vnder grounde
So att þe last whan that he his time founde
To make his Iapes and his wrechednesse
Of whiche a supersticious cursedenesse
  
His tables colletanes forþ he brouht
Ful wele corrected for þere lakked nouht
Ne his collectes ne his expans ȝeres
Ne his rotes ne his oþere geres
As biene is centres and his argumentez
And his proporcione conuenientez
For his equacions in euery þinge
And be his viij spere in his wirkinge
He knewe howe fere alnaþe was yschoue
From þe heued of þilke fix aries aboue

Ful subtilli he calleþ al þis
And whan he had fonde his first mancion
He knewe þe remenant be proporcion
And knewe þe ariseinge of þe mone wele
And in whos face and terme euery dele
And knewe ful wele þe mones mansion
Accordant to his operacion
And kewe al so his oþer obseruauncez
For suche illusions and suche meschaunces
As eyþen folke vside þilke daies
For whiche no longer Maked he delaies
Bott þoruhe his magik for a weke or tweie
It semede þat al þe rokkes were a waie
Aurelius whiche þat despayred is
Weþer he schal haue his or fare amys
Awaiteþ nyht and daie of þis miracle
And whan he knewe þer was none obstacle
þat voided were þes rokkes euerychon
Doune to his maistres fete he fel a none
And seide I wooful wriche Aurelius
Thank ȝowe lord and lady myne Venus
That me haue holpe fro my Cares colde
And to þe temple forþe his weie haþe holde
Where ke knewe he scholde his lady se
And whan he sawhe his time anone riht he

Saluyd haþ his souereigne lady dere

Or ȝe me sleyne because þat I ȝowe loue
For madame wele ȝe wote þat ȝe haue hiht

Alas quod sche þat euer þis scholde happe
For wend I neuer be possibelite

Bot naþeles ȝit hadde leuere to lese
Mi lif þan of my bodi to haue a schame
Oþer knowe my self fals oþer lese my name
And wiþ my deþ I may me quyte ywis
Haþ þere nouht mony a wif ar þis
And mony a maiden ysleine hire self alas
Raþer þat wiþ hire bodis done trespas
And certes lo þes stories bereþ wittenesse
Whan xxx tyrantez ful of cursednesse
Had sleyne Phidon in Athenes att þe lest
Thei commaunded his douhtres to arest
And bringen hem beforne him in despite
Al naked to fulfil hire foule delite
And in here faders blode þe made hem daunce
Vppon þe pament god ȝeue hem meschaunce
For whiche þes woful maidens ful of drede
Raþer þan þe wolden lese here maidenhede
þei priuely bene stert into a well
And dreinte hem self as þe bokes tell
Thei of Mesne lete equere and seke
Of lacedemye l maydens eke
  
On whiche þei wolden done here licherye
Bot was þere none of al þat companye
þat sche nas sleyne wiþ a gladd entent
And raþer chase to deye þan for to assent
To bien oppressed of here maidenhede
Whi schold I þan to deye buen in drede
 Lo eke þe tyrant Anstoclides

Whan þat hir fader sleine was on a nyht
Vnto Dyanes temple goþe sche anone riht
And hent þe ymage wiþ hire armes tuo
Fro whiche ymage wold sche neuer goo
No wyht myȝt of it hire hande race  
Til sche was sleine in þe selue place
Nowe seþen þat maidens hadd suche despite
To bien defouled wiþ mannes foule delite
Wele auht a wif raþer her self sle

That schal I seien of Asdrubardis wiff

For whan sche sawe þa romeine wanne þe toune
Sche toke hir children al and swep adoune
In to þe fire and chase raþer to deye
þan any Romeyne did hire velanye
Haþ nouht Lucres sleyne hire self alas
Att Rome þare sche oppressed was
Of Tarquyne for hire þouht it was a schame
To leue whan þat sche had lost hire name
The viij Maidens of Milesye also
Haue sleyne hem self for drede and woo
Raþer þan folke of Gaule schold hem oppresse
Mo þan a þousand storis as I gesse
Couþe I nowe tell as toucheinge þis matier
Whan Abradas was sleyne his wif so dere
Hire selfe slowhe and lete hire blode to glide
In Abradas woundes brode and wide
  
And seide my body att þe leste waye
þar schal no whight defoule it if þat I maie
What schold I mo ensamples here of sayne
Seþen þat so many haue hem selfe slayne
Wele raþer þan þei wolde defouled be
I wil conclude what is best for me

I wol be trewe vnto Arueragus  
Oþir rather sle my self in sum manere
As did Demonycious douhter dere
Because þat sche nold nouht defouled be
O cedasus it is ful grete pite
To reden howe þin douhtern deyden alas
þat slowhe hem self for suche a maner cas
As grete pite was it· or more
Theban Maiden þat fo Nichasor

An othir theban mayde dede right so  
Hire had wedded and dressed
For one of Macedoyne had hire oppressed
What scha I seie of Nichostratifs wif
þat for suche caas beraft hire self hir lif
Howe trew was eke to Alcebiades  
His loue þat fo to deyen chese
Then for to suffren his body vmbreide be
Lo whiche a wif was Alcestem quod sche
What Emore of good Penolope
Al grece knoweþ of her chastitee
Parde of Leodomya is wreten þus
Thate whan att troye was slayne protheselayus
No longer wolde sche leue after his daye

To whome he had al hole hir herte yȝeue
The parfyte wyfhode of Arthemesye

O Teuta queene in þine wifly chastite

Thus pleyned dorigen a day or tueye
Purposed euere þat sche wolde deye

Home cam Arueragus þe worþi knyht
And axed hire whi þat sche wepped so sore
And sche gan wepen euere þe longere more
Alas quod sche þat euer was I borne
Thus haue I seide quod sche þus haue I sworne
I tolde him al as ȝe haue herde before
It nedeþ nouht to rehersen it no more
This husbonde wiþ glad chere in sondre wise
Anseward and seide as I schal ȝowe deuyse
Es þer ouht elles dorigen bot þis
Nay naye quod sche god helpe me so as wis
This is to meche· and it were goddes will

It maie be wele ȝit perauentur to seie
Sche schol ȝoure trouþe holden be my faie
For god so wisly helpe me

For verrei loue whiche þat I to ȝoue haue
Bot if ȝe scholde ȝoure trouþe saue
Trouþe is þe hiest þinge þat man maie kepe
Bot wiþ þat worde he brast anone to wepe
And seide I ȝoue forbede vpon peyne of deþe

Til no wihte telle howe þat þis matier  
As I maye kepe I wil me wo endure
Ne make no countenance of heuynesse

And forþe he cleped a swyer and a maide
Goþe forþe anone wiþ Dorogen he saide
  
And bringeþe hir to suche a place anone

This Swyere whiche þat hiht Aurelius
On dorigen whiche þat was so amerous
Of aduenture happed hire to mete
Amydde þe toune riht in þe quek strete
As sche was boune to gone þe waie forþ riht
Towarde þere as sche had hiht
And he was to þe Gardeine ward also
For wele he spiede whan sche wold go
Owte of hire hous to any maner place
Bot þus þei mette of aduenture or of grace
And he saluyd hire wiþ glad entente
And axed of hire wheder þat sche wente
And sche ansewarde half as sche was madde

My trouþe for to holde alas alas
Aurelius gan wonder of þis caas
And in his hert had grete compassione
Of hire and of hire lamentacione
And of Arnaragus þe worþi knyht
þat bad hire holde al þat sche hiht
So loþe he was his wif schold breke hir trouþe
And in his herte he kest of þis grete rouþe
Consideringe þe beste on euery side
þat fro his luste were him better abide
þan done so hihe a cherles wrechednesse
Aȝeines ffraunchis and aȝeynes al gentillesse
  
For whiche in fewe wordes seide he þus
Madame seiþe to ȝoure lorde Arneragus

To ȝowe and eke I see wele ȝoure destresse
þan ȝe to me þus scholde breke ȝoure trouþe
Sertes me þinkeþ it were riht grete rouþe
I haue wele leuer euer to suffre woo  
Then I departe þe loue betuex ȝow tuoo
I ȝowe reles ma dame in to ȝoure honde
Quyte euery surement and euery bonde

Seþyns þilke time þat ȝe were borne
My trouþe I plihte I schal ȝowe neuer repreue
Of no byheste and here I take my leue
As of þe trewest and þe best wif
þat euere ȝit knewe I in al my lyf
Bot euer y wyht bewar of hire behest
On dorigen remembreþ att þe lest
þus can a swyer done a gentil dede
As wele as kan a knyht wiþ outen drede
Sche þonke him vppon hire knees al bare
And home vnto hire housebonde is sche fare
And told him all ȝe haue herde me seide
And be ȝe seker he was so wele apaide
þat it were impossible to write
What schold I longer of þis cas endite
Arueragus and Dorigene his wif
In seuereigne blisse leden forþe here lyfe
Neuer eft ne was þere anger hem betwene
He chiriseþ hire as þouhe sche where a quene
And sche was to him treue for euer more
Aurelius þat his cost haþe Al forlore
Curseþ þe time þat euer he was borne
For certes he seiþ I am forlorne
Alas quod he alas þat I behiht
O pured gold a þousand poude of wyht
  
Vnto þis Philofre howe schal I do
I se no more bot þat I am fordo
Myne heritage most I nedes sell
And buen a begger here may I no longer dwell
And schamen al þis kinrede in þis place
Bot I of him maie gette þe better grace

At Certeyne yeeris and dayes to pay  
I wil þonke him of his grete curtesie
Myne trouþe wil I kepe I wil nouht lye
Wiþ hert sore he goþe vnto his cofre
And brouht golde vnto his philosofre
The valewe of vjC pounde I gesse
And him besecheþ of his gentillesse
To graunt him daies of þe remenant  
And maistere I dare wele make auaunt
I failed neuer my trouþe as ȝite
For sekurly my dettes schal I quyte
Towarde ȝowe howe euer þat I fare
To gone abigged in my kirtel bare
Bot wold ȝe vouche sauf vpon suyrte
Two ȝere oþer þre te respite me
Then ware I wele for elles most I sell
Myne heritage þer nys no more to tell
Thi philosophre soburly ansewerd
And seid þus whan he þes wordes herde
Haue I nouht holden couenant vnto þe
ȝis certes wele and treuly quod he
Hast þou not had þi lady as þe lykeþ
No no quod he and sorwfully he sikeþ
Whatt was þe cause tel me if þou can
Aurelius his tale anone began
And tolde him al as ȝe han herde before
It nedeþ nouht to rehersen no more

Had leuyr dye in sorow and distresse
  
Than his wif were of hir trouthe fals
The sorow of Dorigen he tolde hym als
How loth hir was to ben a wickid wif
And that sche leuyr had that day lost hir lif
And that hir trouthe sche swore thorogh ynnocence
Sche neuyr erst herd speke of apparence
And riht as frely as he sent hire to me

As frely sent I hire to hime aȝeine
This is al and somme þere nys no more to seine

Nowe telleþ me or þat I forþe wende

THe Ministre of þe Norice vnto vices

 For he þat wiþ his þousand cordes slyȝe

Til þat a man be hente riht be þe lappe

Of þere comeþ neuere none encrese
And seþens þat slouþe hir haldeþ in a lese
Onely to slepe and for to ete and drinke
And to deuowren al þat oþer swynke
  
 And for to putt vs fro suche Idelnesse

After þe legent in translacione
Riht of þe glorious lif and passione

In whome þat god for bounte chees to wonne

Nouht only helpest hem þat preyen þe
But oft time of þi benignite

Of erthely lust and fals effeccion

 Ȝet praie I ȝowe þat reden þat I write
Forȝeueþ me þat I do no diligence

For boþe haue I þe wordes and þe sentence
Of hem þat att þe seintes reuerence

And praien ȝowe þat ȝe woll my werk amende
 ffirste will I ȝowe þe name of sein Cecile
Expounde as men maie in here stories see  
It is to seyen on Englisshe heuenes lylye
For pure chastenesse of virginitee
Oþer for sche witnesse hadde of honeste
Of grene of conscience and of good fame
The swete sauoure lylye was hir name
Oþere Cecely is to seie þe waie to blinde
For sche ensample was be gode techeinge
Or elles Cicily is as I writen fynde
Is Ioyned be a maner conioyneinge
Of heuen and lya and hire in fygureinge
þe heuen is sette for þouht of holynesse
And lya for hire lasteinge besinesse
Cecile eke mai be seide in þis manere
Wanteynge of blindenesse for hire grete liht
Of Sapiens and for hire þewes clere
Or elles lo þis maydens name briht

Men myht þe heuen of þe peple hir call
Ensample of goode and wise werkes all
  
For leos peple in ynglissle is to seie
And riht as men may in þis heuen see
The sonne and mone and þe sterres euery weye
Riht so gostly in þis mayden fre
Seyen þe faiþe of Manificence
And eke of helþe and of sapiens
And sondre werkes briht of excellence
An riht as þes philosofers write
þat heuen is swift rounde and berneinge
Riht so was faire Cecile þe white
Ful sweft and besi euer in good workinge
And rounde and hole in goode perseueringe
And bernede euer in charite liht
Nowe haue I declared ȝow what sche hiht
This maiden hiht Cecile as hire lif seiþe
Was comen of Romeyns and of noble kinde
And so forþe fostred vp in þe feiþe
Of Crist and bare his gospell in hir mynde
Sche neuer cesede as I wreten finde
Of hire praier and god to loue and drede
Besecheinge him to kepe hire Maidenhede
And whan þis maiden scholde vnto a man
Iwedded be þat was ful ȝonge of Age  
Whiche þat ycleped was Waleriane
And þe daie was commen of his Mariage
Sche fel deuoute and homble in hire Corage
Vnder hire robe of golde þat satte ful faire
And next hire flesche yclad hire in an haire
  
 And while þe orgens maden melodie
To god alone þus in hert songe sche
O lorde my soule and eke my bode gie
Vnwemed lest þat I confounded be
And for his loue þat deied vpon a tree
Euery secunde or þe þred daie sche fast
Aie biddige in hir orisons ful fast
 The nyht came and to bed sche most gone
Wiþ hire husbond as often is þe manere
And priuely sche seide anone
O swete and wel beloued spouse dere
þer is a counsel and ȝe wold it here
Whiche þat riht feine I wil vnto seine
So þat ȝe me assured it nouȝt to bewreine
 Valerian gan fast vn to hir swere
þat for no caas ne þinge þat miht be
He scholde for noþinge neuere bewrien hire
And þann att erst vnto him þus seid sche
I haue an Angel whiche þat loueþ me
þat wiþ grete loue wheþer so y wake or slepe
Is rede ay my bode for to kepe
 And ȝif þat he may felen oute of drede

He ryȝt anon wol slee you with þe dede
And in your thought þus schulle ye dye
And yf ye me in clennes gy  
He wolde ȝowe loue as me for ȝoure clennesse
And schewen ȝowe of his ioye and his brihtnesse
  
 Valerian correctid as god wolde
Ansewerd aȝeine if I schal truste to þe
Latt me þat Angel see and him beholde
And if þat it a verraie Angel be
þan wil I done as þou hast preide me
And if þou loue a noþere man for soþe
Riht wiþ þis swerde I wil sle ȝowe boþe
 Cecile ansewerd anone in þis wis
If þat ȝowe lust þat Angel schal ȝe see
So þat ȝe trowe on criste and ȝowe baptize
Goþe forþe to via apia quod sche
That frome þis toune ne stant bot miles þree
And to þe pouer folkes þat þere duelle  
Sei hem riht þus as þat I schal ȝowe telle
 Tel hem þat I Cecile ȝowe to hem sent
To schewen ȝowe þe good vrbane þe oolde
For secre nedes and for good entent
And whan þat ȝe seint vrban haue beholde
Tel him þe wordes whiche þat I ȝowe tolde
And whan þat he haþ purged ȝowe fro sinne
Than schal ȝe se þat angel ar ȝe twinne

And riht as him was tauht be his lerenynge

Amonge þe seintes buriels lotiynge
And he anone wiþouten tariynge

 For þilke spouse þat sche toke bot nowe
Ful like a fers lyon sche sendeþ here

And wiþ þat worde anone þer gan apere
And old man clad wiþ white cloþes clere
And had a booke wiþ lettres of gold in honde
And gan beforne Valerian stonde

When he him saughe and him vp hent þoo
And on his booke riht þus he gan to rede

And wiþ þat worde Tiburce his broþer come

Al þis þinge sche vnto tyburce tolde
 And affter þis tiburce in good entent
To pope vrban wiþ valerian he went
Whiche þonked god and wiþ glad hert and liht
He Cristened him and maade him in þat place
Parfite in his leueynge goddes knyht
And aftur þis Tiburce gat suche grace
That euery daie he sawe in time and space  
The aungel of god and euery maner bone

 It were ful harde be order for to seyne
Howe mony wonderes ihesu for him wrouht
Bot att þe last to tel schort and pleine
The seriant of þe toune of Rome hem souht
And hem beforne Almache þe prouost brouht
Whiche hem opposed and knewe all her entente
And to þe ymage of Iubiter he hem sente
 And seid who so wil nouȝt sacrifice
Swappe of his hede þis is my sentence here
Anone þes marters þat I ȝowe of deuise
On Maximius þat was an officere
Of þe profectes and of Corniculere
Hem hent and when he forþe þe seintes ladde
Him selfe he wope for pite þat he hadde
 And whan maximius hadd herd þe seintes lore
He gatte hem of þe tormentours leue
And hadde hem in his house wiþ oute more
And wiþ here precheinge ar þat it were eue
þei gōn fro þe tormentours to reue
And frome maximius and frome his folke ichone

 Cecele Came whan it was waxen nyht
Wiþ prestes þat hem crėstened al in fere
And afterward whan daie was waxen liht
Cecile hem seide wiþ a sobre chere
Nowe cristes owen knyhtes leue and dere
Cast al awaye þe werkes of derknesse
And armeþ ȝowe in armure of lyhtnesse
  
 Ȝe haue for sothe done grete Bataile
And haþe þe victorie ȝoure feiþe ȝe haue confermed
Go to þe croune of lif þat maie nouht faile
Þe rihtful Iugge whiche þat ȝe haue serued
Will bringe ȝowe to his blisse þat to ȝow haþ reserued
And whan þis þinge was seide as I devise
Men led hem forþe to done þe sacrifise
 Bot whan þei were vnto þe place ybrouht
To tell schortly þe conclusioune
Thei nolde encense no sacrifise riht nouht
Bot on her knees þei satten hem a doune
Wiþ humble hert and sadde deuocion  
And losten boþe her hedes in þe place
Here soules went to þe kenge of grace
 This Maxinius þat sawe þis þinge betide
Wiþ pitous tales tolde it anone riht
Þat he her soules sawhe to heuen glide
Wiþ algels ful of clerenesse and of liht
And wiþ his worde conuerted mony a wyht
For whiche almachius dide him so tobete
Wiþ whippe of leede to he his lif gan lete
Cecilie him toke and beried him anone
Be tiburce and valeriane softly
Wiþ inne hire heriynge place vnder a stone
And after þis Almachius hastely
Badde his Ministres ffecchen openly
Cecile so sche myht in his presence
Do sacrifice and Iubite encense
  
 Bot þei conuerted þorwhe here wise lore
Wepten sore and ȝaf credence
Vnto her worde and cryden more and more
Crist god son with outen difference
Is verrey god þis is al oure sentence

Bad fecche Cecile þat he miht hir see
And alþer ferst lo þis was his askeinge
What maner womman ert þou þo quod he
I am gentill womman borne quod sche

Of þi religion and of þi beleue
Whi þan began ȝoure questione folilye

Of whense quod sche when þat sche was refreynede
Of concience and of good feiþe vnfeynede

Of þin Ansewere and sche him ansewerd þus

For euery motel manesse power ne is

And gone al quyte if he wil it renaye
 Ȝoure Princes erren as ȝoure noblen doþe
Quod þo Cecile and a woode sentence

Fore þat knowen wele oure Innocence
For as muche as we done a reuerence
To criste and for we bere a cristen name

 Bot we þat knowen þelk name so
For vertuous we maie it nouȝt seie
Almachie seide chese one of þes tuo

Lo he dissimuleþ here in audience

To whome Almachius seide o vncely wrecche

 Haþe nouht oure myhte prince to me yȝouen

 And ȝif þou drede nouht a soþe to here

Thou na haste þerto neiþer pouer ne leue

Do waie þi boldenes seide Almachius þo
Or sacrifice to oure goddes or tuo
I reche nouht what wronge þat þou me profer
For I can suffre it as a philosofer
Bot þilke wronges maie I not endure

And þat þou were in euery maner wise
A lewde Officer and a veine Iustise
  
þere lakkeþ no þinge to þine vtter yȝen

And tast it wele a stone þou schalt it finde
Sens þat þou sixt it not wiþ þine yȝen blinde
It is a schame þat þe peple schal
Schal scoren þe and lauhe att þi folye
For communly wemmen wote it wele ouere al

And þes ymages wele þan maistowe aspie
To þe ne to hem self ne maie þei profit
For in hire effecte þei bue nouht worþe a myte

And he wex wroþe and badde sche scholde be ledde
Home to hire hous and in hir hous quod he

And as he bad riht so was done þe dede
And in a bathe þei gan hir fast schetten
And nyht and daie grete fire vnder þei maden
Al þe longe niht and þe daie also
For al þe fire and eke þe baþes hete

Ne maade hire nouȝt a drope for to swete
Bot in þat baþe hir lif sche moste lete
For he Almachius wiþ ful wekked entent  
To sleene hir in þe baþe his sonde sent
  
þree strokes in þe nekke he smote hir þo
The tormentour bot for no maner chaunce
He myhte nouhte smyte al here nek y tuo
And for þere was þat time an ordinance
That no man schold do to man suche penance
The ferþe stroke to smyten soft or sore

Bot half dede wiþ hire nek ycoruen þere
He left hire lye and in his weie he wente
The cristen folke whiche abowten hire were
Wiþ schetes home ful feire here hente
þree daies leued sche in þis torment
And neuer cesed hem þe feiþe to teche

And hem sche ȝaue here mebles and her þinge
And to þe Pope vrban betoke hem þo
And seide þus axed þis of heuen kinge
To haue respite þrei daies and no mo
To recommande to ȝowe er þat I go

In þe whiche in to þis daie in noble wise
Men done to criste and to his seintes seruise
Whan ended was þe lif of seint Cecile
Er we had reden fulli fiue myle
Att bouhton vnder þe ble vs gan a take
A man þat cloþed was in cloþes blake
And vnder þat he hadde a white surplis
His Hakenay þat was al pomel gris
So swete þat it wonder was to see
It semed he had priked myles þre
þe hors eke þat ȝoman rode vpone
So swet þat vnneþ myht he gone
Aboue þe paitrel stode þe fome ful hyȝe
He was of fome al flekked as a pye  
A male tweyfold on his cropur leye
It semed þat he Caride litel araye
Al liht for somere rode þis worþe man
And in myn herte wonder I began
What þat he was til þat I vnderstode
Howe þat his cloke was sewed to his hode
For whiche when I longe had auysed me
I demed him sum chanon for to be
His hatte honge doune behinde his be a lace
For he had ridde more þan a trote or a pace
It hadde ay priked lyke as he ware wode
A clote lef he had vnder his hode
For suote and for to kepe his hed from hete
Bot it was Ioy for to seen him swete
His fored dropped as a stillatorie
Where ful of pleintein and of peritorie
  
And whan he come he gan to crye
God saue quod he þis Iolie companye
Fast haue I priked quod he for ȝoure sake
Because þat I wold ȝowe ouer take
To riden in þis mery companye
His ȝoman eke was ful of curtasie
And sires nowe in morwe tide
Oute of ȝoure Ostlery I sawe ȝowe ride
And warned here my lorde and my souereine
Whiche þat to ride wiþe ȝowe is ful feyne
For his disporde he loueþ daliance
Frende for þi warneyinge god ȝeue þe good chaunce
Seide oure oste sertes it wolde seme
Thi lorde were wise and so I maie wele deme
He is ful Iocunde also dar I laie
Can he ouht tell a mery tale or tueye
Wiþ whiche he glade maie þis companye
Who sire my lord ȝe ȝe wiþ oute lye
He kan of merþe and eke of Iolyte
Not bot Inowhe also  tresteþ me
And ȝe him knewe as wel as do I
ȝe wold wonder howe wele and þreftely
He couþe werke and þat in sundre wise
He haþ tak on him mony sundre aprise
Whiche were ful harde for any þat is here
To bringe aboute bot þei of him it lere  
As homely as he rideþ amonges ȝowe
If ȝe him knewe it wolde be ȝoure prowe
ȝe nolde nouht forgone his aqueyntance
For mochel good I dare leie in a balance
Al þat I haue in myne proossione
He is a man of hihe discrecione
I warne ȝowe wele he is a passinge man
Wele quod oure oste I pray þe tel me þan
Is he clerk or none tel what he is
Nay he is gretter þan a clerke ywis
  
Seide ȝoman and in wordes fewe

I sei my lorde can suche a sutelte
Bot al his craft ȝe maie nouht wite att me
And som what help I ȝit to his worcheinge

Til þat we come to Canturbury toune
He couþe al clene torne vp so doune
And paue it al of siluer and of golde
And whan þis ȝoman hadde þus ytolde
Vnto oure hoste he seide benedicite
þis þinge is wonder meruelous to me
Seþens þat þi lorde of so hihe prudence
Be cause of whiche men scholde hem reuerence
þat of his worschipe recheþ he so lite
His ouere slope is not worþe a myte
As in effecte to him so mot I go
It is al bawde and totore also
Whi is þi lorde so slottesche I þe preie
And his of pouer better cloþes to beie
If þat his dede accorde wiþ þi speche
Tel me þat and þat I þe beseche
Whie quod þis ȝoman wherto ax ȝe me
God helpe me so for he schal neuer þe

And þere for kepe it secre I ȝowe preie
He is to wise in feiþe as I beleue
þat þat is ouere done it wil nouht preue
And riht as clerkes seine it is a vice
Wherefore in þat I holde him lewde and nyce
For whan a man haþ ouere grete a witte
Ful oft it hapneþ to mis vsen it  
So doþe my lorde and þat me greueþ sore
God it amend I can seie nowe no more
Thareof no force good ȝoman quod oure Oste
Seþens his connynge of þi lorde þou woste
  
Tel howe he doþe I praie þe hertelye
Seþen þat he is so craftie and so slye
Where dwellen ȝe it to tel be
In þe subbarbes of a toune quod he

Where þes robbers and þeues be kinde
Holden her priue fereful residence
As þei þat dare nouht schewe her presence
So fare we if I schal sey þe soþe
ȝit quod oure Oste lat me talke to þe
Whie ert þou discoloure in þi face
Peter quod he god ȝif harde grace
I am so vsed in þe fire to blow
That it haþe chaunged my colour as I trowe
I am nouht wont in no myrrour to prie
Bot swynke sore and leren to multiplie
We blondern euer and pouren in þe fire
And for al þat we failen of oure desire
For euere we lakken oure conclusione
To muche folke we bene bot illusione
And borwe golde be it a pounde or tuo
Or ten or xij or mony summes mo
And make hem wene att þe leste weie

ȝit is it fals and aye we haue good hope
It forto done and after it we grope
Bot þat science is so fer vs beforne
We mowe nouhte alþouhe we had it suorne
It ouertake it slide awaie so faste
It wil vs make beggers att þe last
Whiles þis ȝoman was þus in þis talkeinge
This Chanon drouhe him nere and herd al þinge
Whiche þat þis ȝoman spak for suspecione
Of men speche euer had þis chanone
For Caton seiþe he þat giltif is
Demeþ al þinge be spoke of him ywys
  
Because of þat he gan so nyhe to drawe
His ȝoman þat he herd al his sawe  
And þus he seide vnto his ȝoman þo
Holde þow þi pees and speke wordes no mo
For if þou do þou schalt it dere abye
Tho sklanderst me here in þis compaignye
And eke diskeuerest þat þou scholdest hide

Of al þis þreteinge reche þe nouht a myte
In feiþe quod he no more I do bot a lite
And whan þis Chanone sawe it wolde nouht be
Bot his ȝoman wolde tel his priuete
He fledde awaie for verrei sorwe and schame
A quod þis ȝoman here schal arise game
Al þat I can anone wil I tell
Seþen he is gone þe foule fende him quell
For neuer here after wil I wiþ him mete
For penye ne for pounde I behete
He þat me brouht first vnto þat game
Er þat he deie sorwe haue he and schame
For it ernest to me be my feiþe
þat fele I wele what so any man seiþe
And ȝitte for al my smert and al my greue
For al my sorwe laboure and mescheue
I couþe neuere leue it in no wise
No wolde god my witte myht suffise
To tellen al þat longeþ for þat arte
Bot naþeles ȝit wil I tel ȝowe parte
Seþen my lorde is gone I wil not spare
Suche þinge as I knowe I wil declare
Wythe þis chanon dwelled haue I seuen ȝere
And of his science am I neuer þe nere
Al þat I had I haue Ilost þere by
And god wote so haþe mony mo þan I
Ther I was wont to be riht frissche and gay
Of cloþinge and of good arraie
Nowe may I were an hose vpon myn hede
And where my coloure was boþe freche and rede
Now it is wan and of a lewde hewe
Who so it vseþ sore scall he rewe
And of my swynke ȝit blered is myne eyȝe
Lo whiche avantage is for to multepliȝe
þat slideinge science haþ me maade so bare  
Þat I haue no goode where þat euere y fare
And ȝite I am endited and endetted so þar bye
Of golde þat I haue borwed trewlye
þat while I leue I schal it quite neuer
þat euery man be war be me for euer
What manere man þat casteþ him þer to
If he continue I holde his þreft ydo
For so helpe me god þar by schal he nouht wynne
Bot empte his purce and make his wittes þinne
And whan he þoruhe his madnes and foly
Haþ lost his owen goode þorul Iopardy
þan he exciteþ oþer men þerto
To lese here gode as hem self haþ do
For vnto schrewes Ioye it is an ese
To haue her felowe in peine and disese
  
Thus was I lerned ones of a clerk
Of þat no charge I wil speke of oþer werke
Whan we bene þare as we schal exercise
Oure eluyssche craft we seme wonder wise
Oure termes buen so clergial and so wheinte

And sum time it commeþ sauf vnto þe londe
Pes quod my lorde þe next time I wil fonde
To bringe oure crafte al in anoþere plite
And bote I do sires latt me haue þe wite
There was defaute in sum what wele I wote
An oþere seide þe fire was ouere hote
Bot be hit hote or colde I dar sei þis

We failen of þat whiche þat we wolde haue
And oure madnesse euer more we raue
And whan we bue togeder euerychon

Riht so loo farith it amongus vs
He þat semeþ þe wisest be ihesus
Is most foole whan it commeþ to þe prefe
And he þat semeþ trewest is a þefe
þat schol ȝe knowe er þat I fromme ȝowe wende
Be þat I of my tale haue maade an ende
THer is a chanon of religion
Amonges vs wolde enfecte al a toune
þouhe it as grete were as nynyue
Rome Alisander  Troy  and oþer þre
His sleihtes and his infinite falsenesse
There couþe no man writen as I gesse
þouhe þat he myht leuen a  þowsande ȝere
In al þis of falsnesse ne is his pere
For in his termes he wil him so winde
And speke his wordes in so slyhe a kynde
Whan he comun schal wiþ any wiht
What he wil make him dote anone riht
Bot it þe fende be as his seluen is
Ful mony a man haþe he bigiled ar þis  
And will if þat he maie leue a while
And ȝit men riden and gon ful mony a myle
Him for to seeke and haue acqueyntance
Nat knoweinge of his fals gouernance
And if þe luste to ȝeue me audience
I will it tellen here in ȝoure presence
Bot worschipful chanon religious
Ne demeþ nouht þat I sclander ȝoure house
Al þouhe my tale of chanon be
Of euery order some schrewe is parde
And god forbede þat al a companye
Sholde rewe a singuler mannes folye
To sclander ȝowe is not myne entente
Bot to Corretten þat mys yment
  
This tale was nouȝt onely tolde for ȝowe
Bot eke for oþere mo ȝe woote wele howe

Þere nas no traytur bot Iudas him selue
Than whi scholde þe remenant al haue blame
That giltles were  by ȝowe say I þe same
Sauf only þis if ȝe wil herken me
If any Iudas in ȝoure Couent be
Remoueþ him be time I ȝowe rede
If schame or losse maie causen any drede
And buþe noþinge displesed I ȝowe preie
Bot in þis caas herkeneþ what I wil seie
IN Londen was a preste an annuellere
þat þerinne dwelled had mony a ȝere
Whiche was so plesant and so seruisable
Vnto þe wiff where he was att table
That sche wolde suffur him no þinge for to paye
For borde ne for cloþeinge wente he neuer so gaye
And spendinge siluer hadde he riht ynouhe
þereof no force I wol procede as nowhe
And tel forþe my tale of þe Chanon
þat brouht þis prest to confusion
This fals chanon cam vppon a daye
Vnto þe prestes chambre þer he laye
Besecheinge him to lene him a certeine
Of golde and he wolde white him aȝeine
Lene me a marke quod he bot daies þre
And att my daie I wil it quyte þe  
And it so be þou finde me fals
Anoþer daie honge me be þe hals
This preste him toke a marke and þat als swiþe
And þis chanon him þonked oft siþe
And toke his leue and went forþe his weie
And att þe þered daie brouht his monye
And to þis preste he toke þis golde aȝeine
Thereof þis prest was glad and feine
  
Certes quod he no þinge anoyeþ me
To lene a man a noble or tuo or þre
Or what þinge were in myn possessione
Whan he so trewe is of condicione
þat in no wise breke wil his daie
To suche a man I can neuer saie naye
What quod þis chanon schold I be vntrewe
Naye it were þinge fallen al of þe newe
Treuþe is a þinge þat I wil euer kepe
In to þe daie in whiche þat  schal crepe
In to my graue and elles god forbede
Beleueþ þis as seker as is ȝoure crede
God þonke I and in goode time be it seide
þat þer was neuer man ȝit yuel appaide
For golde ne siluer þat he to me lent
And neuer falsed in myne herte y ment
And sir quod he nowe of my priuete
And seþen  ȝe so goodly haue bue to me
And kiþed to me so grete gentillesse
Som whatte to whiten wiþ ȝoure kindenesse
I wil ȝowe schewe and if ȝowe lust to lere
I schal it schewe to ȝowe anone riht here
Howe I kan worchen in filosophie
Takeþ goode hede ȝe scholn sene wele att ye

Ȝe sir quod þe preste  ȝe sire and wil ȝe so
Mary þereof I praie ȝowe hertely
Att ȝoure commandement sir treuly
Quod þe chanon and elles god forbede
Lo how þis þef couþe  his seruise bede
Ful soþe it is þat suche proferd seruise
Stinkeþe as wittenes þis olde wyse
And þat ful sone I wil  it verifie
In þis chanone is rote of al trecherie  
That euermore delite haþe and gladnesse
Suche fendely þouhtes in his hert empresse
  
Howe cristes peple he maie to meschief bringe
God kepe vs fromme his fals discimulinge
What wist þis preste wiþ whome he delte
Ne of his harme comynge noþinge he felte
O cele preste o celi Innocent
Wiþ Couetise anone þou schalt be blent
O graceles ful blinde is þi conceite
No þinge ert þow war of þi deceit
Whiche þat þis fox schapen haþ to þe
His wyle wrenches þou maiste nouht flyhe
Wherfore to go to þe conclusion

Vnhappe man anone I wil me hihe
To tellen þin vnwitte and þi folye
And eke þe falsenesse of þat oþer wreche
As ferfor as my connynge wil streche
þis chanon was my lorde ȝe wolde wene
Sir oft in faiþe and bue þe heuen quene
It was anoþer chanon and nouht he

He haþ betraied folke mony a time
Of his falsnesse it deliteþ me to rime
Euer whan I speke of his falsede
For schame of him my cheke waxen rede
Al gates þei begon for to glowe
For redenes haue I riht nowe wele I knowe
In my vesage for sinnes diuers
Of Metals whiche ȝe haue herd me reherce
Consumed and wastede haþe myne redenesse
Now takeþ hede of my chanons cursednesse
Sir quod he to þe preste lat ȝoure man gone
Fo whiksiluer þat we is had anone
And latte him bringe vnces tuo or þre
And whan he commeþ als fast schal we se
A wonder þinge whiche ȝe sawe neuer ar þis
Sir quod þe preste it schal be done ywisse
  
He bad his seruant fechen him his þinge
And he al rede was at his bedynge
And went him for and cam anon aȝeine
Wiþ þis whike siluer schortly for to seyne  
And toke þes vnces þre to þe chanone
And he it leide faire and wele adoune
And bad þe seruant coles for to bringe
þat he anone myht go to his wirkeinge
þe coles riht anone weren yfet
And þis chanon toke oute a croselet
Of his bosome and schewe it þe prest
This quod he whiche þat þou sest
Take in þine hande and put þi self þere inne
Of þis whike siluere an vnce and here beginne
In þe name of crist to wex a philosofer
Ther bene ful fewe whiche þat I wil profer
To schewe hem þus muche of my science
For ȝe schol seen here be experience

Riht in ȝoure siht anone wiþ oute lye
And maak it as god siluer and als fyne
As þer is any in ȝoure porce or in myne
And þerto als doulcete and malliable
And elles holde me fals and vnable
Amonge folk euer to appere
I haue a pouder here  it cost me dere
Schal make al good for it is cause of al
Mi konnynge whiche  þat I ȝowe schew shall
Voideþ ȝoure man and lat him be þer oute
An schette þe dore whiles we bene aboute
Oure priuete þat no man vs aspie
Whiles we werken in þis philosophie
Al as he bad ffulfilled was in dede

And his maister schett þe dore anone
An to her laboure spedely þei gone
  
þes preste att þis cursed chanons bydynge
Vpon þe fire anone sett þis þinge
And blewe þe fire and besid him ful fast
And þis chanon in to þis croselett cast
A pouder note I wherof it was
ymaade of chalk oþere of glas
Or sum whatte elles was nouht worþe a flie
To blinde wiþe þis preste and badd him hihe

This Croslet for in token þat I þe loue  
Quod þis chanon þine hondes tuoo
Schal worche al þinge whiche as schal be doo
Gremercy quod þe preste and was ful gladde
And couched coles as þe Chanon badd
And whiles he besy was þis fendely wrecche
þis fals chanon þe foule fende him fecche
Oute of his bosom toke a bechen cole
In whiche ful sotelly was maad an hole
And þereinne pitt was of siluer limaile
An vnce and stopped was wiþ oute faile
This hole wiþ wex to kepe the limal inne
An vnderstondeþ þat þis false gynne
Was not maade þere bot it was maade to fore
And oþer þinges I schal tel more
Here after warde whiche þat he wiþ him brouht
Ar he com þere to begile him he þouht
And so he dide are he went a twynne
Til he had tornyd him kouþe he not blinne
It dulleþ me whan þat I of him speke
On his fals hede faine wolde I me awreke
If I wist howe bot he is here and þere
He is so variant he bideþ no where
Bo takeþ hede nowe sires for goddes loue
He toke his cole of whiche I spak aboue
And in his honde he bare it priuely
And whiles þe priste couched besili
  
þe coles as I tolde ȝow er þis
þis Chanon seide frende ȝe done amys
þis is nouht couched as it ouht to be
Bot sone I schal amend it quod he
Nowe lat me medel þerewiþ bot a while
For of ȝoue haue I pete be sein gile
ȝe been riht hote I see wele how ȝe swete
Haue here a cloþe and wype aweie þe wete
And whan þe prest him wyped haas
This Chanon toke his cole I schrewe his face
And leid it vpon abouen þe Midward
Of þe croselett  And blewe wele afterward
Til þat þe Coles gan fast berne
Now ȝif vs drinke quod þe Chanone þann
Als swiþe al schal be wele I vndertake
Sit we doune and lete vs mery make  
And whann þe chanons bechen cole
Was brente al þe limal oute of the hole
Into þe croselet anone fel adoune
And so it mot nedes be resoune
Seþþen it so heuen aboue couched was
Bot þereof wist no þinge þe preste alas
He demed al þe coles ylyche goode
For of þe sleyht no þinge he vnderstode
And whan þis Alkamistrie sauhe is time
Riseþ vp sir priste and stonde be me
And for I wote Ingote haue ȝe none
Goþe walkeþ forþe and bringeþ a chalke stone
For I wil make it of þe same schappe
þat is an Ingote if I maie haue happe
And bringe wiþe ȝowe a bol or a panne
Ful of water and ȝe schal see þanne
How þat oure besines schal happe and preue
And ȝit for ȝe schal haue no mysbeleue
Ne wronge conseite of me in ȝoure absence
I wil nouht bue oute of ȝoure presence
  
Bot go wiþ ȝowe and com wiþ ȝow ageine
The chamber dore schortly to seine
Thei opened and schette and went forþe her waie
And forþe wiþ hem þei caried þe keie
And comen aȝeine wiþ outen any delaye
What scholde I tary al þe longe daie
He toke · þe chalke and schoppe it in þat wise
Of an Ingote as I schal ȝowe deuise
I seye he tok out of his owen sleue
A cheyne of siluer  yuel mot he cheue
Whiche þat was bot an vnce of wheyht
And takeþ hede nowe of his cursede sleyht
He schop his Ingote in lengeþ and in brede
Of þe cheyne wiþ outen any drede
So slely þat þe preste it nouht aspide
And in his sleue aȝeine he gan it hide
An frome þe fire toke vp his matier
And in to þe yngote it putte wiþ meri chere
And in to þe water vessel he it kest
Whan þat him lust and badde þe preste as fast
Loke what þere is put in þine honde and grope
Thou schalte finde þer siluer as I hope  
What deuel of hel scholde it elles be
Chaueynge of siluer silue is parde
He putte in his honde and tok vp a teyne
Off siluer fyne and glad in euery veine
Was þis priste whan he sauhe þat it was so
Goddes blissinge and his moders also
And al halowes haue ȝe sir Chanon
Seid þe preste and I here Malison
Bot and ȝe vouche sauf to teche me
This noble craft and þis soteltie
I wil be ȝoures in al þat euer I maie
Quod þe chanone ȝit wil I make asaie

And bee experte of þis and in ȝoure nede
  
Anoþer daie in Mine absence
This discipline and þis crafte science
Lat take anoþer vnce quod he þo
Of whiche siluer wiþþe outen wordes moo
And do þerwiþ as ȝe haue done ar þis
Wyþe þat oþere whiche þat nowe siluere is
This preste him besieþ in al þat he can
To done as þis chanone þis cursed man
Commandeþ him  and fast blewe þe fire
For to come to þeffette of his desire
And þis chanon riht in þe mene while
Al redi was þis preste oft to begile
And for a countenance in his honde bare
An holowe stikke take hede and be ware
In þe ende of whiche an vnce and no more
Of siluer lymal put was al before
Was in his coule and stopped wiþ wax wele
for to kepe inne his lymal euereydele
And while þis preste was in his besinesse
This chanon wiþ his stike gan him dresse
To him anone and his pouder kast inne
As he dide ere þe deuel out of his kinne
Him torne I praie to god for his falsehede
For he was euer fals in worde and dede
And wiþ his stikke aboue þe croselett
That was ordeygned wiþ þat fals gett
He stireþ þe coles til relent gan
The wex aȝeine þe fire as euery man  
Bot it a fole be wote wele and mot nede
And al þat in þe hole was oute ȝede
And in to þe croselet hastely it fel
þe preste supposed nouht bot wele
Bot busid him fast and was wonder feyne
Supposinge nouht bot treuþe soþe to seine
He was so glad I can nouht expresse
In no manere his merþe and his gladnesse
  
And to þe Chanon he proferd eft sone
Body and goode ȝe quod þe chanone sone
þouhe poure I be crafte þou schalt me finde
I warne þe ȝit is þere more behinde
Is þere any coper here inne seide he

Elles go by sum and þat aswyþe
Nowe sir go for þi waie and hyhe þe
And went his waie and wiþ his coper he came
And þis chanon in his hode it name
And of þat coper weyde oute bot an vnce
Al to simple is my tonge to pronounce
His mostre and his witte þe doublenesse
Of þis chanone rote of Corsednesse
He semed frendly to him þat knewe him nouht
Bot he was fendely boþe in werke and þouht
It werieþ me to telle of his falsenesse
And neþeles ȝit wil I it expresse
To þat entent þat men maie be war þere bye
And for none oþer cause treulye
He putte þis vnce of coper in to þe crosellet
And on þe fire also swiþe he haþe it sett
And kest in pouder and maade þe preste to blowe
And in his worcheinge for to stoupe lowe
As he dide erst and al was bott a Iape
Riht as him lust þe preste he maade his ape
And afterwarde in to þe Ingote he it kest
And in þe panne put it att þe last
Of water and inne he put his owen honde
And in his sleue as ȝe beforne honde
Herde me tell he had a siluer cheyne
He slyhely toke is oute þis cursed hyne
Vnwetinge þis preste of his fals craft
And in þe pannes bothom he haþ it left  
And in þe water rumbleþ to and fro
And wonder priuely toke it vpp also

And hid it and hent him be þe breste
And to him spak and þus seide he in his game
Stoupeþe adoune be god ȝe be to blame
Helpeþe me nowe as I dide ȝowe whilere
Put in ȝoure honde and loke what is þere
This preste toke vppe þis siluer teyne anone
And þan seide þe Chanon latt vs gone
Wiþ þes þre teynes whiche þat we haue wrouht
To summe gōlsmyþe and wit if it be owhte
For be my feiþe I nolde for myne hode

And þat as swyþe proued schal he be
Vnto þe goldsmythe wiþ þes teynes þre

To fire and hamur myht no man seie naie
Bot þei were as hem ouht to be

Was neuer bridde gladder aȝeines þe daie
Ne nyhtgale in þe seson of maie
Was neuere none þat lust better to singe
Ne lady lustier in Carolynge
And for to speke and loue and wommanhede
Ne knyhte in armes done an hardy dede
To stonden in grace of his ladie dere
þan hadde þis preste þis craft to lere
And to þe chanon þus he spak and seide
For þe loue of god þat for us al deyde
And as I maye deserue it vn to ȝowe
What schal þis receyte cost telleþ nowe
Be oure lady quod þis chanon it is dere

In yngelonde þere can no man it make
No fors quod he now sir for goddes saake

And ne were þe frindeschippe þat ȝe dide ar þis
To me ȝe scholde paie more ywys  
This preste þe summe of xl pounde anone
Of nobles fette  and toke hem euerychone
To þis Chanon for þis ilke receit
Al his worcheinge was fraude and deceite
Sire preste he seide I kepe for haue no los
Of my craft for I wolde it were kepped clos
And as ȝe loueþe me kepeþ it secre
For and men knewe al my subtilite
Be god men wolde haue so grete envie
To me be cause of my philosophie

For ȝoure goode wil sire haue ȝe riht good prefe
Quod þe chanone wele graunt mercie
He went his waye and neuer þe priste him sihe
After þat daie and whan þat þis preste schold
Maken assay  att suche time as he wolde
Of þis receyte fare wele it wil nouht be
Lo þus beIaped and begiled was he
Thus makeþ he his introduccion
To bringe folke to hire destruccion
 Considereþ sires howe þat myche astate
Betwex men and golde þar is debate
So ferforþe þat vnneþes þere is one
This multepliynge blindeþ · so mony one

This Phylosophres speken so mystelye
In þis craft þat men can nouht com þer bye
  
For any witte þat men haue nowe a dayes

Lo suche a locre is in þis lusty game
A mannes merþe it wil torne al to gram
And empte also grete and heuy porces

Of hem þat han þereto here good ylente

For ȝif ȝe done ȝoure þreft  is gone ful clene
And riht als swiþe I wil ȝoue to here
What þat þe Philosophres seine in þis matiere

And þerfore seide he take hede to my sawe
Latt no man besy hime þis arte for to seche
Bot he þat þe entencion and speche
Of Philosofres vnderstonde kan
And if he doo he is a lewde man
For þis science and þis connynge quod he 
Is of secre of secretees parde  
Also þere was a disciple of Plato

As his booke sonier wil bere wittnesse
And þis was his demaunde in soþefastnesse
Tel me þe name of þe priue stoone
And plato ansewerd vnto him anone
Take þat titanus men name
Whiche is þat quod he Magnesia is þe same
Seide Plato ȝe sire and es it þus

What is magnesia good sire I preie
It is a water þat is maad I seie
Of elementes foure quod plato
Tel me þe roches good sir quod he þo
Of þat water if it be ȝoure will
Naie Naie quod plato certeine þat I nyll
The philosophres were sworne euerychon

Ne in no booke it write in no manere
For vnto criste it is so leue and dere

Bot where so it likeþ to his deite
Man to enspire and eke to defende
Whome þat him lykeþ lo þis is þe ende
That conclude I þus seþen þat god of heuen
Ne wil not þat þe philofres neven
Howe þat a man schal com vnto þis stone

For who so makeþ god his aduersarie
As for to worche any þinge in contrarye
Vnto his wil certes neuer schal he þriue

And þere a pointe for endid is my tale

Quod þe Maister of Phisik a tale þat I finde writte
In cronyke passed of olde tyme

Ther was as telleþ vs titus liueus
A knyht þat cleped was virgineus
Fulfilled of honoure and worþinesse
And stronge of frendes and of riches
A douhtere he hadd be his wyf
And neuer hadde he mo in al his lif

Abouen euery whight þat maie see
For Nature haþe wiþ souereigne diligence

Pigmalyon nouht þouhe he alweie forge or bete

Apollus ȝepherus schold werche in veine
To graue or peinte or forge or bete
If þei presumed me for to counterfete
For he þat is þe formour principal
Haþe maade me his viser general
To forme and peinte eche erþely creature
Riht as me lest for al þinge is in my cure
Vnder þe mone þat maie wane and wax
And for my werke no þinge wil I ax

So do I al myn oþere creatures
Of  colour þei bue or what figures
Thus semeþ me þat Nature wold seie
This maide was of age twelue ȝere and tweye
In whiche þat Nature haþe suche delite
For riht as sche kan peinte as lyle white  
An Rode as rose riht wiþ suche peinture
Sche peinted haþe þis noble creature
Ar sche was borne vppon hire limmes fre
Were als briht as suche coloures scholde be
And phebus hadd dyed hire tresses grete
Lyke to þe stremes of his burned hete
And if þat excellent was hire beute
A þousand folde mor vertuous was sche
In hire ne lakkeþ no condicione
þat is to preise as be discrecione
As wele in body  as goste chast was schee
For whiche sche floured in virginite
Wiþ al humilite and abstinence
And wiþ al attemperance and pacience
Wiþ mesure eke and bereinge of araie
Discrete sche was in ansewaringe alweie
þouhe sche were wise as pallas dar I seine
Hire faukonde eke ful wommanly and pleyne
None conterfeted termes hadde sche
To seme wise bot after hire degre
Sche spakk and al hir wordes more and lesse
Souneinge in vertue and in gentillesse
Schamefast sche was in maidens schamfastnesse
Constant in hert and euer in his besinesse
To dryue hire oute of hire slogardie
Bachus hadde of hire mouþe no maistre
For wil and þouht to done venus encrese
As men in fire wil kasten oyle or grese
  
And of hir owen vertue vnconstreyned
Sche haþe ful oft time hire seke feyned
For þat sche wolde flye þe companye
Where likly was to treten of folye
As es att festes reueles and att daunces

Suche þinges maken childern for to bee
To sone Ripe and bolde as men maie see
Whiche is ful perilous and haþe be ȝore
For al to sone maie sche leren lore
Of boldenesse whan sche is a wyfe
And ȝe maistresses in ȝoure olde life

Ne takeþ of mi worde no displesance  
Thinges þat bien set in gouernynges
Of lordes douhtres only for tuo þinges
Eyþer for ȝe han kepped ȝoure honeste
Or elles ȝe haue fall in frelte
And knowe wele ynowhe þe olde daunce
And konne forsaake fully meschaunce
For euere mo þerfore for crist saak
Kepeþ wel þo þat ȝe vndertak
A þef of venison þat haþ forlaft

Kan kepe a forest best  ony man
Nowe kepeþe hem wele for ȝe wele can
Lokeþ wele to no vice þat ȝe assent
Lest  be dampned for ȝoure yuel entent
For who so doþe a traitour is certeine
And takeþ of þat þat I schal seine
Of al treson suffreine pestelence

Ȝe faders and ȝe moders eke also
Þouhe ȝe haue childern be it on or mo

Whiles þei bien vnder gouernance

Ȝif þat þei done ȝe schol ful sore abye
Vnder a scheperd soft and necligent

Sufficit one ensample nowe as here
For I most torne aȝeine to matiere
This maide of whiche y tel my tale expresse
Sche kepped hir self sche neded no maistresse
For in hire leueynge maydens myht rede
As in a boke euery good worde and dede

Sche was so prudent and so bounteuous
For whiche oute spronge on euery side
Boþe of hir beute and hire bounte wide

And gladde is of his sorwe and vnhele  
The doctour makeþ þis descripcioune
This maide went on a daie into þe toune
Towarde þe temple wiþ hir moder dere
As is of ȝonge Maidens þe manere
Nowe was þer a Iustice in þe toune

And so befel þis Iuge his eyȝen kast
Vppon þis maide aviseinge hire ful fast
As sche cam forþ by þere þe Iuge stode
Anone his hert chaungeþ and his moode
So was he cauht wiþ þe beaute of þis maide
And to him self ful priuely he seide
This maiden schal be myne for any man
Anone þe fende in to his hert ran
And tauht him sodanly be what sleyht
The maiden to his purpos wynne he myht
  
For certes be no force ne be no meede
Him þouht he was not able for to spede
For he was stronge of frendes and eke sche
Confermed was in suche souereigne beute
That wele he wist he myht hire neuer wynne
As for to maake hire wiþ hire bodi synne
For whiche wiþ grete deliberacioune
He sent after a clerk in to þe toune
The whiche he knewe ful sotel and ful bolde
This Iuge haþe vnto þis clerke his tale ytolde
In secre wise and maade him to assure
He schold tel it to no creature
And if he dide he scholde lese his hede
And whan assented was þis cursed rede
Gladde was þe Iuge and maade goode chiere
And ȝaf him ȝeftes precious and dere
Whan schapen was al þis conspiracie
From pointe to pointe howe þat his licherye
Performed schold be ful sotellye
As ȝe schal heren afterward openlye
Home goþe þis clerk þat hiht Claudius
This fals Iuge þat hiht Apius
So was his name it is no fable
Bot knowen for an historall þinge notable
The sentence of it soþ is oute of doute
This fals Iuge goþ nowe faste aboute  
To hasten his delite al þat he maie
And so befel sone after on a daie
Þis fals Iuge as telleþ vs þe storie
As he was wonte satt in his Consistorie
And ȝaue his domes vpon sundre caas
This fals clerke cam forþe a wel good paas
And seide lorde if þat it be ȝoure will
As doþe me riht vpon þis pitous bill
In whiche I pleine vpon virgineus
And if þat he wil seine it is nouȝ þus
  
I wille preue it and finde good wittenesse

The Iuge Ansewerde of þis in his absence

Latt done him call  and I wil gladly here
Thou schalt haue riht and no wronge here
Virgineus came to wite þe Iuges will
And riht anone was redde þis cursed bill
þe sentence of hit was as ȝe schal here
To ȝowe my lorde sir Apius so dere
Scheweþ ȝoure pouer seruant Claudius
Howe þat a knyht called virgineus
Aȝeines þe lawe aȝeines al equite
Holdeþ expresse aȝeines þe wil of me

Whiles sche was ful ȝonge I will  it preue
Be wittenesse lorde so þat ȝe ȝowe nouht greue
Sche his nouht his douhter what so he seie
Wherefor my lorde þe Iugge to ȝowe I preie
Ȝelde me my þrall if it be ȝoure wil
Lo þis was þe sentence of þe bil
Virgineus began vpon þe clerke beholde
Bote hastely ar he his tale tolde
He wolde haue defended it as scholde a knyht
And be wittenesse of mony a trewe wyht
That al was fals þat seide his aduersarie
This Cursed Iuge wolde no longer tarie
Ne here a worde more of Virgineus
Bot ȝaf his Iugement and seide þus
I deme anone þis clerk his seruant haue
Thou schalt no longer in þin house hir saue  
Go bringe hir forþe and bringe hir in owre warde
This clerk schal haue his þralle þus I awarde
And whan þis worþi knyht Virgineus
Thoruhe þassent of þe Iuge Apius
  
Most be force his dere douhter ȝeuen
Vnto þe Iuge in lichere to leuen
He goþe him home and sett him in his hall
And lete anone his dere douhter call
And wiþ a face dede as asshen colde
Vpon hire hum face he gan beholde
Wiþ faders pite stikinge þoruhe his hert
Al wolde he nouht from his purpos conuert
Douhter quod he virginea be þi name
There bien tuo weys eyþer oþer schame

For neuer þou deseruest where fore
To deyen wiþ a swerde or wiþ a knyf
O der douhter ender of my lif
Whiche I haue fosterd vp wiþ suche plesance

O douhter whiche þat ert my last woo
And in lif my last ioy also
O gemme of chastite in pacience
Take þou þi deþ for þis is my sentence
For loue and nouht for hate þou must be dede
My pitous honde most smyte of þin hede
Alas þat euer Apius þe seyhe
Thus haþe he falsly Iugged þe to day
And tolde hire al þe cas as ȝe before
Haue herd it nedeþ nouht to tel it no more
Merce dere fadere quod þis maide
And wiþe þat worde sche boþe hire armes leide
Aboute his nekke as sche was wont to do
The teres barsten oute of hire yen tuo
And seide goode fader schal I deye
Is þere no grace is þere no remedie
No certes dere douhter myne quod he
Than ȝeue me leue fader myn quod sche

For parde Ieffa ȝaue his douhter grace
  
For to compleine ar he hir slowhe alas
And god it wote no þinge was hire trespas  
Bot þat sche rann hir fader first to see
To welcom him wiþ grete solempnite
And wiþ þat worde sche fel in swoune anone
And after whan hir swounynge was agone
Sche riseþ vpe and to hire fader seide
Blissed be god þat I schal deye a meide
ȝif me my deþe ar þat I haue a schame
Doþe wiþ ȝoure Childe ȝoure wil a goddes name
And wiþ þat word sche praieþ ful oft

And wiþ þat word in swoune doune sche felle
Hir fader wiþ ful sorweful hert and felle
Hire heued of smote and be toppe it hent
And to þe Iuge he ȝaue it to present
As he satt in his dome in consistorie
Whan þe Iuge it sauhe as seiþe þe storie
He badde take him and honge him also fast
Bot riht anone al þe peple in þrast
To saue þe knyht for reuþe and for pyte
ffor knowen was þe foles iniquite
þe peple anone hadd susspecte in þis þinge
Be maner of þis clerkes chalangeinge
þat it was be þe assent of Apius
That wist wele þat he was lycherous
ffor whiche vnto þis Apius þei gone
And kesten him in prison riht anone
Whereas he slowhe him selfe and Claudius
That seruant was vnto þis Apius
Was demed for to honge vpon a tre
Bot virgineus of his grete Pite
Praide for him þat he was exiled
And elles certes he hadde be bygilede
The remenant were honged more and lesse
That consented were to þis cursednesse
  
Here maye men see how sinne haþe his merite
Be war for no man wote howe god wil smyte
In no degre ne in wyche maner wise
þe werme of conscience wil arise
Of wikked lif þouhe it so priue be
þat no man woot of it bot god and he
Wheþer he be lewde man or lerede
He note howe sone  he maie bee aferde
Therfore rede I ȝowe þis counsel take  
Forsakeþ sinne ar sinne ȝoue forsake
Owre Oste gan swere as he ware wode
Harrowe quod he be Nayles and be blode
This was a cussed þef a fals Iustice
A schendful deþe as hert can deuise
So fal vpon his body and his bones
Þe deuel I beken him al att ones
Alas to dere bouht sche hir beute
Wherefor I seie þat al men maie see

Beþe cause of deþe of mony a creature
Hire beute was hir deþe I dare wele seine
Alas how pitously as sche was sleine
Bot hereof wil I nouht procede as nowe
Men haue ful often more harme þan prowe
Bot trewly myne owen maister dere
This is a pitous tale for to here

And þine vrinals and þi Iordanes

And after þat tel I forþe my tales

Of Patriarkes and of Bischopes I schewe
And in latine I speke wordes a fewe
To sauern wiþ my predicacione
And for to ster men to deuocione
þan schewe I forþe my longe cristal stones
Ycrammed ful of cloutes and of bones
Relekes þei buen as ween þei euerychon
Than haue I in laton a scholdere bone
Whiche þat was an holy Iewes schepe
Goodmen saie I takeþe of my wordes kepe
If þat þis bone bue wasche in any welle
Of cowe or calfe schepe or oxe swelle

Touche he þis bone anone he schal be sounde
And ȝit also forþermore of pokkes and scabbes and of euery sore
Schal euery schepe be hole þat of þis well

And þilke holy Iewe oure helders ones tauht

And sires also it heleþ Ielousye  
And þouhe a man be fal in Ielowsie rage

And neuer schal he more his wif mestruste

Al hadde sche taken prestes tueyne or þre
Here is a Metaine eke ȝe maye see

Whan he haþe sowen be it whete or otes
So þat of pens oþer of grotes
And men and wemmen o þinge warn I ȝowe
If any whight be in þis cherche nowe

Or any womman be sche ȝonge or olde

Suche folke schal haue no powere no grace
To offer to my relikes in þis place
And who so findeþ him oute of suche blame

And I assoile him be þe auctorite
Suche as be bul was graunted me
Be þis Gaude haue I wonne euery ȝere
An C mark seþen I was pardonere

And schewe þe lewde peple and doune þei sitt

And tel an hundreþ Iapes more
Than peyne I me to strecche forþe my nekke
And est and west uppon þe peple I bekke
As doþe a doue sittinge vpon a berne
Myne hondes and my tonge go so ȝerne

Of avarise and suche oþer cursednesse
Is as Mi preccheinge to make hem fre
To ȝeue here pens namely vnto me
For myne entent is nouht bot for to wynne
And no þinge for correction of sinne
I reke neuer whan þat þei be buried

For certes mony a predicaciōne

To ben auaunsed for ypocresye
And somme for veynglory and somme for hate  
ffor when I dar nought oother weys debate
Thenne wolly stynge him with my tunge smert

To ben defamed falsly if that he
Hath trespased to myn britheren other to me
ffor though I telle nought his propre name
Men shal wel knowe that hit is the same
Bothe by seignes and oother circumstaunces
Thus  rule I folk that doth vs displesances
Thus spitte I myn venym vnder hewe
Of holinesse to seme holy and trewe
But shortly myn entent wol I deuyse
I preche of no thing but of Coueytise
Therfore my teme is ȝet and euer was
Radix malorum est cupiditas
Thus kan I preche ayayns that same vice
Suche þat I vse and þat is of auarice    
Bot þeihe I me self be gilte in þat sinne
Ȝit kanne I maake oþer folke to wynne
Fromme auarice and sore to repent
Bot þat nes nouht myn principal entent

Of þis matiere it ouȝte ynowhe suffise

Of Olde stories longe time agone
For lewde peple louen tales olde

What trowe ȝe whiles þat I maie preche
And wynne gold and siluer for I teche

An make basketes and leue þerebye
Because I wil nouht bigge ydelye

I wil haue mony chese and whete
Al were it ȝeuen of þe porest page
Eyþer of þe pourest wedowe in a vilage
Al schold hir childerne sterue for famyne
Nay I wil drinke þe lycoure of þe vine
And haue a Ioly wenche in euerych toune
Bot herkeneþ lordynges in conclusione
Ȝoure lykeinge is þat I schal tel a tale
Nowe I haue droke a drauhte of Corne ale
Be god I hope I schal tel ȝowe a þinge

A moreil tale ȝit I ȝowe telle can
Whiche I am wont to preche for to wynne
Now holde ȝoure pes my tale I wil beginne  
IN flaundres whilom was a compaignie
Of ȝonge folke þat hawten folye

And eten and drenke also ouer al here myht
Thorwhe whiche þei done þe deuel sacrifise

And yche of hem att oþer sinnes lowhe
And riht anone þan came tomblesters

Singers wiþ harpes baudes waferes
Such bien þe deuel officiers
To kendel and blowe þe fire of lychery
þat is annexed to glotonye
þe holy writte take I to wittenesse
þat lycherie is in wyne and dronkennesse
Lo howe þat dronken lothe vnkindelye
Lay be his douhtres tuo vnweteynglye
So dronke he was he nest what he wrouht
And þerfore sore repent him ouhte
Herodes who so wil þe story seche

Whan he of wine was replete att his feste
Riht att his owen table ȝaf his heste
To slene þe Baptiste Iohn ful gilteles

O glotony ful of cursednesse
O cause firste of oure confusione

Lo howe dere and schortly was to seine
Aboute was þe cursed velanye
Corrupte was al þis werld þoruhe glotonye

Were dreue for þat vice it is no drede
For whiles þat adam fasted as I rede
He was in paradise and whan þat hee

Anone he was out cast to woo and pyne  
O glotonye on þe wele ouht vs to pleine
O wist a man howe many maladies

Of his Diet sittinge att þe table

Of whiche þe ende is deþe þe wombe is hire god

Att eyþe ende of þe foule is þe soune

And turne substance into accident

O dronken man disfigured is þi face
Foul is þi breþ  foule ert þou to embrace
And þoruhe þi drongen nose semeþe þi soune  
As þouhe þou ay said Samson samsoune
And ȝit goode wotte Samson dranke neuer wyne

For dronkenes is verreie sepultures
Of mannes witte and his discrecion
In whome þat drinke haþ dominacion

Now kepe ȝowe fro þe white and fro þe reede
Namely fro þe white wyne of lepe

In oþer wynes groweinge fast by
Of whiche þere riseþ suche fumosite

And weneþ þat he be att home in chepe

And þan wille þei seyn Sampsone Sampsone
Bot herken lordeynges o worde I ȝow preie

Of victories in þe olde testament

Loke þe bible and þere ȝe maie it leere
Loke Atthela þe grete conqueroure
Deyed in his slepe wiþ schame and dishonoure

A Capeteigne schold leue in soburnesse
And ouer al þis avise ȝow riht wele

Redeþe þe bible and findeþ it expresly
Of wyne ȝifinge to hem þat han Iustice
No mor of þis for it mai wele suffice
A now þat I haue spoke of glotonye
Nowe wil I defend ȝowe hasardye
Hasard is verreye moder of lesinges
And of deceyte Cursed forswereinges
Blaspheme of criste and mansleinges also
Of bataile oft time and of oþer mo
It is repreue and contrarie to honoure  
ffor to be holde a commune hasardoure
  
And euer þe hihere he his of state
þe more yhalden is he dissolate
If þat a prince vse hasardie
In al gouernance and al policie
He is as be commune opinion
Ihalde þe lasse in reputacion

Was sent into Corynthe with ful gret honour  
ffro Calidonye to maken hem alleaunce
And whan he cam him happed þis chaunce
That al þe grettest þat were of þis lande

For whiche as sone as þat miht be

And seide þere I wold nouht lese my name

Ȝowe for to alleye to none hasardoures
Sendeþ oþere wise embassadoures
For be my trouþe me were leuer deye

For ȝe þat bien so glorious in honoures
Schall nouȝt alleye ȝowe wiþ asardoures
As be my will ne as be my trete
This wise philosophre þus seide to me
Looke þou vse no pleie of dees in þin house
Looke eke þat þe kinge demetrius
Sent him a paire of dees of golde in scoren
For he hadd vsed hasardry þer beforne
For whiche he held his glorie and renoune
And no valewe of reputacione
Lordes myhten finde oþere manere pleie
Honest ynouhe to driue þe daie aweie
Now wole I speke of othes fals and grete
A worde or tuo as oþere bookes trete
Grete swereynge is a þinge abhominable
And fals swereinge is more repreueable
  
The hihe god forbad swereinge att al

Of swereinge seiþe holy Ieromye
Thowe shalt swere soþe þine oþes and nouht lye

Of hihe goddes hestes honurable
How þat þe secunde hest of him is þis
Take nouht my name in Idelnesse amys
Lo raþer he forbedes suche suereinge
Or Omyside or any oþer Cursed þinge

How þat þe secunde hest of god is þat
And forþermore I wil þe tel al plat

Be goddes precious hert and his nayles
And be his blode þat is in hayles
Seuen is myn chaunce and þine is fyue and þre
Be goddes armes if þou falsly pleie me
This dagger schal þoruhe þine hert go
This fruyte commeþ of þe becched bones tuo

And loke þat þoue reporte his name wele

Al sodenly was he sleine to nyht
Fordronke as he satt vp his benche vpriht
Ther cam a priue þefe þat men clepen deþe
That in his contre al þe peple sleþe
And wiþ his spere he smot his hert a tuo
And went is waie wiþouten wordes mo
And Maister ar ȝe com in his presence

For to bue war of suche an aduersarie  
Beþ rede for to mete him euermore
Thus tauht me my dame I seie no more
Be seinte Marie seyde þis tauernere
This childe seiþ soþe for he haþ sleine to ȝere
Hennes ouere a Mile wiþinne a gret village
Boþe man and womman childe and page

To been avisede grete wisdome it weere
Ere þat he dide a man dishonoure
Ȝe goddes armes quod þis Rietoure

As þouhe he ware his owen sworne broþer
  
And vpe þei stert al dronken in þis rage
And forþe þei gone towarde þat vilage
Of whiche þe tauernere haþ spoken beforne
And mony a grisely oþe þen haue þei sworne

And seid þus for I can nouȝt finde
A man þouhe þat I walked vnto ynde

And þerfore most I haue my age stille

See ȝe þat ooke riht þere ȝe schulne him finde
God saue ȝowe þat bouht ȝeine mankinde  
And ȝowe amend þus seide þis olde manne

Bott trewly be daie it maie nouht be

And for owre owen tresoure done vs honge

To bringe vs brede and wyne ful priuely
And tuo of vs schal kepe ful subtelly

Whanne þat it is nyht we wollen þis tresor karien
Be one assent where as vs lust beste
An kuttes one of hem brouht in his fiste
And badde hem drawe and loke on whome it wolde fall
And it fell on þe ȝongest of hem all
And forþe towarde þe toune he went anone
And also sone as he was gone
The tone of hem spake þus vnto þe toþere
Thou wost wele þat þou ert myn owen sworne broþere  
Thin profite wil I tel þe anone

And I schal tel in wordes fewe

Now quod þe first þou woste wele we be tueye
And tueyne of vs schal stronger bien þan one
Looke whan he is sett and þat anone

And I schal renne him þoruhe þe sides tueye
Whiles þat þou stroglest wiþ him in game
And wiþ þi dagger loke þou do þe same
And þanne schal al þis golde departed be
My dere frende betuex me and þe
Than maie we boþe oure lustes fulfille
And pleie att dees riht att oure owen will
And þus accorded bien þe schrewes tueye
To sle þe þredde as ȝe herd me seie

Ful oft in hert he rolleþ vpe and doune

O lorde quod he if so were þat I myht
Al þis tresore winne to my self alone
þere is no man þat leueþ vnder þe throne
Of god þat schold leue as mery as I
And att þe last þe fende oure enemye
Put in his þouht þat he scholde poyson bye
With whiche he miht sleyne his felawes tueye
For whi þe fend fonde him in suche leueynge
That hadde leue him to sorwe bringe
  
For þis was vtterly his entent
To slene hem boþe and neuer to repent  
And forþe he goþe No longer wold he tarye
Into þe toune vnto a potecarie
And preide him þat he wold him sell

And eke þere was a polkat in his hawe

In al þis werlde þer nys no creature

Not bot þe mountance of a corne of whete

Ȝe sterue he schal and þat in lesse while

This poyson is so stronge and so violent
This cursed man haþ in his hande yhente
þis poysen in a box and seþen he ranne
Into þe next strete vnto a man
And borwed him large botels þre
And in þe tueyne þis poyson poured he

For al þe nyht he schop him to swynke
In cariynge of þe golde out  þat place
And whan þis ryetoure wiþ sory grace
Hadde filled wiþ him his grete boteles þre
To his felawes aȝeine repaireþ he
What nedeþ it to sermon þerof more
For riht as þei had kast his deþe tofore
Riht so þei haue him sleyne and þat anone
And whan þat þis was done þan spak þe tone
Nowe lat vs drinke and sitte and make vs merye
And afterward we wollen his body berye
  
And efteward it happed him percas
To take þe botel þerin þe poyson was
And drange and ȝaue his felawe drinke also
For whiche anone þei storuen boþe tuo
Bott certes I suppose þat Aucyenne
Wrote neuer in no canon ne in no fenne

Thus hadde þes wriches tuo here endeinge  
Thus ended buen þes homicides tuo

If it were ȝoure pleseinge I wote wele sekurlye
Sertes quod þis Schipman a tale I can tell
And þefore herkeneþ hyderward how þat I wil spell
A Marchant whilom dwelled att sein Denys  
That riche was for whiche men helde him wys
A wif he hadde of excellent beaute
And compinable and reuerent was sche
Whiche is a þinge þat causeþ more dispence
Then worþe is al þe chier and reuerence
That men haue done att festes or at daunces
Suche Salutacions and countenaunces
Passeþ as doþe þe schadowe on a wall
Bot woo is him þat paie most for all
The Cely husbonde algates he must paye
He moste vs cloþe and vs araie
Al for his owen woschip richelye
In whiche araie we dauncen Iolylye
And if þat he nouht maie paraduenture
Or elles luste no suche to endure
Bot þenkeþ it is waste and yloste
þat mot anoþere payen for owre coste
Or leue vs golde and þat is parilous
This noble marchant helde a noble hous
ffor whiche he had al daye grete repaire
ffor his largenesse and for his wif was faire
That wonder is bot herkeneþ to my tale
Amonges al his gestes grete and smale
Ther was a monke a faire man and a bolde
I trowe  a þerte wynter he was of olde
That euere in one was draweinge to þe place
This ȝonge monke þat was so faire of face
  
Aqweynted was so wiþ þis goodman
Seþen þatt her first knowleche began
That in his hous as famylier was he
As it is possible any frende to be
And for als muchel as þe good manne
And eke þis monke of whiche þat I beganne
Were boþe tuo borne in o vilage
þe monke him clayme as for cosinage
And he aȝeine he seiþ nouht ones naye
Bot was as glad þereof as foule of daye
ffor to his herte it was a grete plesaunce
Thus bene þei knytt wiþ eterne alliaunce
And ilke of hem gan oþer to assure
Of broþerhed whiles þat þeire lyue maie endure
ffre was dan Iohn and namely of dispense  
As in þat hous and ful of diligence
To do plasance and also grete Costage
He nouht forȝate to ȝeue þe lest page
In al þat hous bot after here degre
He ȝaf þe lorde and seþen al þe meyne
Whan þat he cam sum maner honest þinge
ffor whiche þei were al gladd of his comynge
As foule is feine whan sonne vpriseþ
No more of þis as now for it suffiseþ
Bot so befel þis marchant vpon a daie
Schope him to make rede his araie
Towarde þe toune of Brugges for to fare
To byen þere a porcion of ware
ffor whiche he haþe to parische sent anone
A messagier and preide haþe dan Iohn
Thas he scholde come to seinte Denys and pleye
Wiþ him and wiþ his wif a dai or tweye
Are he to brugges wente in al wise
þis noble Monke of whiche I ȝowe deuise
Haþ of his Abbot as him lust lycenc
Because he was a man of hihe prudence
  
And eke an Oficere oute for to ride
To se here graunges and her bernes wide
And vnto Seint Denys he comeþ anone
Who was so welcom as my lorde dan Iohne
Oure dere Cosyn ful of Curtasye
With him brouht a Iubbe of Maluese
And eke anoþer ful of goode vernage
And volatile as aie was his vsage
And þus I lete hem ete and dringe and pleie

The þred daie þis Marchant vp he riseþ
And on his nedes sadly him aviseþ
And vp into his counte hous goþe he
To reken wiþ himself wel maie be
Of þilke ȝere howe þat wiþ him stode
And howe þat he despended had his goode
And if þat he encresed were or none
His bokes and his bagges many one
He leyþe befor him on his counteingborde
fful riche was his tresore and his horde
ffor whiche ful fast his counterhous dore he schette  
And eke he nolde no man schold him lette
Of his accomptes for þe mene time
And þus he sitte til it was passed prime
Dan Iohn was resen in þe morne also
And in gardyn wakkeþ to and fro
And haþe his þinges seide deuoutly
This good wif cam walkinge priuely
Into þe Gardeine þer he walkeþ soft
And him Salueþ as sche haþ done oft
A maiden childe cam in hire compaignie
Whiche att hir lust maie gouerne and gye

O dere Cosyn myne dan Iohn sche saide
What eyleyþe ȝowe so raþe to rise
Nece quod he hit ouht ynouhe suffise

As ben þes wedded men þat ly and dare

Were al forstrauht wiþ houndes grete and smale
Bot dere nece whi be ȝe so pale

Haþe ȝowe labourde seþen þe niht began
That ȝowe were nede to resten hastelye
And wiþ þat worde he louhe ful merelye
And of owen þouht he wex rede
Þis faire wif gan to sake hire hede
And seide þus ȝe god wote al quod sche
Nay cosyne myne it stant nouht so wiþ me

In al þe reme of fraunce is þere no wif

Dare I nouht tell howe it stant wiþ me
Wherefore I þenke oute of þis londe to wende
Or elles of myselfe to make an ende
So fol am I of drede and of care
This monke began vpon þis wif to stare
And seide alace my nece god forbede
That ȝe for any sorwe or for any drede
ffordo ȝowre self bot telleþ forþe ȝoure greffe  
Paraduenture I maie in ȝoure meschieffe
Counsel or helpe and þerfore telleþ me
All ȝowre annoyȝe for it schall be secre

þatt neuer in my lif for leue ne lothe
Ne schal I of no counsel ȝowe bewreye
The same aȝeine to ȝowe I seye
Be god and be þis portos I swere
Þouhe men wolde me al to peces tere
  
Ne schal I neuere for to go into hell
Bewreye a worde of þinge þat me tell
Not for no Cosinage ne alliance
Bot verreyly for loue and affiance
Thus bue þe sworne and here vpon kist
And ekke of hem tolde oþere what hem lust

As I haue none and namely in þis place

Wiþe myne husbande alþeihe he be ȝoure cosine
Nay quod þis monke be god and be seint Martine

To haue þe mor cause of acqueyntance

In flaundre al beȝonde þe see
Att Poperinge in þe place
His fader was a man ful fre
And lord he was of þat cuntre
As it was goddes grace
Sir Thopas was douhty swayne
White was his face as a peyndemayne

And I ȝowe tell in goode certeyne

And priked as he ware woode

So swette þat men myht him wringe

So fers was his corage

To maken his stede sum solace

That he fonde in a priue wone

And by him baiteþ his dextrere

And it commeþ nowe to my remembrance
Have me excused of myne ignorānce
Y wil beweile in maner of tregedrie

And felle so þat þer was no remedye
To bringe hem out of her aduersite
For certeyne whan þat fortune luste to flye
Þere maie no man of hire þe course wiþholde
    
Beþe war By þis ensample ȝonge and olde
At Lucifer þouhe he an angele were
And nouht a man att him I wil beginne
For þeihe fortōn maie none angel dere
Frome hihe degre ȝit fell he fro his sinne
Doune into hell where as he ȝitte is inne
O lucifer brihtest of aungeles all
Nowe ert þou Sathanas þat maist not twynne
Owte of misery in whiche þou ert fall
Lo Adam in þe felde of Damasene
Wiþ goddes owen fingere wrouht was he
And nouht begeten of mannes sperme vnclene
And welde al Paradise saueinge o tre
Hadd neuer werldly man so hihe degre
As Adam til he for his gouernance
Was dreven oute of his hihe prosperite
To labure and to hell and to muschance

Lo Sampson whiche was annunciate
Be þe Angel longe ar his natiuite
And was god almyhty consecrate
And stode in noblesse whiles he myht see
Was neuer suche anoþer as was he
To speke of strenkeþ and þerto hardinesse
Bott to his wif told he his secre
þoruhe whiche he slouhe him self þoruh wrechednesse
 Sampson þis nobble and myhty champion  
Wiþouten wepe saue his hondes tueye
He slowhe and al torent þe lyon
Toward his weddynge walkinge be þe waie
He false wif couþe him plese and preie
Til sche his counseile knewe and sche vntrewe
Vnto his foos his consel gan bewreye
And him forsoke and toke a noþer newe
 An C foxes to Sampson for ire
And al her tailes he togeder bonde
And sette þe fox tailes al on fire
For he in euery taile hadde putt a bronde
And þei brente al þe cornes in þat lande
And al here Oliues and here vines eke
A þousand men eke he slowhe wiþ his honde
And hadde ne wepen bot an asse cheke
 When þei were sleine so þersted him þat he
Was nyhe lorne for whiche he gan to preie
þat god wolde of his peine sum pite
And send him drinke or elles most he dye
And of þis asse cheke þat was so drye
oute of a wange toþe spron anone a welle
Of whiche he dranke  ynouhe schortly to seie
Thus help him god as Iudicum can telle
  
 Be verrei force att Gasan in a nyhte
Maugre þe felistiens of þat Cite
The gates of þe toune he haþe vp pliht
And on his bakke ykarid hem haþ he
Hihe on hulle wher as men miht se
O noble almyhty sampson leue and dere
þat stronge and noble haþ bue
In al þis werlde ne was þere neuer þi pere
 This Samson neuer siþer dranke ne wyne
Ne on hi hede cam rasure none ne schere
Be precepte of þe Messagier diuine
For al his strenkeþ was in his here
And fully tuenty ȝere be ȝere
He hadde of Israel þe gouernance
Bot after sone schal he wepe mony a tere  
For womman schal bringe him to meschaunce
 Vnto his lemman Dalida he tolde
þat in his heres al his strenkeþ laye
And falsly to his fomen sche him solde
And slepeinge vpon hir berme vpon a daie
Sche maade to clippe or schere his here awaie
And maade his fomen al his craft to spyen
And whan þei him fonde in suche araie
Þei bonde him fast and put oute his eyȝen
Bot er his here was clepped or yschaue
þere was no bonde þat myht him bynde
Bott now is he in prisone put in a kaue
Where as þei maden him att þe queren grinde
O noble Sampson stronkest of mankinde
O whilom Iuge in glorie and richesse
Now maist þou wepe with þine yne blinde
Seþen þou ert fro welþe fal into wrechednesse
  
 The ende of þis caitifs was as I schal seie
His fomen maade a feste vpon a daie
And maden him as her fole toforne him pleie
And þis was  a temple of a grete araie
Bot att þe last he maade a foul affraie
For he tuo postes schoke and maade hem fall
And doune fell þe temple and al þer it laie
And slowe him selfe and eke his fomen all
 This is to seie þe princes euerychon
And eke a þousand bodis was þere sleyne
Wyþ fallinge of þe grete temple of stone
Of Sampson ne wil I no more seyne
Be ware of þis ensample olde and pleyne
þat no man tel her counsel til he wyues
Of suche þinge as þe wolde haue secre feyne
If þat it touche her lymes or her lyues
 Of Ercule þe souereine conqueroure
Syngen his werkes lewde and hihe renonone
For in his time of strengeþ he bare þe floure
He slowhe and raft þe scynne fro þe lyone
He of Centaurus leide þe bost a doune
He arpies slowhe þe cruel birdes fell
He golden apelles raft þe dragoune
He drouhe oute Serberous þe hounde of hell
 He slowhe þe cruel tyrant Buserus
And maade his hors to frete him flesche and bone
He slouhe þe verrey serpent venemous
Of Achilles tuo hornes brak he one
And he slowhe Cacus in a kaue of stone
He slowhe þe Gyant Anteus þe stronge
He slowhe þe Grisely bore and þat anone
And bare þe hede vpon his neke longe
  
Was neuere whihite sen þe werlde began
That slouhe so mony monstres as did he
þoruheoute þis wide werlde his name ranne
What for his streynkeþ and his bounte
And euerye  Realme went he for to see
He was so stronge þat noman miht him lette
Aboue þe werldes ende seiþe trophe
In stede of bondes he a piler sette
 A lemman hadd þis noble champion
þat hiht Dianier frische as maie
And as þe clerkes maade mencione
Sche haþ him sent a schert frische and gaie
Alas þis scherte and walawaie
envenymed was subtily wiþ all
Or þat he had werde it hafe a daie
It maad his flesche fro þe bone fall
 Bo naþelesse sōme clerkes hir excusen
Be one þat hiht nescius þat it Maked
Be as be maye I wil hir nouht accusen
Bon on his bake þis schert he weres al naked
Til þat his flesche was for þe venym blakede
And whan he sauhe none oþer remedye
In hote coles he haþ him self rakede
For wiþ no venym deynede he to deye
 Thus starfe þis worþe myhte ercules  
Lo who maie trust on fortune any þrowe
For him þat foloweþ al þis werlde of pres
Er he bewarre is oft ylaide ful lowe
Ful wyse es he þat him self knowe
Be war for whan þat fortune lust to glose
Than weyteþ sche hir man downe to þroue
Bu suche a weie as he wolde lest suppose

 The myhty trone þe precious tresoure

Wiþ tunge vnneþ maie descriued be
He twyes name iherusalem þe Cite
The vessel of þe temple he wiþ him ladde
Att Babiloyne was his souereigne see
In whiche his glorie and his delyte he had
 þe fairest childern of þe blode Roial
Of iherusalem he dide do gelde anone
And maade eche of hem to bu his clerke
Amonge al oþere Danyel was one
þat was þe wisest childe of euerychone
For he þe dremes of þe kenge expounded
Where as in Caldeie clerk was þere none
þat wist to what fyne his dremes sounded
 This proude kinge lete make a stature of golde
Sexty Cubetes longe and vij in brede
To whiche ymage boþe ȝonge and olde
Commanded he to loute and haue in drede
Or in a forneys ful of flammes rede
He scholde be bernt þat wold not obeie
Bot neuer wolde assent to þat dede
Danyel ne his ȝonge felawes tweye
 This kenge of kinges proude and elate
He wende god þat sitteþ in Mageste
Ne myht him nouht bereue of þat estate
Bot sodanly he lost his dignite
And like a beste him semed for to be
And ete haye as an oxe and leye þere oute
In reyne wiþ wilde bestes walked he  
Til certein time was comme aboute
  
And ylike an egle fethers was his heres
His nayles like birdes clowes were
God releued him a certein ȝeres
And ȝaf him witte and þan wiþ mony a tere
He þonked god and euer his lif in fere
Was he to done amys or more trespas
And or þat time leide was on his bere
He knewe wele þat god was ful of myht and grace
His sone which þat hiht Baltazar
That helde þe regne after his fader daie

For proude he was of herte and of araye
And eke an ydolatre was he aye
His hihe astate assured him in pride
Bot fortune kest adoune and þere he laye
And sodanly his regne gan deuide
A feste he maade vnto his lordes al
vpon a time he maad hem bliþe be
And þan his officers gan he call
Goþe bringeþ forþe þe vesseles quod he
Whiche þat my fader in his prosperite
Owte of þe temple of iherusalem berafte
And to oure hihe goddes þonke we
Of honour þat oure helders wiþ vs lafte

Ay dranken whiles þeire appetite laste
Oute of þis noble vessels sondre wynes
And on a wal þis kinge his yȝe kaste
And sauhe an hand armelesse þat wrote ful fast
For fere of whiche he qwoke and sikked sore
This hand þat baltazar maade so sore agast
Wrote Mane techel phares and no more
  
In al þat londe Magecien was þere none
þat couþe expoune what þis lettre meant
Bot Daniel expound it anone
And seide kynge god to þi fader sent  
Glory and Honour Regne tresoure and rent
And he was proude and no þinge god ne dradde
And þerefore god grete wreche vpon him sent
And him beraft þe Regne þat he hadde
He was oute cast of Mannes compaignye
With asses was his habitacione
And ete hey as a beste in wete and druye
Til þat he knowe be grace and be resone
That god of heuen haþ domynaciōn
Ouere euery Regne and euery creture
And þan hadd god of him compassiōn
And him restored his Regne and his figure
Eke þou þat ert his son is proude also
And knowest al þis þinges priuely
And ert Rebel to god and ert his foo
Thowe dranke eke of his vessels boldely

Dranke of þe same vessels sondre wynes
And heried fals goddes curssely
Therefor to þe schapen grete peine is
This honde was sent fro god þat on the wall

Thyne Reygne is done þou weyest nouht att all
Dyuided is þi regne and it schal be
To medes and to perses ȝeuen quod he
And þilke same nyht þe kinge was slawe
And Darius occupieþ his degre

Lordinges hereby ensamples maie ȝe take
Howe þat in lordeschippe is no sekernesse
For whan fortune wil a man forsake
He bereþ awaye his regne and his Rechesse
And eke his frendes boþ more and lesse
And whan a man haþe frende þoruhe fortune
Mishappe wil make hem ennemys I gesse
This prouerbe is ful soþe and ful comune
CEnobia of Palimere þe quene  
As writen Persiens of hire noblesse

That no wight passed hire in hardinesse

Eft sone and nouht but ones oute of drede

In oþere caas if þat men wiþ hem pleide

And wiþ his legions he toke his weie

As ȝe haue herde and mete and drinke he hadde
    
And þerewiþall it was ful pore and badde
 And one a daie befell þat inne þat oure
Whan þat his mete was wonte to be brouht
The gayler schette þe dores of þe toure
He herde it wele bot he sawe it nouht
And in his hert anone þere fell a þouht
þat þei for hunger wolde done him deyen
Alas quod he alas þat I was wrouht
þerwiþe þe teres fel fro hyȝen
  
 His ȝonge son þat þrei ȝere was of age
vnto him seide fader whi do ȝe wepe
Whan wil þe Gayloure bringen oure potage
Is þere no morsel brede þat ȝe do kepe
I am so hungry þat I maie nouht 
Now wolde god þat I myht slepe euer
þan scholde none hunger in my wombe crepe
þare nys noþinge saue brede þat me were leuere
 þus daie be daye þis childe gan to crie
Til in his fader berme adoune it leye
And seide fader Fare wele I mote deye
And kissed his fader and deyed þe same daye
And whan þe woful fader dede him seye
For woo his arme tuo he gan to bite
And seid alas fortune and walaweye
Þine fals whele my woo I al wite
 His childern wende þat it for hungere was
þat he his arme gnowhe and nout for woo
And seid fader do nouht so alas  
Bot raþer ete þe flesche vpon vs tuo
Oure flesche þou ȝaf vs tak oure flesche vs fro
And ete ynouhe riht þus to him þei seide
And efter þat wiþinne a daie or tuo
þei leide hem doune in his lappe and deyed
 Him self dispeired eke for hunger starf
Þus endede is þe mihte Erle of Pise
Fro hihe a state fortune fro him carf
Of þis tregedrie it ouht Inouhe suffise
Who so wile here it in a longer wise
Reede þe grete Poete of Itaile
That hiht Daunte for he can it deuise
Fro pointe to poynte nouht o worde wil he faile

 Alþouhe þat Nero were as vicious
As fende þat liþe ful lowe adoune
Ȝitte he as telleþ vs swytheneus
þis wide werlde hadde in subieccione
Boþe est and west and septemtrione
Of Rebees safers and of Pereles white
Were al his cloþes brouded vp and doune
For he in Gemmis grete gan delite
 More delicate more Pompus of araie
More proude was neuere Emperoure þan he
þat ilke cloþe þat he hadde wered a daie
After þat time he nold it neuere se
Nettes of gold þrede hadde he grete plente
To fysshe in tybre whan him luste to pleie
His lustes were as lawe in his degre
For fortune as his frende wolde him obeye
 He Rome brent for his delicacie
The Senatours he slowhe vpon a daye
To howe þat men wolde wepe and crye
And slowhe his broþer and by his suster laye
His moder Maade he in pytous araie
For he hir wombe slitte to beholde
Where he conceyved was so walawaye
Þat he so litel of his moder tolde
 No tere oute of his eyen for þat siht
Ne came Bot seide a faire womman was sche
Grete wonder is þat he couþe or miht
Be domeseman of hire dede bewte  
The wyne to bringe commaunde he
And dranke anone none oþere woo he maade
Whan myht is Ioyned vnto cruelte
Alas to depe wil þe venym wade
  
 In ȝouþe a maister hadde þis Emperoure
To teche him letrure and curesye
For of Moralite he was þe floure
As in his time bott if bokes lye
And whiles his maister hadde of him þe maystre
He maade him so konnynge and so souple
þat longe time was or tirannye
Or any vice dorst in him vncouple
 This Seneka of whiche I devise
Because Nero had of him suche drede
For he for vices wold him chastise
Discretely as be worde and nouht be drede
Sire wolde he saie an Emperoure mot nede
Be vertuouse and hate tyrantrye
For whiche he him in baþe maad to blede
On boþe his armes til he most deye
 This Nero hadde eke of a continuance
In ȝouþe aȝeine his maister for to rise
Whiche afterward him þouht a grete grevance
Therefore he maade him deye in þis wyse
Bot naþeles þis Senec þe wise
Chese in a baþþe to deye in þis manere
Raþere þan haue a noþer tormentrie
And þus haþe Nero sleyne his maister dere
 Now fel it so þat fortune lust no longere
The hihe pride of Nero to cherische
ffor þouhe he were stronge ȝitte were sche strenger
Sche þouht þus be god I am to nyce
To sette a man þat is fulfilled of vice
In hihe degre and Emperour him call
Be god oute of his sete I wil him trise
When he leste weneþe sonest schal he fall
  
 Þe Peple rose vpon him vpon a nyht
For his defaute and whan he hadd it aspiede
Oute of his dore anone he haþe him dyht
Alone and þere he wende haue bue alyede
He knokked fast and ay þe more he cryed
The faster schetten þei þe dores all  
Tho wist he wele he had him self begilede
And wente his weie no longere dorst he call
 The peple cried and Rombled vpe and doune
That wiþ his eres herde he howe þei seide
Where is fals terant þis Neroune
For fere almoste out of his witte braide
And to his goddes pitously he seide
For socoure for it myht nouht betide
For drede of þis him þouht þat he deide
And ranne into a gardeyne him to hide
 And in þis cardyne fonde he cherles tueye
And fatten be a fire ful grete and rede
And to þe cherles tuey he gan to preye
To slene him and to girde of his hede
þat to his body whan þat he ware dede
Were no despite ydo for his defame
Him selfe he slouhe he couþe no better rede
Of whiche fortune louhe and had a game
 Was Neuere capitaigne vnder a kinge
That Regnes mo putte in subieccione
Ne strenger was in felde of al þinge
As in his time none gretter in renoune
Ne more Pompose in hihe presumsione
Than Oliferne whiche fortune ay kyste
So lykerously and ledde him vpe and doune
Til þat he heded was er þat he wiste
  
 Nouht onely þat þis werlde hadde of him awe
For leseinge of Richesse and lyberte
Bot he maade euery man Reny his lawe
Nabugodonosor was lord he seide
None oþere god scholde honoured be
Aȝeines his hest no whight dar trespas
Saue in Bethulia a stronge cite
Where Eleachim a preste was of þat place
 Bot take kepe of þe deþe of Oliferne
Amydde his oste he drunke laye a nyht
Wiþinne his tent large as is a berne
And ȝit for al his pompe and al his myhte
Iudithe a womman as he laie vp riht
slepeinge his hede of smote and fro his tente
Ful Priuely sche stale fro euery wyght  
    
 What nedeþ it of kynge Antiocheus
To tel his hihe and Roial Maieste
His hihe pride his werke venymmous
For suche anoþere was neuere none as he
Redeþ whiche þat he was in Macabe
And redeþ þe proude wordes þat he seide
And whie he fel fro his prosperite
And in an hulle howe wrychedly he deyed
 Fortune had him enhaunsed so in pride
þat verraylye he wende he myhte atteygne
vnto þe sterres vpon euery sidde
And in a balance to weye iche mounteyne
And al þe floodes of þe see restreyne
And goddes peple hadde he moste in hate
Hem wolde he sle in torment and peyne
Weneynge þat god myht nouht his pride abate
  
 And for þat Nichamoure and Timothee
Wiþ Iewes were venqwiste mihtile
vnto þe Iewes suche an hatte hadde he
That he hadde greyþed his chare ful hastelye
An swore and seide ful dispitouslye
Vnto Ierusalem wolde he eft sone
To wreke hire on it ful crouellye
Bot of his purpose he was lette ful sone
 God for his manasse him so sore smote
Wiþ innevisible wounde aye vncurable
þat in his guttes karf so and bote
þat his peynes weren importable
And certeinly þe wreche was resonable
For mony mannes guttes dede he peine
Bot fro his purpos cursed and dampnable
For al his smert he nold him nouht restreine
 Bot Badde anone apparellen his Oste
And sodanly or he was of it warre
God daunted al his pride and al his boste
For he so sore fel oute of his chare
þat hurte his limes and his scynne totare
So þat he ne myht go ne Ride
Bot in a chayere men aboute him bare
Al forbrused boþe bakke and side
 The wreche of god him smote so crudelye  
þat in his bode wyked wermes creped
And þerwiþall he stanke so orribily
þat none of al his meyne þat him kepped
Wheþere so þat he woke or elles sleped
Ne myht nouht þe stink of him endure
In þis Meschef he weiled and eke wepped
And knowe god lorde of euery creature
  
 To al his oste and to him self also
Ful wlatesome was þe stinke of þis caren
No man miht him bere to ne fro
And in his stinke and in his orrible peyne
He starf ful wrecchedly in a mownteyne
Thus haþ þis Robboure and þis homicide
That mony a man maade to wepe and pleyne
Suche guerdone as belongeþ vnto pride
The storie of Alexander is so comune
That euery wight þat haþe discrecione
Haþe herd sumwhate or al of his fortune
Þis wilde werlde as in conclusione
He wān be strenkeþ or for his hihe renoune
Thei weren gladde for pes vnto him sende
The pride of man and beste he laide adoune
Wherso he came vnto þe werldes ende
 Comparison myht ȝite neuere be makede
Betuex him and anoþer conqueroure
For al þis werlde for drede of him haþe qwaked
He was of knyhede and of fredome floure
Fortune him maade þe heire of owre honour
Saue wyne and wemmen no þinge miht aswage
His hihe atente in armes and laboure
So was he of loueinge corage
 What pite were it to him þouhe I ȝowe tolde
Of Darius and an C M mo
Of Princes kinges Erles bolde
Whiche he conquered and brouht hem into woo
As fer I saie as man mai ride or goo

For þouhe I write or tolde ȝowe euermo
Of his knyhthode he miht not suffise
  
 Twelue ȝere he regned as seiþe Machabe
Philippus þe sonne of Macedo he was  
That first was kynge of grece þe Contre
O worþi gentil Alisander Alas

Enpoysonde of þi folke þou were
Þin suster fortune haþe torne into an as
And ȝit for þe ne wepped sche neuer a tere
 How schal men ȝeue teres to compleyne
The deþe of gentillesse and of frauncheys
Þat al þe werlde weldede in his demeygne
And ȝit him þouht it myht nouht suffise
So ful was his Corage of hihe emprise
Alace who schal me helpe to endite
Fals fortune and poyson to despise
The whiche tuo of al þes wo I wite
 By wisdom manhede and be labour
Fro humblehede and fro Roial Maieste
Vp rose he Iulius þe conquerour
That al þe Occident be lande and see
Be strenkeþe of hande or elles be trete
And vnto Rome maade hem tributarye
And seþþen of Rome þan Emperoure was he
Til þat fortune wex his aduersarie
 O myht Cesar þat in Thessalye

Of Rome whiche þat flyeþ att þis Batayle

Alas Pompey of þe Orient conqueroure
That fortune vnto suche a deþe brouht
 To Rome aȝeine Repaireþ Iulius
Wiþ his tryumphe laureate ful hihe
Bot on a time Brutus Cassius

Ful priuely had maad conspiracye
Aȝeynes þis Iulius in subtilite wise
And kest þe place in whiche he scholde deye
Wiþ Bodekynnes as I schal ȝowe devise
 This Iulius to þe Capitoile went
vpon a daie as he was wont to goone
And in þe Capitoile anone him hente
This falce Brutus on of his foule fone
And stikked him wiþ Bodekinnes anone
Wiþ mony a wound and þus þe lete him lye
Bot neuere gronte he att no stroke bott one
Or elles att tuo bot if his story lye
 So manly was þis Iulius of hert
And so wele loued estately honeste
þat þouht his dedely woundes so sore smert
His Mantil ouere his hippes cast he
For no man schol se his priuetee
And as he lay in deynge in a trance
And wist verraily þat dede was he
Of honeste ȝit hadde he Remembrance
  
 Lucan to þis story I recommende
And to Sweton and to Valerius also

How þat þes grete Conquerous two

And to be brent men to þe fire him ladde

Þat slouhe þe fire and maade him to eskape

Til fortune on þe galoues maade him gape

And suche a sweuen vpon a nyht he mette
Of whiche he was proude and eke feine

For sche was as it were a manere deye
A gardeyne sche hadde closed al aboute

In whiche sche hadde a kok þat hiht chauntrell
In al þe land of croweinge was his pere

The Osteler answerd him anone
And seide sir ȝoure felawe is gone
  
As sone as dei he went oute of toune
This man gan fal in grete suspeccion
Remembreinge on his dremes þat he mete
And forþe he goþe no longere wolde he let  
Vnto þe west gate of þe toune and fonde
A donge cart as he went to donge þe londe
þat was araide in þe same wyse
As ȝe haue herde þe dede man deuise
And wiþ an hardy hert he gan to crie
Vengeance and Iustice of þis felonye
Myne felawe murdre is þe same nyht
And in þis carte he lieþ gapeinge vpriht

That shulden kepe and rule this citee
Harrow allas hire lith my felaw slayne  
What shuld I more vnto this tale sayne
The peple vp stert and cast the cart to ground
And in the myddil of the dung ther they found
The de man þat murded was al newe
O blisful god þat art so iust and trewe
Lo howe þou bewryest morder al weie
Mordre wil oute þat se we daie be daie
Mordre is so wlatesome and abomynable
To god þat is so Iuste and resonable
þat he ne wil nouht suffre it heled be
þei it abide a ȝere or two or þre
Mordre wil oute þis es myne conclusioune
And riht anone Ministres of þe same toune
And hente þe carter and sore him pynede
And eke the hostelere so ferre engynede
þat þei beknewe here wykkednesse anone
And weren hanged be þe nekke bone
Here maie menne see þat dremes bien to drede
And certes in  same book I rede
Riht in þe next chapetre I rede of þis
I gabbe nouht so haue I Ioye and blis
  

For certeyne cause into a fer Contre
If þat þe wynde ne hadde bue contrarie
þat maade hem in a Cite for to tarye

Bot on a daie aȝeines þe euen tide
The wynde gan chaunge and blew as him lest
Iolif and gladde þei wenten vnto rest
And kesten hem ful erly vnto seile
Bot herken þat o man fel in grete pereile
The tone of hem in slepeinge as he leye
Him mett a wonder dreme aȝeines þe daye
Him þouht a man stode be his side
And him commanded þat he schold abide
And seid him þus if þou to morne wende
þou schalt be dreynte my tale is att an ende
He awoke and told his felawes what he mette
And praide him his viage for to lete  
As for þat daie he praide him to abide
His felawe þat laye be his beddes side
Gan for to lauhe and scorned him ful fast
No dreme quod he maie myne herte agaste
þat I wil lette for to do my þinges
I sett nouht a strawe be dremeinges
For swevens bien bot vanytees and Iapes
Menne dreme alweie of owles and of apes
And of mony a mase þere wiþ all
Men dremen of þinge þat neuer was ne schall
Bott seþen I see þat þou wilte here abide
And þus forslewþen willfully þe tide
God wote it reweþ me and haue good daie
And þus he toke his leue and went his waie
And er þat he hadde halfe his cours ysailed
I note whie ne whatt meschaunce it eylede
Bot Casuelly þe schip bothome torentte
And schip and man vnder þe water wente
  
In siht of oþere schippes hem beside
þat wiþ him sailed att þe same tide
And þerfore he seide pertelote so dere
Bu suche ensamples olde maist þou lere
þat noman schold bue to recheles
Of dremes for I saie þe doubteles
þat mony a dreme ful sore is for to drede
 Lo in þe lif of seint kenelme I rede
þat was kenulphes son þe noble kinge
Of Mercenrike howe Kenelme mette a þinge
A litel ar he was murdred on a daie
His murdre in his avisione he seyhe
His norice him expounded euery dele
His sweuen and bad him for to kep him wele
For traison bot he was vij ȝere olde
And þerefore litel tale haþe he tolde
Of ony dreme so holy was myn herte
Be god I hadde leuer þan my scherte

Dame pertelote I saie ȝow trewlye
Macrobeus þat write þe avisioun
In Affike of þe worþe Cyprioun
Affermeþ dremes and seiþ þat þere biene
Warneynge of þinges þat men after seen ·  
And forþermore I praie ȝowe lokeþ wele
The olde testament of Danyele
If he helde dremes of any vanyte
Rede eke of Ioseph and þan schal ȝe see
Wheþer dremes bien sumtyme I seye nouht all
Warneynge of þinges þat schal after fall
 Loke of Egipte þe kinge dan Pharaho

Where þei ne felte none effect in dremes
Who so wolle seche þe actes of sundre Realmes
Maie rede of dremes mony a worder þinge
Loo cresus whiche þat was of Lidde kinge
  
Met he nouht þat he sat vpon a tre
Whiche signified he scholde an hanged bue
Lo here Adromacha Ectores wyfe

Sche dremed on þe same nyht beforne
Howe þat þe lif of Ector schold be lorne
If þilke daye he wente into Bataile
Sche warned him bot it myht not availe
He went for to feyhten neuere þe lese
Bot he was sleyne of Achilles
Bot þilke tale is al to longe to tell
And eke it is nyhe daie I may duell
Schortly I seie as for conclusione
þat I schal ha of þis avisione
Of aduersitees and I saie forþere more

For þei biene venemous I wote riht wele
I hem defy I loue hem neuere a dele
Now lat vs speke of merþe and stinte al þis
Madame Pertelot so haue I blisse
Of o þinge god haþe me sent large grace
For whan I se þe beaute of ȝoure face
Ȝe bien so scarlete rede aboute ȝoure eyȝen
It makeþe al my drede for to deyen
For as so seker as in principio
Mulier est hominis confusio
Madame þe sentence of þis latine is
Womman is mannes Ioye and al his blisse
For whan I fele a nyht ȝoure soft side
Al be it þat  maie nouht on ȝoure ride  
For þat oure perche is maade so narwe alas
I am so ful of Ioye and solace
þat I defy boþe sweuen and dreme
And wiþ þat worde he flieþ doune fro þe beme
For it was daie and eke his hennes all
And wiþ a chokke he gan hem for to call
  
For he had fonden a corne laie in þe ȝerde
Royal he was no more aferde
He feþerde pertelode tuente time
And trade hire as oft ar it were prime
He lokeþ as it were a grime lyone
And on his toos he Romed vp and doune
Him deynede noȝt to sett his feet on grounde
Aie chokked he whan he hadde a corne yfounde
And to him þan ran his wyves all
Thus Roial as a prince in his halle
Leue I þis chaunteclere in his pasture
And after wil I tel of his aduenture
 Whan þe moneþ in whiche þe werlde beganne
þat hiht Marche whan god first maad manne
Was complete and passed where also
Seþen Marche began xxx daies and tuo
Befel þat Chaunteclere in his pride

Kest vp his hiȝen to þe briht sone

þrette degrees and one and sumwhat more
He knewe be kinde and be none oþere lore

Madame pertelote Mi werldes blisse
Herken howe þes blisful birdes singe
And see þe frische flowres how þei springe
Ful is myne herte of reuel and solas
Bott sodanly him fel a sorweful cas
For euere þe later ende of Ioye is sone ago
And comunly oft time it falleþ so
And if a Rethor couþe faire endite

As for a souereyne notabilite
Nowe euerey wiseman herken me    
This storie is as trewe I vndertake
As is þe booke of lancelote þe lake
That wemmen helde in ful grete Reuerence
Nowe wil I turne aȝeine to my sentence
A kole fox ful of sleihte and iniquite

Be hihe ymaginacion aforne ykast
The same niht þorwheoute þe hegges brast
Into þe ȝerde þer chaunteclere þe faire
Was wonte and eke his wif to repaire
And in a bedde of wortes stil he laye
Til it was passed vndern of þe daye
Wayteinge his time on chaunteclere to fall
As gladly done þes homicides all
Þat in awaite ligge to murdre men
O fals Mordroure roukeinge in þi den

That brouhtest troye al vtterly to sorwe
O chaunteclere acursed be þat morwe

Bot þat at god afor wote it mote nedes be
After opinione of certeine clerkes
Witnesse on him þat any clerke es

In þis matier and grete disputacioun
And haþe bue of an hundreþ þousand men
But I ne can bult it to þe branne

Or of his weteinge streyneþ neuere a dele

Mi tale is of a koke as ȝe maie here  
That toke his counsel of his wif with sorwe
To walken in þe ȝerde vpon þe morwe

Wemmen counsel bien ful often colde
Wemmen counsel brouht vs first to woo
And maade Adam fro paradise to go

Bot for I note whome I miht  it displese
If I counsel of wemmen wolde blame
Passe ouere for I said it in my game
Rede Auctors where þei trete of suche matier
And what þei seine of wemmen hier

Faire in þe sande to baþe hire merilye

Aȝeine þe sunne and chaunteclere so fre
Sange merier þat þe meri meremaide in þe see
For Phisiologus seiþe witterly
How þat þei singen wele and merely
And so befell as he kest his yȝe
Amonges þe wortes vpon a butterflye
He was ware of þis fox þat ley ful lowe
Noþinge lust him þan to crowe
Bot cride anone kok kok and vp he sterte
As a man was affraide in his herte
For naturaly a beste desireþ to flee
Fro his contrarie whan he maie it see
Þeihe he neuere hadde seen it erst wiþ his ye

Sayde gentil sire alas what will ȝe done
Bene ȝe affraide of me þat am ȝoure frende
Certes sire þat bien ȝe vnhende

For trewly  ȝe haue as mery a steuene
As an Angel haþe þat is in heuene

Min lorde ȝoure fader god his soule blisse
And eke ȝoure moder of his gentillese

And certes sir ful feine wold I ȝowe plese
Bot for men spekeþ of singeinge 
So mote I broke myn yen tweie
Sauf ye I ne herd neuyr man so syng  
As dide ȝoure fader in þe morneinge
Certes it was of hert al þat he sange
And for to make his voice þe more strange
He wolde so peyne him þat wiþ boþ his yȝen
He nost wynke so loude he dide criene
And stond on his tiptos þere wiþ al
And strecche forþe his nekke longe and smal
And eke he was of suche discrecione

I haue wele redde Dan Burnel þe asse
Amonge his vers þere was a kok
For a prestes sonne ȝaue him a knoke
Vpon his legges whan he was ȝonge and nyce
He maade him for to lese his benefice
Bot certeine þere is no comparisoun
Betuyx þe wisdome and discresioun
  
Of ȝoure fader and his subtilite
Nowe singeþ sire for seint charite
Lete se con ȝe ȝoure fader counterfet
This Chaunteclere his wynges gan to bete
As man þat couþe his treson nouht aspie
So was he Rauysched wiþ his flaterie
Alas ȝe lordes mony a fals flaterer
Is in ȝoure courte and mony a losengier

þan he þat soþefastnesse vnto ȝowe seiþ
Redeþ Ecclesiastre of flatre
Be war ȝe lordes of here trecherie
This Chaunteclere stode hihe vpon his toos
Strecheinge his nekke and held his yen cloos
And gan to crowe loude for þe nones
And Dan Russell stert vp al at ones
And by þe gorge hente chaunteclere
And on his bak towarde þe woode him bere
  For ȝitt was þere noman him sewed
O destanye þat maiste not bu enchewed
Alas þat chaunteclere fel þo fro þe beme
Alas his wif ne rouht nouht of dremes
And on a fridaye fel al þis meschaunce
O venus þat is goddes of plesaunce
Seþes þat þi seruant was þus chaunteclere
And  þi seruice dide al his powere
More for delite þan þe werlde to multiplie
Whi woldest þou suffur on þi daye to deye
O gaufride dere maister souereigne
Than whan þi worþi kinge Richard was sleyne
Wiþ schotte compleigned his deþ so sore
Whi ne hadd I nowe þi sentence and þi lore

For on a fryday schortly sleyne was he

For chaunteclere and for his peyne
  
Certes suche crie ne lamentacione
Was of ladies maade whan þat Elyone
Was wonne and pirrus wiþ his streiht swerde
Whan he hente kinge Prian be þe berde
And sleyne him as seide Eneydos

And þat þe Romeynes hadde bernt Cartage
Sche was so ful of tourment and of rage

And bernede her self wiþ a stedfast hert
O  woful hennes riht so cride ȝe
As whan þat nero berned þe Cite
Of Rome Criden þe Senatours wifes
For þat her husbondes scholde lese here lyves

Now wil I turne to my tale aȝeine

And sawe þe fox towarde þe groue gone  
And bare vpon his bakke þe koke awaie

Of brasse þei brouht bemes and of box
Of horne and bone in whiche þei poped

Nowe good men I preie ȝowe herkeneþ al

And  he spak þat worde al sodanly

And hihe vpon a tree he flyȝe anone
And þe fox sawe þat he was goone
Alas quod he o chaunteclere alas

Þat is so vndiscrete of gouernaunce

Lo suche it is to bue recheles
And necligent and trusteþ on flaterye
Bot ȝe þat halde þis tale a folye

And þat is whan men pley wiþ a strawe
And wiþ þis speke þe koce wex al wrawe
And on þe Manciple gan he nodde fast
For lak of speche and doune þe hors him cast
Where as he laye til men him vp toke
This was þe faire cheuache of a coke
Alas he ne hadd hold him be his ladel
And er þat he aȝeine were in his sadel
þere was grete schoueinge to and fro
To lift him vp and muche care and woo
So vnwelde was þi cely palled gost
And to þe Mancyple þan spak oure Ost
Be cause þat drinke haþe dominacione

And fneseþ fast and eke he haþe þe pose

To kepen him and his capel oute of þe slowhe
And if he fal fro his Capel eft sone
Þān schal we al haue  ynouhe to done
In liftynge vp his hevy dronken cors
Tel on þi tale  of him maake I no force
Bot ȝitte Maunciple in feiþe þou ert to nyce
Thus openly to reproue him of his vice
Anoþere daie he wil peraduenture
Recleyme þe and bringe þe to luyre
I mene he speke will of smale þinges
And for to speke att þine rekenynges

No quod þe Manciple þat were a grete meschef
So myht he bringe me in to þe snare
Ȝit hadde I leuer pay  for þe Mare
Whiche he rideþ on þan he schold wiþ me strive
I wil nouht wreþþe him so mot I þriue

And wyte ȝe wele þat I haue here in a gourde
A drauht of wyne  ȝe of a rype grape
And riht anone ȝe scholne se a good Iape
This koce schal drink þerof if I maye
Vpon peine of my lif he wil not sey neye
And certanly to tellen as it was
Of þis vessel þe koce drank fast alas
Whate nedeþ it he dranke  ynowhe aforne
And whan he had poped in his horne
And to þe manciple he toke þe gourde aȝeine
And of þat drink þe koc was wonder feyne
And þonked him in suche wise as he couþe
þan gan oure oste waxen wonder louþe
And seide I see wele it is necessarie
Wher þat we gone drinke wiþ vs to carye
  
For þat wil torne Rankoure and disese
To accord and loue and mony worde to pese
O Bachus blissed be þin name

Worschipe and þonke be to þi deite
Of þat Matier gete ȝe no more of me
Tel on þou Manciple I þe preie
Sires quod he nowe herkeneþ what I seye
WHan phebus dwelled here in þis erþe adoune
As olde bokes makeþ mencioune
He was þe most lusti bacheller
Of al þis werlde and eke þe best archer
He slowe phiton þe serpent as he leye
Slepeinge aȝeine sonne vpon a daie
And mony anoþere worþe noble dede
He wiþ his bowe brouht as men mowe rede
Pleynge he couþe of euery mynstralcye
And singen þat it was a melodye
To heren of his clere voice þe soune
Certes þe kinge of Thebes amphione
þat wiþ his singeinge walled þat Cite
Couþe neuer singen half so wele as he
Therto he was þe semelest man
þat is or was seþþe þe werlde beganne
Whatt nedeþ it his fetures for to discryue
For in þis werld was none so faire on lyue
He was þerwiþ fulfilled of gentillesse
Of honour and of parfite worþinesse
þis Phebus þat was floure ob Bachellarie
As wele in fredam as in Cheualrye
For disport in signe eke of victorie
Of Pheton so as telleþ vs þe storie
Was worþi to beren in his honde a bowe
Now hadde þis Phebus in his hous a crowe
Whiche in cage he fostred moni a daie
And tauht it speke as men techeþ a iaie
  
White was þis crowe as is a snowe white swanne
And counterfede þe speche of euery manne
He couþe whān he schold tel a tale
þere wiþ in al þis werlde no nyhtinggale
Ne couþe be an hundreþ þousand dele
Singen so wonderli mery and wele
Nowe hadde þis Phebus in his hous a wif  
Whiche þat he loued more þan his owen lif
And nyht and daie dide euer his diligence
Hire for to plese and done hire reuerence
Saue onely if þe soþe þat I schal seye
Ielowse he was and wolde haue kepped hire feyne
For him were loþe Iaped for to be
And so euery whiht in suche degre
Bot al for nouht for it availeþ nouht
A good wif þat is clene of werke and þouht
Schold not be kepped in none awaite certeine
And trewly þe labour is in veyne
To kepe a schrewe for it wil nouht be
þis holde I for a verraie nycete
To spill a labour for to kepe wives
Thus writen olde clerkes in her lyues
Bot nowe to purpos as I first began
þis worþi phebus doþ al þat he can
To plesen hire weneinge be suche plesance
And for his manhode and his gouernance
þat noman schold haue put him fro hire grace
Bot god it wote þer maie noman enbrace
As to discryue a þinge whiche þat nature
Haþe naturelly sette in a creature
Tak any birde and put it in a kage
And do al þine entente and þi Corage
To foster it tendurli wiþ mete and drinke
Of al Deynteþes þou canst beþinke
And kepe it as clenly as þou maie
Alþouhe his cage of golde be neuere so gaie
  
Ȝit haþ þis berde be twenti þousande folde
Leuer in a forest þat is wilde and colde
gone ete wermes and suche wrechednesse
For euer þis birde wil done his besinesse
To ascape oute of his cage whan he maie
His liberte þe birde desireþ aie
Lat take a katte and foster him wele wiþ melke
And tendre flessche and make his couche of selke
And late him sene a mouse go by þe wall
And anone he weyueþ melke flesche and all
And euery deynte þat is in þat house
Suche appetite haþ he to ete a mouse
Lo he haþ lust his dampnacione
And appetite flemeþ discrecione  
As þe wolfe haþe also a veleyns kinde
þe lewdest wolf þat sche maie finde
Or lewedest of Reputacione þat will sche take
In time whan hir list to haue a maake
Al þes ensamples speke I be þis men
þat bien vntrewe and no þinge be wemmen
For men haue euere a lykerous appetite
On lower þink to performe her delite
þan on here wives bien þei neuer so faire
Ne neuere so trewe ne so debonaire
Flesche is so new fangul wiþ meschance
That we ne kunne in noþinge haue plesaunce
þat sownet in to vertew any while
This Phebus whiche þat þouht vpon no gile
Deceyved was for al his Iolyte
For under him a noþere hadde sche
A man of litel Reputacione
Not worþe to Phebus in comparaciōne
þe more harme is it happeþe oft soo
Of whiche þere commeþ muche harme and wo
And so befel whan Phebus was absent
His wif anone haþ for hire lemman sent
  
Here lemman sertes þis is a knauysche speche
Forȝeuen it me and þat I ȝow beseche
The wise plauto seiþ as ȝe maie rede
The worde mot nede accorde wiþ þe dede
If men schal tel properly a þinge
The worde mot Cosine be to þe worcheinge
I am a bustuse man riht þus seie I
There is no difference treuly
Betwex a wif þat is of hihe degre
If of hir body dishonest sche be
And a pouerer wenche oþere þan þis
If it so be þei werken boþe amys
Botte þat þe gentil is in astate aboue
Sche schal be cleped his ladi as in loue
And for þat toþer is a puere womman
Sche schal be cleped his wenche or his lemman
And god it woote myne owen dere broþere
Men leyþe þe tone as lowe as lyþe þat oþere
Riht so betwyx a titles tirānt
And an owtelawe and a þefe errant  
þe sam I seie þere is no difference
To Alisander was tolde þis sentence
þat for þe terant is of gretter myht
Be fors of meyne to sle doune riht
And birne hous and home and maken al pleyne
Lo þerefore he is clepe a Capiteigne
And for þe outelawe haþe bot smal menȝe
And may nouht do so grete an harme as he
Ne bringe a contre to so grete meschefe
Men klepen him an outelawe or elles an þef
Bot for I am a man not texed wele
I wil note tel of titus neuer a dele
I wil go to my tale as I beganne
Whan Phebus wif hadde sent for hir lemman
Anone þei wrouht al her lust volage
þis white crowe þat honge aye in þe cage
  
Behelde her werke and seide neuere a worde
And whan þat home was commen phebus þe lorde
This Crowe sange kokkow kokkowe cokkowe
What birde quod Phebus what songe singes þou
Ne were þow wonte so merilye to singe
þat to myne herte it was a reioysinge
To here þi voice alace what songe is þis
Be god quod he I singe nouht amys
Phebus quod he for al þi worþinesse
For al þi beute and þi gentillesse
For al þi songe and al þi Minstralcye
For al þi wayteinge blered is þine eye
Wiþ one of luytel reputacion
Nouht worþ to þe as in comparison
The mountance of a gnate so mot  priue
For on þi bedde þi wif I sawe him swyue
What wile ȝe more þe crowe anone him tolde
Be sadde tokenes and be wordes bolde
Howe þat his wif hadde done her lycherie
Him to grete schame and to grete velanye
And tolde him oft he sawe it wiþ his eyȝen
This Phebus gan awaiwarde for to wrien
Him þouht his sorweful herte a brast in tuo
His bowe he bente and sette þerinne a floo
And in his Ire þan haþe he his wif sleyne
This es þe effecte þere is nomore to seine  
For sorwe of whiche he brak his mynstralcy
Bothe harpe and Lute getern and sautrie
And eke he brak his arwes and his bowe
And after þat þus spake he to þe crowe
Traytour quod he wiþ tonge of scorpione
þou hast me brouht to my confusione
Alas þat I was wrouht whi nere I dede
O dere wif o Iemme of lustihede
That were to me so sadde and eke so trewe
Nowe liest þou dede wiþ face pale of hewe
  
Ful giltles þat dorst  swere Iwys
O rachel hounde to done so foule amys
O trouble witte o yre recheles

O wanne trust ful of fals suspeccion
Where was þi witte and þi discrecione
Of euery mair be war of rechelnesse
Ne trowe no þinge wiþ outen stronge wittenesse
Smyte nouhte to sone ar þat þou wyt why
Ande be auisede wele and soburlye
Or ȝe do any execucion
Vpon ȝoure ire for suspecciōn
Alas a þousand folke haue Rachel ire
Fully fordone or brouht hem in þe myre
Alas for sorwe I wil my self sle
And to þe crowe o fals þef seide he
I wil þe qwite anone þi fals tale

Nowe schalt þou fals þef þi songe forgone
Eke þine white feþers euerychon
Ne neuer in al þi lif schal þu speke
þus schal men on a traitur buen ywreke
þou and þin hofspringe euere schal be blake
Ne neuere swete noise schal ȝe maake
Bot euere Crie aȝeine tempest and reyne
In tokeneynge þat þoruhe þe my wif is sleyne
And to þe crowe he sterte and þat anone
And pullede his white feþers euerychone
And maad him blake and raft him al his songe
And eke his speche and oute at þe dore him slonge
Vnto þe deuel whiche I him betake
And for þis cas bene al crowes blake  
Lordeinges be þis ensample I ȝowe preye
Beþe ware and takeþ kepe what þat ȝe seye
Ne telleþ neuere no man in ȝoure lif
Howe þat anoþere man haþ swyved his wif

But be my trouthe if thou were seculere
Thow woldeste bene a tredefoul a right

See whiche braunnes hath  gentel preeste

Hym nedeth nat his colour for to dyen

Now sire faire falle yow for youre tale
And aftir he with full mery chere
Saide vnto a nother as ye shulle here

Now late vs turne ageyne to Ianuarye
That in this gardyn with this faire Maye
Syngeth full merier than the Popyniaye
You loue I best and schall and other non
So longe aboute the aleis is he gon
Till he was come ageyns thilke pirye
Wher as this Damyan sitteth full merye
On high among the fresche leues grene
This fresche May that is so bright and schene
Gan for to sike and seide allas my side
Now sir quod sche for ought that may betide
I moste haue of the peris that I se
Or I mote dye so sore longeth me
To etyn of the smale peris grene
Help for hir loue that is of heuene quene
I tell you well a woman in my plight
May haue to fruyt so gret an appetight
That sche may dyen but sche it haue
Allas quod he that I ne had here a knaue
That couthe clymbe allas allas quod he
ffor I am blynde ye sir no fors quod sche
But wolde ye vouche saf for goddis sake
The piry in with your armes take
ffor well I wot that ye mestruste me  
Than schulde I clymbe well ynowȝ quod sche
So I my foot myght set vpon your bak
fforsothe seide he in me schall be no lak
Might I you helpe with myn herte blood
He stoupith doun and on his bak sche stood
And caught hir bi a twiste and vp sche goth
Ladies I pray you that ye be not wroth
I can not glose I am a rude man
And sodenly anon this Damyan
  
Gan pullen vp the smok and yn he throng
 A gret tente he þrest yn  a long
Sche seide it was þe meriest fit
That euyr in hir lyue sche was at yit
Mi lordis tente sche seide serueþ me not þus
He foldith twifolde bi swete Ihesus
He maie not swyue worth a leke
And yet he is fulle gentille  fulle meke
This is leuyr to me than Euensong
And whan that Pluto saugh this gret wrong
To Ianuarye he yaf his sight agayne

And whan he thus had caght his sighte agayn  
Ne was ther neuyr man of thyng so fayne
But on his wife his thought was euyr mo
Vp to the tre he kest his yȝen two
And sigh that Damyan his wife had dressed
In whiche maner it may not ben expressed
But if I wolde speke vncurteisly
And vp he yaf a roryng and a cry
As doth the modir when the childe schall dye
Out help allas harrow he gan crye
O strong lady stoure what dost thou
And sche answerith sir what eileth you
Haue paciens and reson in your mynde
I haue you holpen on bothe your yȝen blynde
Vp perill of my soule I schall not lyen
As me was taught to hele with your yȝen
Was no thyng bet for to make you se
Than strougle with a man vp on a tre
God woot I dide it in full good entente
Strogle quod he ye algate yn it wente
God yeue you bothe on schames deth to dien
He swyued the I saugh it with myn yen
And ellis be I hangid bi the hals
Than is quod sche the medicyn fals
ffor certeynly if that ye myghtyn se
Ye wolde not say tho wordis vnto me
Ye han som glymsyng and no perfit sight
I se quod he as well as euyr I myght
Thanked be god with bothe myn yȝen two
And be my trouthe me thought he dide the so
Ye mase mase good sir  quod sche
this thank  haue I for I haue made you se
  
Allas quod sche that euyr I was so kynde
Now dame quod he let all passe out of mynde
Come doun my leef and if I haue myssaide
God helpe me so as I am euyll apaide  
But be my fadir soule I wende haue seyne
How that this Damyan had bi the leyne
And that thi smok had leyne vp on thi brest
Ye sir quod sche ye may wene as you lest
But sir a man that waketh out of his slepe
He may not sodenly well take kepe
Vp on a thyng ne seen it parfitly
Till that he be a dawe verraily
Right so a man that long hath blynde be
Ne may not sodenly so well se
ffirst whan the sight is newe comen ageyne
As he that hath a day or two seyne
Till that your sight stablid be a while
Ther may full many a sight you begile
Beth ware I pray you for bi heuen kyng
ffull many a man weneth for to se a thyng
And it is all another than it semeth
He that mys conceyueth mys demeth
And with that word sche leep doun fro the tre
This Ianuarye who is glad but he
He kisseth hir and clippeth hir full ofte
And on hir wombe he strokith hir full softe
And to his paleis hoom he hath hir lad
Now good men I pray you to be glad
Thus endith here my tale of Ianuarye

In wommen bene  for ay as besy as bees
Ben they  vs secly men to disceyve
And from the soth  evir wol they weyve
By this Marchauntis tale  it preveth weell
But doutles  as true as any steel
I haue a wyf  though she pore be
But of hir tong  a labbyng shrewe is she
And yit she hath  an heepe of vices mo
Therof no fors  lat alle such thingis go
But wot ye what  in counsail be it said
Me reweth soore  that y am to hir teyde
ffor and y shulde rekne  euery vice
Which that she hath  ywys y were nyce
And cause why  it sholde reported be
And tolde to hir  of som of this menie
Of hom it nedith nat  for to declare  
Syn wommen  can vttir suche chaffare
And eek my wyt  suffiseth nat therto

We weddede Men lyue in sorrowe and care

As that ye ben  fy on possession
But yf a man  be vertuous wythall

But for to pleye at Dyse  and spende
And lese all that he hath  is his vsage
And he had lever  talkyn with a page
