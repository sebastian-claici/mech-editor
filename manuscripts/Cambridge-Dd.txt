WHan that Aprill with his shoures soote  
The draught of Marche hath pershed þe roote
And bathed euery veyn in swhiche licour
Of soche vertue engendred is þe floure
And ȝepherus eke with his swete breth
Enspired hath in euery holt and heth
The tendre croppes and the yonge son
Hath in the Ram half his cours ron
And smale foules make melody
That slepe all night with open Ie
So prekketh hem nature in hir corage
Than longeth yt folk to go on pilgremage
And Palmers for to seche straunge strondes
To ferne halowes couthe in sondry londes
And specially from euery shires ende
Of Engelond to Caunterbury þei wende
The holy blisful martir for to seke
That hem hath holp when they were seke
So byfyll yt þat seson on a day
In southwerk at þe Tabard as I lay
Redy to wende on my pilgremage
To Caunterbury with full deuou corage
That night was com in to our hostry
Wele xxix in a cumpany
Of diuers folk by auenture yfall
In felyshipe and pilgrymes were they all
And toward Caunterbury wold þei ryde


The chambres and stables weren wyde
And wele were we esed at the best
And shortly when þe son went to rest
So hade I spoke with hem euerychone
That I was of her felyshippe anone
And made foreward erly to aryse
To take our wey as I shall you deuise
But neuertheless while I haue tyme and space
Er þat I in þis tale ferther pace
Me thinketh yt accordyng were to reson
To telle you all the condicon
Of ecch of hem so as it semeth me
And whiche they were and of what degre
And eke of what array þei were in  
And at a knight þan woll I ferst begynne
A Knight þere was and þat a worthy man
þat fro þe tyme þat he first began
To ryde out he loued chiualrye
Trewth honour fredome and curtesye
And thereto hade he ryden no man so ferre
ffull worthy was he in his lordes werre
As wele in cristendome as in hethnesse
And euer honour for his worthynesse
At alisaundre he was  whan it was won
ffull often tymes hade he  the boorde bygon
Aboue all nacions  in Spruce
In lettow hade he be and in Ruce
No cristen man so oft in his degre
In Garnard eke at the sege hade he be
In Algaryse and rydyn in Belmary
At Lyaies hade he be and at Sataly
When they were wonne and in þe grete se
At many a noble aryve hade he bee
At mortaill batailles hade he be xv
And fought for our feith at Tramyssene
Within þe lyestes iij· and ay sleyn his fo


This ilk worthy knight hade be also
Somtyme with the lord of Palacye
Ageyns an other hethen in Turkye
And euermore he hade a soueraigne pryse
And though he were worthy he was wyse
And of his port as meke as a meide
He neuer yit no velany seide
In all his lyf vnto no manere wyght
He was a verrey perfite gentell knight
And for to telle you of his array
his hors was gode but him self was nat gay
Of fustyan he wered a gepon
All besmotered with his habergeon
ffor he was late come fro his viage
And went to do his pilgremage
With hym þere was his son a yong squyer
A lovier and a lusty bacheler
With lokkes crull as they were leyde in presse  
Of xx yere of age he was as I gesse
Of his stature he was of even lengthe
And wonderly deliuere and grete of strengthe
And he hade be somtyme in chiuache
In flaundres Artoys and in pycarde
And born hym wele as of his litell space
In hope to stonde in his lady grace
Embrouded was he as yt were a mede
All full of fressh floures white and rede
Syngyng he was or floytyng all the day
He was as fressh as ys the monthe of May
Short was his goun with sleves longe and wyde
Wele coude he sit an hors and feire ride
he coude eke songes make and wele endite
Iuste and daunce portray and eke write
And so hote he loued þat by nyghtertale
He slepe no more þan doth the nyghtyngale
Curteys he was lowly and seruisable


He carf byfore his fadre at the table
Ayoman hade he and seruauntes nomo
At þat tyme for hym lyst to ryde so
And was all cladde in cote and hode of grene
A sheef of pecok arowes bryght and shene
vndre his belt he bare full thriftyly
Wele coude he dresse his takle and yomanly
His arowes drouped nat with fedres lowe
And in his hande he bare a myghty bowe
A not hede he hade with a broun visage
Of wode craft wele koude he all þe vsage
Vpon his arme he bare a gay braccre
And by his syde a swerde and a bokelere
And on þat other syde a gay daggere
Harnest wele as sharpe as pointe of spere
A christofre on his brest of silver shene
An horn he bare · þe baudryk was of grene
A foster he was sothly as I gesse
There was also a nonne a prioresse
That of hir smylyng was full symple and coy
hir grettest othe was but by seint Loy
And she was cleped madame Eglentyne  
ffull wele she song the seruice devyne
Entuned in hir voyse full semely
And frensh she spake feire and fetysly
After þe scole of Stratford at þe bowe
ffor frensh of Parys was to hir vnknowe
At þe mete wele taught was she with all
She lete no morsell fro hir lyppes falle
Ne wet hir fyngers in hir sauce depe
Wele koude she cary a morsell and wele kepe
That no droppe ne fell vp on hir brest
In curtesye was set full moche hir lest
Hir ouerlyppe wyped she so clene
That in hir cuppe þere was no ferthing sene
Of grece and whan she hade dronke hir draught


ffull semly after hir mete she raught
And sekerly she was of grete disport
And full plesaunt and amiable of port
And peined hir to countrefeit chere
Of court for to be statelyche of manere
And for to be holde digne of reuerence
And for to speke of hir conscience
She was so charitable and pitous
She wold wepe yf þat she saw a mous
Caught in a trap yf þat it were dede or bled
Of smale houndes hade she þat she fedde
With rosted flessh or mylk and wastell brede
But sore wepte she yf ony of hem were dede
Or yf men smote it with yerde smerte
And all was conscience and tendre herte
ffull semely hir wymple pynched was
Hir nose tretise hir yen grey as glas
Hir mouthe full small and þerto softe and rede
But sekerly she hade a feire forehede
ffor hardely she was nat vndregrowe
It was almost a span brede I trowe
ffull fetyse was hir cloke as I was ware
Of small corall about hir arme she bare
A peire of bedes gauded all with grene
And þereon hyng a broche of gold full shene
On which was first write a crowned A  
And after amor vincit omnia
An other nonne with hir hade she
That was hir Chapelyn and prestes iij
A monke þere was a feire for þe maistry
An outryder þat loued venery
A manly man to be an Abbot able
ffor many a deinty hors hade he in his stable
And whan he rode men myght his bridell here
Gyngelyng in a whistelyng wynde as clere
And eke as loude as doth þe Chapell bell


There as the lord was keper of þe sell
The rewle of seint Maure or of seint Benet
Bycause it was olde and somdele streyt
This ilk monke lete olde thinges passe
And helde after þe newe world his space
He gaue nat at þat tixt a pulled hen
That seith þat honnters be nat holy men
Ne þat a monke whan he is recheles
Ys lykned to a fyssh þat is waterles
This is to seyn a monke out of his cloystre
But þat tixt helde I nought worth an oystre
And I seide his oppenyon was gode
What shold he stody and make hym self wode
Vpon a boke in Cloystre all wey to pore
Or swynke with his hondes and labore
As Austyn bit ya how shall þe world be serued
Lete Austyn haue his swynk to hym reserued
Þerfore he was a prykasour aryght
Greyhoundes he hade as swyft as foule of flyght
On prekyng and huntyng for the hare
Was all his lust for no thing wold he spare
I sawe his sleves purfyled at þe hande
With gryse and þat þe fynest of a londe
And for to festyn his hode vndre his chyn
He hade of gold wrought a full coryous pyn
A loue knot in þe gretter ende þere was
His hede was balled þat shone as ony glas
And eke his face as he hade ben anoynte
He was a lord full fat and in good poynte
His yen stepe were and rollyng in his hede  
That stemed as a fourneys of a lede
His botes souple his hors in grete state
Now certeinly he was a feire prelate
He was nought pale as a forpyned gost
A fat swan loved he best of any rost
His palfray was as broun as a bery


Afrere þere was a wanton and a mery
A lymytour and a full solempne man
In þe orders iiij · ys non so wele þat can
So moche of daliaunce and feire langage
He hade made full many a feire mariage
Of yong wommen at his owen coste
Vnto his ordre he was a noble poste
ffull wele beloved and famuler was he
with fraunkleyns ouer all in his contre
And with worthy wommen of þe toun
ffor he hadde power of confession
    
    
ffor swetely herde he confession
And plesaunt was his absolucon
he was an esy man to yeve penaunce
There as he wist to haue a gode petaunce
ffor vnto a poure ordre for to geve
Ys syngne þat a man ys wele shreve
ffor yf he gaf he durst make auaunt
He wist þat a man was repentaunt
ffor many a man so herde ys of his hert
He may nought wepe all þough hym sore smert
Therfore instede of penaunce and prayers
Men most yeve silver to þe poure freres
His typpet  was ay farsed full of knyves
And pynnes for to yeve feire wyves
And certeinly he hade a mery note
Wele coude he syng and pley on a rote
Of yeddynges he bare outerly þe prys
His nek was white as a floure delys
Therto he was stronge as a champyon
He knewe the tauernes wele in euery toun
And euery hostiller and tapstere
Better þan a laser or a beggere
ffor vnto soch a worthy man as he


Accordeth noght as by his faculte  
To haue with seke lasers acqueyntaunce
It is nought honest yt may nought auaunce
ffor to dele with soch poraylle
But all with ryche and sellers of vitaylle
And ouer all þere profit shold aryse
Curteys he was and lowely of seruyce
There was no man no where so vertuous
He was þe best begger in his hous
    
    
ffor though a wydewe  had nouȝt a shoo
So plesant was his  In principio
Ȝet wold he haue  a ferthyng or he went
his purchas was wel betir  than his rent
And rage he coude  as it had be a whelp
In louedayes  there coude he meche help
ffor there he was  nat lyke a Cloisterere
with a thredbare Cope  as is a pore scolere
But he was like a Maister  or a Pope
Of double worstede  was his semy Cope
Rounde  as any belle  ouȝt of the presse
Somwhat he lisped  for his wantounesse
To make his englyssh  swete on his tonge
And in his harpyng  whan that he songe
hys eyen twynkeled  in his hede aright
As don the sterres  in a frosty nyght
This worthy lymytour  was cleped Huberd
A Marchaunnt þere was  with a forked berd
In motlee  and heye on hors he satte
And on his heued  a flaundryssh beuer hatte
His botes clasped  faire and fetisly
His resons he spak  ful solempnely
Sownyng alwey  the encres of his wynnyng
He wold þe see were kepte  for any thyng
Bytwene Midelburgh  and Orewelle


wel coude he  in eschaunges  sheldes selle
This worthy man  ful wel  his wyt bysette
There wyst no wyght  that he was in dette
So stedefastly dede he  of his gouernance
with his bargeyns  and with his cheuysance
ffor sothe he was  a worthy man with alle
But sothe to seyn  I ne wot how men him calle
A Clerk ther was  of Oxenford also
That vnto logyk  had longe Igo
And lene was his hors  as it were a rake
And he was nouȝt right fat  I vndertake
But loked holwe  and therto soberly
fful thredbare was his ouerest Courteby
ffor he had ȝet  geten him no benefice
Ne was nouȝt wordly  to haue an Office
ffor him was leuer  haue  at his beddis hede
Twenty bokes clad  in blak and in rede  
Of Aristotle  and his philosophie
Than riche robes  or fethil or sautrie
But al be it though  he were a Philosophre
Ȝet had he but litel  gold in his coffre
But al þat he  from his frendis hent
On bokes and on lernyng  he it spent
And bisily gan  for the soules pray
Of hem  þat ȝaf him  wherwith to scoley
Of stody tok he  most eure and hede
Nouȝt a word spak he  more than was nede
And þat was seide  in fourme and reuerence
And short and quyk  and ful of heigh sentence
Sownyng in moral vertue  was his speche
And gladly wold he lerne  and gladly teche
A Sergeaunt of lawe  there was  war and wys
That ful often had ben  at Pardys
That was ful riche  of excellence
Discrete he was  and of gret reuerence
he semed swich  his wordes were so wyse


Justice had he be  ful often in assise
Both by patent  and pleyn comissioun
ffor his science  and his heigh renoun
Of fees and robes  had he many on
So grete a purchasour  was nowher non
Al was fee simple  to him in effect
His purchasyng  myght nat ben  in suspect
Nowher so besy a man  as he there nas
And ȝet he semed  besiere than he was
In termes had he cas  and domes alle
That fro þe tyme  of kyng will  weren falle
Therto he coude endyte  and make a thyng
Ther coude no man pynche  at his writyng
And euery statut  coude he  pleynly by rote
He rod but homely  in a Medlee Cote
Girt with a seynt of silk  with barres smale
Of his array  telle I  no lengere tale
Affrankeleyn þere was  in this compaignye
whyt was his berd  as is the daysye
Of his complexion  he was sangweyn
wel loued he by the morwe  a soppe in vyn
To lyue in delyt  was euere his wōne
ffor he was Epiours  owen sone  
That held opynyon  that pleyn delit
was verray  felicite parfyt
An housholdere  and þat a gret was he
The grettest  of al his contre
his brede his ale  was alwey after one
A betir wyned man  was nowher none
withoute bake mete  was neuere his hous
Of fyssh and flesch  and þat so plenteuous
It sewed in his hous  of mete and drynke
Of alle deyntes  þat eny man coude thynke
After the sondry sesons  of the ȝere
So chaunged he his mete  and his sopere
fful many a fat partrich  had he in mue


And many a breme  and many a luce in stue
wo was his coke  but if his sauce were
Poynaunt and sharp  and redy al his gere
his table durmaunt  in his hall alwey
Stod redy couered  al the long day
At the sessiones  there was he lord and sire
fful often tyme  he was knyght of the shire
And an Anlaas  and a Gipciere al of silk
Heng at his girdil  as whyt as morwe mylk
A sherewe had he be  and a Countour
was nowher swich  a worthy vauasour
An haberdassher  and a Carpenter
A webbere a dighere  and a tapicer
And they were clothed  alle in oo lyuere
Of a solempne  and gret fraternite
fful fressh and newe  her gere pyked was
here knywes were nouȝt  chaped with bras
But al with siluer  wrouȝt ful clene and wele
here Girdeles  and here pouches  euerydele
wel semed ich of hem  a fair Burgeys
To sitte in the ȝildehalle  vpon þe heye deys
Euerych for the wysdom  that he can
was shaply to be  an Alderman
ffor catel hadden they Inough and rent
And eke here wyues  wold it wel assent 
And ellis serteyn  they weren to blame
It is ful feyr  to be cleped Madame
And go to the vigiles  al byfore
And haue a Mantel  rially bore  
A Coke they had  with hem for þe nones
To boyle the Chikenys  with the Maribones
And pouder Merchaunt  tart  and Galyngale
wel coude he knowe  a draught of london ale
he coude  roste  sethe  boille  and frye
Make Mortrewes  and wel bake a pye
But gret harm was it  as thouȝt me


That on his shyne  a mormal had he
And blanchemangere  mad he with the best
A Shipman there was  þat woned fer by west
ffor ought þat I wot  he was of Dertemouthe
he rod vpon a Rouncy  as wel as he coude
In a gowne of faldyng  vnto the knee
A daggere hangyng  on a lace had he
Aboute his nekke  vndir his arme adoun
The hote somer  had mad his hew al broun
And serteynly  he was a good felawe
fful many a draught  of wyn  had he drawe
ffro Burdeusward  whiles the chapmen slepe
Of nyce conscience  toke he no kepe
If þat he faught  and had the heyer hand
Be water he sent it home  fro euery lond
But to reken wel  of his craft the tydes
The stremes and the strandes hym beside is
his herberwe  his mone  and his lodes manage
There was non swich  from hulle into cartage
Hardy he was  and wys  I vndertake
with many a tempest  he had his berd shake
He knew alle the hauenes  as they were
ffro Gutlond  to the Cape de fenistre
And euery Cryke  fro Bretaigne into Spayne
his Barge was called  the Magdaleyne
With vs there was  a Doctour of Phisik
In al þis world  was non him lyk
To speke of Phesik  and of surgerie
ffor he was grounded  in Astronomye
he kept his pacience  a ful gret dele
In houres by his  magyk  naturele
Wel coude he fortunen  the accident
Of hise ymages  for be his pacient
he knew the cause  of euery maladye
wheiþer it were cold  hote  moist  or drye  
and wherof it engendered  and of what humour


he was a verray parfyt practisour
The cause he knew  and of his harm the rote
Anon he ȝaf  the syke man his bote
fful redy had he  alle hise appoticaries
To sende him draggges  and his lettuaries
ffor eche of hem  mad other for to wynne
her ffrenshipe  was nat newe  to bygynne
wel knew he  the old Esculapius
And deiscorides  and eke Rusus
Olde ypocras  and Galyen
Serapyoun  Raȝis  and Auyȝen
Auuerrois  Dasmacien  and Costantyn
Bernard  Gatisden  and Gilbertyn
Of his diete  mesurable was he
ffor he was  of no superfluite
But of gret norisshyng  and digestible
his stody was but litel  in the bible
In Sangweyn  and in pers  clad withalle
lyned with taffata  and sendalle
And ȝet he was but esy of dispence
ffor he kept þat he wan  in the pestilence
ffor gold in phisyk  is a ccordiall
Therfore he loued gold  in especiall
A good wyf þere was  of beside bathe
But she was somdel def  and þat was skathe
Of cloth makyng  she had swich an haunt
That she passed hem  of ypris and of gaunt
In all the paryssh  wyf was there non
That to offryng  aforn hire shuld gon
And if there dide  serteyn so wroth was she
That she was oute  of al charite
Hire kerches  were of fyn ground
I durst swere  they weyed doun a pound
That on the Sonday  were vpon hire hede
hire hosen were  of fyn skarlet rede
fful streite teyed  and shoon moist and newe


Bold was hire face  and feir and rede of hewe
She was a worthy womman  al hire lyue
housbondes at þe chirche dore  had she had fyue
Withouten other companye  in hire ȝouthe
But therof nedeth nat  to speke of nouthe
And thries had she ben  at Ierusalem  
She had passed  many a straunge strem
At Rome had she be  and at Boloyne
In Galice at Seynt Iameȝ  and at Coloyne
She coude meche  of wandryng by the weye
Gattothed was she  sothly to seye
Vpon an aumblere  esily she sat
Wel Iwympled  and on hire hed an hat
As brod as is  a bokeler or a targe
A fote mantel  aboute hire hepes large
And on hire fete  a peire of spores sharpe
In felashippe  coude she  laughe and carpe
The remedies of loue  she coude per chaunce
ffor of þat art  she knew þe olde daunce
A Good man þere was  of religion
That was a pore Person  of a toun
But riche he was  of holy thouȝt and werke
He was also  a lerned man  a clerke
That cristes gospel  trewely wold preche
His parisshyns deuoutly  wold he teche
Benygne he was  and wonder diligent
And in aduersite  ful abidyng  and pacient
ffor which he was preued  often sithes
fful lothe were him to curse  for his tithes
But rather wold he ȝeuen  withoute doute
Vnto his pore parisshyns  aboute
Of his offryng  and eke of his substance
he coude in litil  thyng  haue suffisance
Wyde was his parissh  and houses fer asonder
But he left nouȝt  for reyn ne for thonder
In sekenesse and in myschef  to visite


The ferthest  in his parissh  moche and lite
Vpon his feet  and in his hond a staf
This noble ensaumple  to his shepe he ȝaf
That first he wrouȝt  and afterward he taught
Ouȝt of þe gospel  he tho wordes caught
And this figure  he added eke therto
That if gold rust  what shuld Iren do
ffor if a preest be foul  on whom we trust
no wonder is  a lewed man to rust
And shame it is  if a preest take kepe
To se a sheton shepherde  and a clene shepe
Wele aught a prest ensaumple for to yeve
By his clennes how þat his shepe shold leve
He set nought his benefice to hire
And lete his shepe accombred in the mire
Ne renne to london to Seint Poules
To seche hym a chauntry for soules
Or be with a bretherhede withhold
But dwelled at home and kept wele his fold
So þat þe wolf made þere no maistrye
He was a shepard and not a mersonarye
And though he holy were and vertuous
He was nat with synfull men despitous
Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne
But in his speche discrete and benigne
To drawen folk to heven by feirenesse
By gode ensaumple þis was his besynesse
But and he knewe ony person obstenate
Whether he were hiegh or lowe astate
Hym wold he snebbe for þe nones
A better prest I trowe nowhere none ys  
He awayted after no pompe ne reuerence
Ne made hym a spiced conscience
But cristes lore and his Appostels xij
He caught but furst he folowed it him selve
Wyth hym þere was a plowman was his brothere


That hade lad of dong many a fothere
A trewe swynker and a gode was he
Levyng in pees and perfite charite
God loued he best with all his hole hert
At all tymes þough he gained or smert
And þan his neighbour right as hym selue
He wold thressh and þereto dyke and delue
ffor cristes sake for euery poure wight
without hire yf it lay in his might
His tithes payde he full faire and wele
Both of his propre swynk and of his catele
In a tabard he rode vpon a mere
There was also a Reve and a millere
A sompnour and a pardoner also
A maunciple and myself þere was no mo
The miller was a stout carle for þe nones
ffull bigge he was of brawne and of bones
That preueth wele for euer where he cam
At the wrestellyng he wold haue þe ram
He was short sholdred brode and a thik gnarre
There was no dore but he yt wold lyft of barre
Or breke it with rennyng with his hede
His berde as ony fox  was rede
And thereto brode as it were a spade
Vpon þe cop of his nose he hade
A wert and þereon stode a tuft of heirs
Rede as the bristels of sow erys
His nosethrilles blak were and wyde
A swerde and a bokeler bare he by his syde
His mouthe was as grete as a fournesse
he was a Iangeler and golyardes
And þat was most synne and harlottryes
Wel coude he stele corne and tolle iij
And yit he hade a thom of golde parde
A white cote and a blewe hode wered he  
A bagpipe wele koude he blawe and sowne


And therewithall he brought vs out of towne
Agentyll Mansiple was there of a temple
Of which al catours mighten take exemple
ffor to be wyse in bying of vitaill
ffor whether he paide or toke by taill
Alwey he wayted so in his acate
That he was ay byforn and in gode state
Now is nat that of god a full feire grace
That soch a lewde mans witte shall passe
The wysdom of an hepe of lerned men
That maistres haue hade mo than iij· ten
That of lawe were expert and curious
Of which there were a dosen in þat hous
Worthy to be stewardes of rent and londe
Of ony lord that is in Ingelonde
To make hym leve by his propre gode
In honour douteles but yf he were wode
Or lyue as skarsly as hym lyst desire
And able to helpen all a shire
In ony cas þat myght falle or happe
And yit this manciple set her aller cappe
The reve was a sklendre coloryk man
his berde was shave as nygh as euer he can
His here was by his eres full rounde shorn
His top was dokked like a prest byforn
ffull longe were his legges and full lene
Like a staf there was no calf asene
Wele koude he kepe a gerner and a byn
There was none auditour coude on him wyn
Wele wist he by the drought and by the reyn
The yeldyng of his corn and of his greyn
His lordes shepe his nete his dayre
His swyne his hors his stok and his pultrye
Was holy in this reves gouernyng
And by his couenaunt he yaf þe rekenyng
Sen þat his lord was xx· yere of age


There koude no man bryng him in arrerage
The was no baillyf herde ne other hyne
That he ne knewe her sleight and her couyne  
They were adradde of hym as of the dethe
His wonyng was feire vpon an hethe
with grene trees shadewed was his place
he koude better þan his lord purchace
ffull riche he was astored priuely
his lorde he koude plese full subtelly
To yeue and lene hym of his owen gode
And haue a thank and yit a gowne and hode
This Reve satte vpon a well gode stot
All pomely grey and he hight scot
lerned he hade in youth a gode meistere
He was a gode wright a Carpentere
A long surcote of Pers vpon he hade
And by his syde he bare a lusty blade
Of Norfolk was this Reve of which I telle
Beside a toun men clepe Baldeswell
Tukked he was as ys a frere aboute
And euer he rode þe hyndrest of þe route
Asompnour was þere with vs in þat place
That hade a feire rede cherubyns face
ffull saussleem he was with yen narow
As hote he was and licherous as a sparow
With skalled browes blake and pyled berde
Of his visage children were aferde
There was neyther lytarge quiksiluer ne bremstone
Borage ceruce ne oyle of tartre none
Ne oynement þat wolde clense and byte
That hym might help of his whelkes white
Ne of þe knobbes sutyng in his chekes
Wele loued he garlyk oynons and lekes
And for to drynke stronge wyne as rede as blode
Than wold he speke and crye as he were wode
And whan þat he wele dronken hade the wyne


Than wold he speke no worde but latyn
A fewe termes hade he ij· or iij·
That he hade lerned out of som decre
No wonder ys he herde yt all the day
And eke he knowe wele how þat a Iay
Kan clepe wat as wele as kan þe pope
But who so koude in other thinges hym grope  
Than hade he spent all his felosophie
Ay questio quid Iuris wold he crye
He was a gentill harlot and a kynde
A better felaw shold men nowhere fynde
He wold suffre for a quart of wyne
A gode felaw to haue his concubyne
A twelmonth and excuse hym atte full
ffull priuely eke a fynche koude he pulle
And yf he fonde owhere a gode felawe
He wold tech hym to haue none awe
In swich cas of þe Archedekenes curs
But yf a mans soule heng in his purs
ffor his purs he shold pyned be
purs is the Erchedekenes hell quod he
But wele I wote he lyeth right in dede
Of cursyng ought euery gilty man to drede
ffor curs will slee right as assoylyng saueth
And also ware hym of a significaueth
In daungere hade he at his owen gyse
All the yong gerles of the diocyse
And knewe her counseill and was all her rede
A gerlonde he hade set vpon his hede
As grete as yt were for an ale stake
A bokeler hade he made hym of a cake
Wyth hym there rode a gentyll pardonere
Of rouncyvale his felawe and his compere
That streight was come fro the court of Rome
ffull loude he song come hyder loue come
This sumpnour bare to hym a styf burdon


Was neuer trompe of half so grete a soun
This pardoner hade here as yelowe as ony wex
But smoth hang it as doth a stryke of flex
By ounces hyng his lokkes that he hade
And therewith his sholdres it ouersprade
But thynne yt lay by culpons one and one
And hode for iolyte wered he none
ffor it was trussed vp in his walet
hym thought he rode all of þe newe get
Dyscheuele saue his cape he rode all bare
With glaryng yen as hath an hare  
A vernicle hade he sewed on his cappe
Hys walet ley byforn hym in his lappe
ffret full of pardon come fro Rome all hote
A voys he hade as small as hath a gote
No berde hade he ne neuer shold haue
Als smoth yt was as yt were newe shaue
I trowe he were a geldyng or a mare
But of his craft fro Berewyk vnto Ware
Ne was there soch another pardonere
ffor in his male he hade a pelough bere
Which that he seid was our lady veill
He seid he hade a gobet of the saill
That seint Petir hade when he went
Vpon þe see tyll Ihesu crist hym hent
he hade a croos of laton full of stones
And in a glas he hade pyggesbones
But which thise relikkes whan þat he fonde
A poure person dwellyng vpon londe
Vpon a day he gate hym more money
Than þe person gate in monethes twey
And thus with his feyned flaterye and Iapes
He made þe person and the peple his Apes
But trewely to telle at the last
He was in chirche a noble eccliast
Wele koude he rede a lesson or a story


But altherbest he song an affertory
ffor wele he wist whan þat song was song
He most preche and wele afile his tong
To wyn siluer as he wele koude
Therfore he song so mery and so loude
Now how I tolde you sothely in a clause
The state the array the nombre and the cause
Why þat assembled was this company
In Suthwerk at this gentill Ostry
That hight þe Tabard fast by the belle
But now yt ys tyme to yow for to telle
How þat we bare vs þat ilk nyght
When we were in þe ostry alight
And after will I telle of our viage
And all the remenaunt of our pilgrymage  
But first I pray yow of your curtesy
That ye ne arrete nat my velany
Though þat I pleinly speke in this matere
To telle you her wordes and her chere
Ne though I speke her wordes proprely
ffor this ye knowe as wele as I
Whoso shall telle a tale after a man
he most reherce as nygh as euer he can
Euery word yf yt be in his charge
Speke he neuer so rewdely ne so large
Or elles he mote telle his tale vntrewe
Or feyn thing or fynde wordes newe
He may nought spare allthogh yt were his brother
He mote as wele sey o· worde as an other
Crist spake hym self full brode in holy wryt
And wele ye wote no velany ys yt
Eke plato seith whoso can hym rede
The wordes most be cosyn to the dede
Also I pray you to forgeve it me
Thogh I haue nat set folk in her degre
Here in this tale as that they shold stond


My wit is short ye may wele vndrestond
Grete chere made our host vs euerychone
And to soper set we vs anone
He serued vs with vitailles at þe best
Strong was the wyne and wele drynke vs lest
A semely man our host was withall
ffor to ben a Marchall in an hall
A large man he was with yen stepe
A feirer burgeys was there nought in chepe
Bold of his speche and wyse and wele taght
And of manhode lakked hym right naght
Eke he was therto a mery man
And after soper pley he began
And spak of mirthe  among other thynges
Whan þat he had mad  oure rekenynges
And seide  lo lordyngges trewely
Ȝe ben to me  right welcome hertily
ffor be my treuthe  if that I shal nat lye
I sey nat þis ȝere  so merie a companye
At ones  in this herberwe  as is nowe
ffayn wold I do ȝow myrthe  and I wist howe
And of a mirthe  I am ryght now beþouȝt
To don ȝow ease  and it shal cost nouȝt
 Ȝe gon to Caunterbury  god ȝow spede
That blisful martir  quyte ȝow ȝoure mede
And wel I wot  as ȝe gon by the weye
ȝe shapen ȝow to talken  and to pleye
ffor trewely  comfort ne mirthe is non
To ride by the weye  as dom as it were a ston
And þerfore wyl I  maken ȝow disport
As I seide erst  and do ȝow som comfort
And if ȝow like  alle be one assent
To stonden  at my Iuggement
And for to werken  as I shal ȝow sey
Tomorwe  whan ȝe riden by the wey
Now be my faders soule  þat is dede


But ȝe be merie  I wyl ȝeue ȝow myn hede
holde vp ȝoure hondes  withoute more speche
Oure counseil was nouȝt  longe for to seche
Vs þouȝt it was nat worthy  to make it nyce
And graunted him  withoute more avyse
And bad him sey  his verdyt as him lest
  lordyngges quod he  now herkeneth for the best
But take it nouȝt  I prey ȝow in disdeyn
This is þe poynt  to speke it short and pleyn
That eche of ȝow  to short with ȝoure weye
In this viage  shall telle tales tweye
To Caunterburyward  I mene it so
And homward  he shal telle othere two
Of auentures  that whilom  han byfalle
And which of ȝow  bereth him best of alle
That is to seyn  that telleth in þis cas
Tales  of most sentence and solas
Shal haue a soper  at our alder cost
Here in this place  sittyng by this post  
whan þat we comen ageyn  fro Caunterbury
And for to make ȝow  the more mery
I wyl my self goodly  with ȝow ryde
Right at myn owen cost  and be ȝoure guyde
And who so wyl  my Iuggement withsey
shal paie al that we spende  by the wey
And if ȝe wouchesaue  þat it be so
Telle me anon  withoute wordes mo
And I wyl erly  shape me therfore
This þing was graunted  and oure othes swore
with ful glad hert  and prayed him also
That he wold vouchesaue  so to do
And that he wolde be  oure gouernour
And of our tales  Iugge and reportour
And sette a soper  at a certein prise
And we wyl reuled be  at his deuyse
In heygh and lowe  and thus by one assent


we be acorded  to his Iuggement 
And thervpon  the wyn was fet anon

withouten eny lengere  tariyng
  A morwe  whan þe day gan spryng
Vp ros oure Ost  and was oure aller Cok
And gadered vs to gedir  on a flok
And forth we redyn  a litel pas
vnto the wateryng  of seynt Thomas
And there oure Ost  bygan his hors arest
And seide lordes  herkeneth if ȝow list
Ȝe wete oure forward  if ȝe it record
If euesong  and morwesong accord

As euere mote I drynke  wyn or ale

Shal paie for al þat is  by the weye Ispent
Now draweth cutte  er we ferthere twynne

  Sire Knyght quod he  my maister and my lord
Now draweth Cutte  for this is myn accord
Cometh nere quod he  my lady Prioresse
And ȝe sire clerk  late be ȝoure shamefastnesse
Ne studieth nought  ley hand to euery man  
Anon to drawe  euery wyght bygan
And shortly to telle  as it was
were it by auenture  or sort  or cas
The soth is this  the kut fel on the knyght
Of which ful glad  was euery wyght
And telle he must his tale  as it was reson
By forward  and by composicion
As ȝe han herd  what nedeth wordes mo
And whan þis good man  saugh þat it was so
As he þat wys was  and obedient
To kepe his forward  by his free assent
And seide  sithe  I shal begynne þe game


welcome be the cutte  in goddes name
Now late vs ride  and herkeneth what I sey
And with þat word  we redyn forth oure wey
And he bygan  with right a mery chere
This tale anon  and seide on þis manere

Whilom there was  as olde stories tellen vs
A Duke  a worthy man that hight Theseus
Of Athenes  he was lord and gouernour
And in his tyme  swiche a conquerour
That grettere was ther non  vnder the sonne
fful many a riche contre  had he wonne
what with his wysdom  and Chyualrie
He conquered al the regne  of femenye
That whilom cleped was  Scithia
And wedded the fressh quene  ypolita
And brouȝt hire hom with him  to his contre
with meche glorie  and grete solempnyte
And eke hire ȝonge suster  Emelye
And thus with blisse  and with victorie
Lete I this noble Duke  to Athenes ride
And al his Ost  in armes  by his side
And certes if it ne were  to longe to here
I wold haue told fully  the manere
How wonne was the regne  of ffemonye
By Theseus  and by his cheualrie  
And of the grete bataille  for the nones
Bytwene the Athenes  and Amasones
And how assegid was  Ipolita
The fair hardy Quene  of Scithia
And of the fest þat was  at hire weddyng
And of the temple  at hire hom commyng
But al this thyng  I mot as now forbere
I haue god wote  a large felde to ere
And weyke be the Oxen  in my plow
The remenaunt of my tale  is long Inow
I wil nouȝt letten eke  non of þis route


Lete euery felawe  tellen his tale aboute
And lat se now  who shal the soper wynne
And there as I left  I wyl aȝein begynne
This Duke  of which I made mencion
whan he was come  almost to the toun
In al his wele  and in his most pride
He was ware  and cast his eye aside
where that there kneled  in the heye weye
A companye of ladies  tweye and tweye
Eche after other  clothed in clothes blake
But swich a cry  and swich a woo they make
That in þis world  is no creature leuyng
That euere herd swich anoþer  weymentyng
And of this cry  they wold neuere stynt 
Til they the Reyne  of his bridel hent 
what folk be ȝe  that at myn hom comyng
Perturbeth so my folk  with criyng
Quod Theseus  haue ȝe so gret enuye
Of myn honour  þat ȝe þus compleyne and crye
Or who hath ȝow mysboden  or offended
Do  telle me  if þat it may be amended
And why ȝe be thus clothed al in blak
The eldest lady of hem alle  þanne spak
whan she had swowned  with a dedly chere
That it was reuthe  for to sene and here
And seide lord  to whom fortune  hath Iȝeuen
Victorie  and as a conquerour to leuen
Nouȝt greueth vs ȝoure glorie  ne Honour
But we beseke ȝow  of mercy and socour
Haue mercy on oure woo  and oure distresse
Some drope of pyte þurgh þy gentillesse
Vpon vs wrecched wommen lete þou falle  
ffor certes lord þere is none of vs all
That we haue be a duchesse or a quene
Now be we caytyfs as it is wele sene
Thanked be fortune and hir fals whele


That none astate assureth to be wele
And certes lord to abide your presence
Here in this temple of goddes clemence
We haue be wayting all þis fourtenyght
Now helpe vs lord setth it is in thy might
I wrecch which þat wepe and wayll þus
Whilom was wyf to kyng Capaneus
That starf at Thebes cursed be the day
And all we þat ben in this array
And make all this lamentacion
We lost all our housbondes at þat toun
While þat þe sege there aboute lay
And yit now the olde creon weleaway
That lord is now of Thebes þe Citee
ffulfilled of ire and iniquitee
he for despyte and tyrannye
To done the dede bodyes velanye
Of all our lordes which þat ben slawe
He hath all bodies on an hepe drawe
And will nat suffre by none assent
Neyther to be buried ne ybrent
But make houndes ete hem in despite
And with þat worde without more respite
They fell grovelyng and cried pitously
haue on vs wrecched wommen som mercy
And lete our sorow synk in thyne hert
This gentyll duk from his corsour stert
With hert pitous whan he herde hem speke
hym thoght þat his hert wold breke
When he saw hem so pitous and so mate
That somtyme were of so grete astate
And in his armes he hem all hent
And hem comforted in full gode entent
And swore his oth as he was trewe knight
he wold done so ferforth his might
Vpon this Tiraunt Creon hem to wreke  

That all þe peple of grece thereof shold speke
how Creon was of Thebes serued
As he þat hade full wele his deth deserued
And right anone without more abode
His baner he desplayeth and forth rode
To Thebes ward and all his ost beside
Ne nere Athenes wold he go ne ride
Ne take his ese fully half a day
But onward on his way that nyght he lay
And sent anone to ypolita þe quene
And Emely hir yonge suster shene
Vnto Athenes þere for to dwell
And forthe he rode there is no more to telle
The rede statute of Mars with spere and targe
So shineth in his white baner large
That all the feldes gliteren vp and doun
And by his baner born was his penoun
Of gold full riche in which there was ybete
The manatour which þat he wan in Crete
Thus rideth this duk this noble conquerour
And in his ost of chiualrye þe flour
Till þat he came to Thebes and alight
ffeir in a felde there as he thought to fight
But shortly for to speke of this thing
With Creon which was of Thebes kyng
He faught and slewe him manly as a knight
In plein batell and put his folk to flight
And by assent he wan þe Cite after
And rent adoun spar wall and rafter
And to the ladies he restored hath ageyn
The bones of her housbondes þat were sleyn
To do obsequies as was tho the gyse
But it were all to long for to deuyse
The grete clamour and þe grete weymentyng
That the ladies made at the brennyng
Of the bodies and the grete honour


That Theseus this noble conquerour
doth to thise ladies when they fro him went
But shortly to telle is myn entent
Whan þat þis worthy duk this Theseus  
hath Creon sleine and wonne Thebes thus
Stille in þat felde he toke all night his rest
And did with all þe contre as hym lest
To ransake in the taas of þe bodyes dede
Hym for to strype of harneys and of wede
The pilours didden her besynesse and cure
After the bataill and the discomfiture
And so befill þat in the taas they founde
Thurgh gurt with many a greuous wounde
Two yong knightes liggyng by and by
Both in one armes wroght full richely
Of which two Arcita was þat one
And þat other knight hight Palamone
Noght fully quyk ne fully dede they were
But by her cotearmes and by her gere
The heraudes knew hem best of all
As they that weren of þe blode riall
Of Thebes and of two susters born
Out of the taas the pilours haue hem born
And han hem caried soft vnto the tent
Of theseus and full sone he hem hent
And sent to Athenes to dwell in prison
perpetuelly withouten raunson
And whan this worthy duk hath þus done
He toke his ost and home he ryt anone
with lauriell crowned as a conquerour
And there he leved in ioy and honour
Terme of his lyf what nedeth wordes mo
And in a tourne of angwyssh and of wo
Dwellen thise palamon and his felawe arcite
ffor euermore there may no gold hem quite
This passeth yere by yere and day by day


Till it befell ones in a morow of May
That Emely that feirer was to sene
Then is the lilly vpon þe stalk so grene
And fressher þan þe May with floures new
ffor with þe rose stroue hir hewe
I note which was þe feirer of hem two
Er it were day as was hir wont to do
She was aresen and all redy dight  
ffor May woll haue no slogardrye a night
That seson prykketh euery gentell hert
And maketh hym out of his slepe to stert
And seith arise and do thine obseruance
This meyde Emelye to haue remembrance
To don honour to May and for to ryse
Clothed was she fressh for to deuyse
Her yelow heres browded were in o tresse
Behinde hir bak a yerde longe as I gesse
And to the gardyn at the sonne vprest
She walketh vp and doun and as hir lest
She gadred floures party white and rede
To make a sotell garlond for hir hede
And as an Angell hevenlich she songe
The toure þat was so thik and so stronge
Which of þe castell was þe chief dongeon
There as thise knightes were in prison
Of which I told you and telle shall
Was even ioynyng to þe gardyn wall
There as this Emely hade hir pleying
Bright was the son and clere þe mornyng
And palamon þis wofull prisoner
As was his wone by leve of his gayler
Was risen and romed in the chambre on high
In the which he all the noble Citee sigh
And eke þe gardyn full of braunches grene
There as this fressh Emelye the shene
And was hir walke and romed vp and doun


This wofull prisoner þis palamon
Goth in the chambre to and fro
And to him self compleynyng of his wo
That he was born full oft cried he allas
And so befill þat by auenture or cas
That thurgh þe wyndowe thik of many a barre
Of Iren grete and square as ony sparre
He cast his yee vpon Emelya
And therewithall he blent and cried A
As thogh he stongen were vnto the hert
And with þat crie Arcite anone vp stert
And seide Cosyn myn what eyleth the  
That art so pale and dedely for to see
Why cridest thow who hath the don offence
ffor goddes sake take it in pacience
Our prison for it may none other be
ffortune hath yeve vs this aduersite
Som wikked aspect or disposicioun
Of Saturne by som constillacioun
hath yeve vs this althogh we hade sworn
So stode the heven whan that we were born
We most endure this is the short and plein
This palamon answerd and seide agein
Cosyn forsoth of þis opinion
Thow hast a veyn ymaginacon
This prison caused me not for to cryee
But I was hurt right now þurgh myn yee
Into myn hert þat yt will my bane be
The feirenes of þat lady that I se
Yonder in the gardyn romyng to and fro
Is cause of all my crying and my wo
I ne wote whether she be a womman or a goddes
But Venus I trow it be as I gesse
And therewithall on knees he fill
And seid Venus yf it be thy will
Now in þis gardyn thus þe to transfigure


Byfore me sorowfull wrecched creature
Out of this prison helpe þat we may skape
And yf so be our desteny be shape
By eterne worde to dey in prison
Of our linage haue som compassion
That is so lowe brought by tyrannye
And with that worde Arcite gan aspie
Where as this lady romed to and fro
And with þat sight hir beaute hurt him so
That yf þat palamon was wounded sore
Arcite is hurt as moch or more
And with þat sight he seide pitously
Thy fressh beaute sleth me sodeinly
Of hir þat rometh þere in yondre place
And but yf I haue hir mercy and hir grace
That I may seyn hir at the lest wey  
I am but dede there is no more to sey
This palamon whan he thise wordes herd
Dispitously he loked and answerd
Whether seist thow this in ernest or in play
Nay quod Arcite in ernest by my fay
God helpe me so me lust yuell to pley
This palamon gan to knytte his browes twey
Yt were to the quod he no grete honour
ffor to be fals and for to be a traytour
To me that am þy Cosyn and þy brother
Isworn full depe and ecch of vs to other
That neuer for to dey in peyne
Till þat the deth depart shall vs tweyne
Neyther of vs in loue to hynder other
Ne in none other caas my leve brother
But that þou sholdest trewly forther me
In euery caas as I shall forther the
This was thine· othe· and myn certeyn
I wote right wele þou darst it nat withseyn
Thus art þou of my counseill out of dout


And now þou woldest falsly bene about
To loue my lady whom I loue and serue
And euere shall tyll þat my hert sterue
Nay certes fals Arcite thow shalt nat so
I loued hir first and told the my wo
As to my counseill and to my brother sworn
To forther me as I haue told byforn
ffor which þou art bounde as a knight
To help me yf it lay in thy myght
Or elles art þou fals I dare wele seyn
This Arcite proudely spake ageyn
Thow shalt quod he be rather fals þan I
And þou art fals I telle the witterly
ffor parauenture I loued hir first or thow
What will þou sey þou wost it now
Whether she be a womman or a goddesse
Thyn is the affeccon of holynesse
And myn is love as to a creature
ffor which I telle the myn auenture
As to my Cosyn and my brother swore  
I purpose þat þou lovedest hir byfore
Wost þou nat wele þat olde clerkes sawe
That who shall yeve lovers ony lawe
Love is a gretter lawe by my pan
Than be yeven may to ony erthly man
And therfore posityf lawe and swich decre
Is broken all day for love in ecch degre
A man most love nedys maugre in his hede
He may noght fle yt though he shold be dede
Al be she  Mayde  wydewe  or ellis wyff
And eke it is nouȝt likly  al thy lif
To stonde in hire grace  no more shal I
ffor wel þou wost  thy seluen verayly
That þou and I  be dampned to prison
Perpetuelly  vs geyneth no raunson
We striue  as dide þe houndes  for þe bon


That faught al day  and ȝet here part was non
There cam a kyte  whyle þei were so wrothe
And bar awey þe bon  bytwen hem bothe
And þerfore  at þe kynges court  my brother
Eche for him self  there is non other
 loue if þou list  for I loue and ay shal
And sothly leue brother  this is al
Here in prison  mote we endure
And ech of vs  take his aventure
  Gret was þe strif  and longe bytwen hem twey
If þat I had leyser  for to sey
But to the effect  it happed on a day
To telle it ȝow  as shortly as I may
A worthy Duke  that hight Parotheus
That felawe was  to þis Duke theseus
Syn thilk day  þat þei were children lyte
was come to Athenes  his felawe to visite
ffor to pley  as he was wont to do
ffor in the world  he loued no man so
And he loued him  as tenderly ageyn
So wele they loued  as olde bokes seyn
That whanne þat on was ded  soth to telle
his felawe went  and sought him doun in helle
But of that story  list ne nat to wryte
Duke Parotheus  loued wel Arcite
And had him knowe  at Thebes ȝere by ȝere
And finally at the request  and prayere
Of Parotheus  withoute ony raunsom
Duke Theseus  lete him ouȝt of prison
ffreely to go  where as him list ouer alle
In swich a gyse  as I ȝow telle shalle
This was the forward  pleynly to endite
Bytwene Theseus  and this Arcite
That if so were  þat Arcite were founde
Euere in his lyue  by day or nyght o stounde  
In ony contre  of this Theseus


And he were caught  it was acorded thus
That with a swerd  he shulde lese hise hede
There was non oþer remedy  ne rede
But taketh his leue  and homward he him spedde
Lat him be ware  his nekke lith to wedde
So gret a sorwe  suffreth now Arcite
The deth he feleth  þurugh his hert smyte
he wepeth and wayleth  he crieth pytously
To sle him self  he wayteth preuyly
He seide allas  the day þat he was born
Now is my prison wers  than biforn
Now is me shape  eternely to dwelle
Nought in purgatorie  but in helle
Allas þat euere I knew  Parotheus
ffor elles had I dwelled  with Duke Theseus
ffetered in his prison  for euere mo
Than had I ben in blisse  and nouȝt in woo
Only the sight of hire  whom þat I serue
Though þat I neuere  hire grace may deserue
wold haue suffised  right Inow to me
O dere Cosyn  Palamon  quod he
Thyn is the victorie  of this auenture
fful blisfully in prison  maist þou endure
In prison  nay certes  but in Paradys
wel hath fortune  turned the the dys
Thou hast the sight  of hire  and I the absence
ffor possible it is  sith þou hast hire presence
And art a knyght  a worthy and an able
That be som cas  sithe fortune is chaungeable
Thow maist to thy desyre  som tyme atteyne
But I þat am exiled  and barayne
Of alle grace  and in so gret dispeyre
That there nys no water  ffyr  ne Eyre
Ne creature  that of hem maked Is
That may me hele  or do comfort in this
wel ought I sterue  in wanhope and distresse


ffare wel my lyf  my lust  and my gladnesse
  Allas why pleyne so folk  in comune
Of purueance of god  or of fortune
That ȝeueth hem ful oft  in many gyse  
wel beter  þanne þei can  hem self deuyse
Somme men desire  for to haue richesse
That cause is of here mordre  or gret seknes
And somme man wold  out of prison fayn
That in his hous  is of his meyne slayn
Infenyt harmes  ben in this matere
we wot neuere  what we preisen here
we faren as he  þat dronken is as a mous
A dronke man wot wel  he hath an hous
But he ne wot which is  þe right weye theder
And to a dronke man  the weye is slyder
And certes in þis world  so fare we
we seke fast after  felicite
But we gon wrong  ful ofte trewely
Thus may we seyn alle  and namely I
That wende  and had  a gret opinyon
That if I myght escape  from prison
Than had I ben  in ioye and parfyt hele
That now am exiled  fro my wele
Syn I may nouȝt se ȝow  Emelye
I am but ded  þere is non oþer remedye
  Vpon þat oþer side  Palamon
whan þat he wist  þat Arcite was gon
Swich sorwe he maketh  þat the grete Tour
Resouned of his Ianglyng  and clamour
The pure feteres  on his shynes grete
were of his bittere  salt teres  wete
Allas quod he  Arcite Cosyn myn
Of al oure strif  god wot þe fruyt is thyn
Thow walkest now  in Thebes at thy large
And of my woo  þou ȝeuest litel charge
Thow maist  sithe þou hast  wysdom and manhode


Assemble alle the folk  of oure kynrede
And make a werre so sharp  on this Citee
That be som auenture  or tretee
Thow maist haue hire  to lady and to wyf
ffor whom I must nedes  lese my lyf
ffor as be weye  of possibilitee
sithe þou art at þe large  of prison free
And art a lord  gret is þin auauntage
More þan myn  þat sterueth here in a cage  
ffor I mote wepe  and wayle while I leue
with al the woo  þat prison may me ȝeue
And eke with peyne  that loue me ȝeueth also
That doubleth al my turment  and my woo
  Therwith  the fyr of ielousie vp stirte
withInne his brest  and hent him by the herte
So wodly  þat he lyke was  to behold
To Box tree  or to asshen  dede and cold
  Thanne seide he  O cruel goddes þat gouerne
This world with byndyng  of ȝoure word eterne
And wryte in the table  of Athamante
Ȝoure parlament  and ȝoure eterne graunte
what is mankynde more  vnto ȝow hold
Than is a shepe  that rukketh in the fold
ffor slayn is man  right as an other best
And dwelleth eke  in prison  and arrest
And hath seknes  and gret aduersitee
And often tymes  giltlees parde
what gouernance is  in this prescience
That giltles  turmentist Innocence
And ȝet encreseth this  al my penaunce
That man is bounde  to his obseruance
ffor goddes sake  to letten of his wylle
There as a best may  al his lust fulfille
And when a best is ded  he hath no peyne
But after his deth  a man mote wepe and pleyne
Though in þis world  he haue care and woo


withoute doute  it may stonde so
The answere of þis  lete I to deuynes
But wel I wot  in þis world gret peyne is
  Allas  I se a serpent or a thef
That many a trewe man  hath do myschef
Gon at his large  and where him list may turne
But I mot be in prison  thurugh saturne
And eke þurugh Iuno Ielous  and eke wode
That hath wel ny destroyed  al the blode
Of Thebes  with his wast walles wyde
And Venus sleth me  on þat other syde
ffor ielousye  and feer of þis Arcite
Now wyl I stynt  of Palamon a lyte
And lete him in this prison stille dwelle  
And of Arcite  forth I wyl ȝow telle
  The somer passeth  and the nyghtes longe
Encresynge double wyse  the peynes stronge
Bothe of the louere  and of the prisoner
I ne wot which hath  the sorwefullest myster
ffor shortly to seyn  this Palamon
Perpetuelly  is dampned to prison
In cheynes and in feteres  to be ded
And Arcite is exiled  vpon his hed
ffor euere more  ouȝt of þat contre
Ne neuere more  he shal his lady se
Now louyers I ask ȝow  this question
Who hath the werse  Arcite or Palamon
That on may se his lady  day by day
But in prison  mote he dwellen ay
That other where him list  may ride or go
But sen his lady  shal he neuere mo
Now demeth as ȝow list  ȝe þat can
ffor I wyl telle ȝow forth  as I began

  Whan þat Arcite  to Thebes come was
fful ofte a day  he swelte and seide allas
ffor sen my lady  shal I neuere mo
And shortly to concluden  al his woo
So meche sorwe  had neuere creature
That is or shal  while þe world may dure
his slepe his mete and drynk  is him byraft
That lene he wex and drye  as is a shaft
His eyen holwe  and grysely to beholde
his hewe falwe  and pale  as asshen colde
And solitarie he was  and euere allone
And walkyng al þe nyght  makyng his mone
And if he herd song  or Instrument
Than wold he wepe  he myght nat stynt
So feble eke were hise spirites  and so lowe
And chaunged so  þat noman koude him knowe
His speche ne his vois  though men yt herde
And in his gere  for al the world he ferde
Nouȝt only lyke  the louyers maladye
Of hereos  but rather lyke Manye
Engendred  of humour  malicolyk  
Byforn his owen  Celle fantasyk
And shortly turned  was al vp so doun
Bothe habit  and eke disposicioun
Of hym  this wooful louyer Arcite
what shuld I al day  of hys woo endite
whan he endured had  a ȝere or two
Thys cruel turment  and thys peyne and woo
At Thebes in his contre  as I seyde
Vpon a nyght in slepe  as he him leyde
him þouȝt how þat  the wynged god Mercurie
Byforn him stod  and bad him to be merie
his slepy yerde  in honde he bar vpright
An hatte he wered  vpon his heris bright


Arrayed was þis god  as I tok kepe
As he was  whan Argus  toke his slepe
And seide him thus  to Athenes shalt þou wende
There is the shapen  of thy woo an ende
  And with that word  Arcite woke and stirt
Now trewely  how sore þat me smert
Quod he  to Athenes  right now wyl I fare
Ne for the drede of deth  I wyl nat spare
To se my lady  whom þat I loue and serue
In hire presence  I rekke nouȝt  though I sterue
And with þat word  he caught a gret Myrour
And saw  þat chaunged was al his colour
And saw his visage  al in an oþer kynde
And right anon  it ran him in his mynde
That sithe his face  was so disfigured
Of maladye  that he had endured
He myght wele ȝeue  that he bare hym lowe
Lyue in Athenes  eueremore vnknowe
And sen his lady  wel ny day by day
And right anon  he chaunged his array
And clad him  as a pore laborere
And al alone  saue oonly a squyere
That knew his preuyte  and al his cas
which was disgysed  porely as he was
To a Athenes is he gon  the next wey
And to the court  he com on a dey
And at the gate  he profred his seruyse
To drugge and drawe  what men wold deuyse  
And shortly of this matere  for to seyn
He fel in office  with a Chaumberleyn
The which þat dwellyng was  with Emelye
ffor he was wys  and coude sone espie
Of euery seruaunt  which þat serueth hire
wel coude he hewe  wode  and water bere
ffor he was ȝong and myghty  for þe nones
And therto he was long  and bygge of bones


To don þat ony wyght  can him deuyse
A ȝere or two  he was in this seruyse
Page of the chaumbre  of Emelye the bryght
And Philostrate he seide  that he hight
But half so wel byloued a man  as he
Ne was þere neuere in courte  of his degre
he was so gentil  of condicioun
That þorughouȝt al þe court  was his renoun
They seiden þat it were  a charite
That Theseus wold  enhaunce his degre
And putten him  in worshipful seruyse
There as he myght  his vertue exercise
And thus withInne a while  his name is spronge
Both of his dedes  and his goode tonge
That Theseus hath taken him  so nere
That of his chaumbre  he mad him a squyere
And ȝaf him gold  to meyntene his degree
And eke men brouȝt him  ouȝt of his contre
ffrom ȝere to ȝere  ful preuyly his rent
But honestly and slily  he it spent
That no man wondrede  how þat he it hadde
And thre ȝere in this wyse  his lyf he ladde
And bar him so in pees  and eke in werre
There was no man  þat Theseus hath derre
  And in this blisse  lete I now Arcite
And speke I wyl of Palamon  a lyte
In derknesse and orrible  and strong prison
This seuene ȝer  hath seten Palamon
fforpyned  what for woo  and for distresse
who feleth double soor  and heuynesse
But Palamon  þat loue distreyneth so
That wod ouȝt of his wytte  he goth for woo
And eke therto  he is a prisonere
Perpetuelly  nought oonly for a ȝere
  who coude ryme  in englyssh proprely  
hys martirdom  by god it am nat I


Therfore I passe  as lightly as I may
It fel  that in the  vij  ȝere  in May
The thridde nyght  as olde bokes seyn
That al this storie  tellen more pleyn
were it by auenture  or destyne
As whan a þing is shapen  it shal be
That sone after the mydnyght  Palamon
Be helpyng of a frende  brake his prison
And fleeth the Citee  as fast as he may go
ffor he had ȝeue  his Iayler drynke so
Of Clarry  mad of a certeyn wyne
with Nerkotikes and opye  of Thebes fyne
That al þat nyght  þough þat men wold him shake
The Iayler slep so  he myght nouȝt wake
  And thus he fleeth  as fast as euere he may
The nyght was short  and fast by the day
That nedes cost  he must him seluen hyde
And to a groue  fast there besyde
with dredful fote  than walketh Palamon
ffor shortly  this was his oppinyon
That in þat groue  he wold him hyde al day
And in the nyght  þan wold he take his wey
To Thebes ward  his frendes for to pray
On Theseus to helpen him  to werrey
And shortly  eiþer he wold lese hise lyf
On wynnen Emelye  vnto his wyf
This is þe effect  and his entent pleyn
  Now wyl I turne  to Arcite ageyn
That litel wyst  how ny þat was his care
Til þat fortune  had brought him in þe snare
The besy larke  the messanger of day
Saleweth in hir song  the morwe gray
And verray Phebus  riseth vp so bryght
That al þe orient  laugheth of þe light
And with hise stremes  drieth in the greues
The siluer dropes  hangyng on the leues


And Arcite þat is  in the court rial
with Theseus  the squyer principal
ys rysen and loketh  on the mery day
And for to don  his obseruaunce to May
Remembryng on þe poynt  of his desyre
He on a courser stertlyng as the fire
Is ryden into the feldes hym to pley
Out of þe court were it a myle or twey
And to the groue of which that I you told
By auenture his wey he gan hold
To maken him a gerlond of þe greues
Were it of wodebynd or hathorn leues
And lowde he song ayein the son shene
May with all thy floures and þy grene
Welcome be þow feire fressh May
In hope that I som grene gete may
And from his courser with a lusty hert
Into the grove full hastely he stert
And in a path he rometh vp and doun
There as by auenture this palamon
Was in a bussh þat no man might him se
ffor sore aferde of his deth than was he
No thing knewe he þat it was Arcite
God wote he wold haue trowed it full lyte  
But soth is seide gone seth ys many yeres
That felde hath yen and wode hath eres
It is full feire a man to bere hym even
ffor all day meteth men at vnset steven
ffull litell wote Arcite of his felawe
That was so ny to herken all his sawe
ffor in this bussh he sitteth now full stylle
Whan þat Arcite hade romed all his fylle
And songen all the roundell lustely
Into a stody he felle so sodeinly
As done thise louers in her queint geres
Now in the crop now in the breres


Now vp now doun as boket in a well
Right as þe friday sothly for to tell
Now yt shineth now it reyneth fast
Right so caan gery venus ouercast
The hertes of hir folk right as hir day
Is geerfull right so chaungeth she array
Selde is the friday all the woke lyke
Whan that Arcite hade songe he gan to syke
And set him doun withouten ony more
Allas quod he that day þat I was bore
How longe Iuno thurgh thy cruelte
Wyll þou weren Thebes the Cite
Allas ybrought is to confusion
The blode ryall of Cadme and amphion
Of Cadmus which that was the first man
That Thebes bylde or first the toun began
And of þe Cite first was crowned Kyng
Of his lynage am I and his ofspring
By verray lyne as of the stok roiall
And now I am so kaytyfd and so thrall
That he that is my mortall enemy
I serue him as his squier pourely
And yit doth Iuno me wel more shame
I dare nat byknow myn owen name
But there as I was wont to hight Arcite
Now hight I philostrate nat worth a mite
Allas þow fell mars allas Iuno
Thus hath your Ire all our lynage fordo  
Saue only me and wrecched Palamon
That Theseus martireth in his prison
And ouer all this to sle me outerly
Loue hath his verry dart so brennyngly
Isteked thurgh my trewe carefull hert
That shapen was my dethe erst er my shert
Ye sle me with your yeen Emelye
Ye been the cause wherfore that I dye


Of all þe remenaunt of myn other care
Ne set I nat the mountance of a tare
So that I koude do ought to your plesance
And with that word he felle doun in a trance
A long tyme and afterward he vp sterte
This palamon that thoght that thurgh his hert
He felt a cold swerd sodeinly glyde
ffor Ire he quoke no lenger wold he byde
And whan that he hade herde Arcites tale
As he were wode with face dede and pale
He stert hym vp out of the buskes thykke
And seide Arcite fals traytour wykke
Now art þou hent þow louest my lady so
ffor whom that I haue all this peyn and wo
And art my blode and to my counseill sworn
As I full oft haue told the here byforn
And hast beiaped here duk theseus
And falsly chaunged hast þow þy name thus
I woll be dede or elles þow shalt dye
Thow shalt nat loue my lady Emelye
But I woll loue hir onely and no mo
ffor I am palamon thy mortall fo
And þough þat I no wepen haue in this place
But out of prison am stert by grace
I drede nat that other þow shalt dye
Or þou ne shalt nat loven Emelye
Chese which þou wolt or þou shalt nat sterte
This Arcite with full dispitous hert
Whan he hym knewe and hade his tale herde
As fers as a lyon pulled out his swerde
And seide thus by god that sitteth aboue
Nere it that þou art seke and wode for loue  
And eke that thow no wepen hast in this place
Thow shuldest neuere out of this greue pace
That thow ne sholdest dyen of my honde
ffor I desire the seurtee and the bonde


Which þat þou seist þat I haue made to the
What verray fole thinke wele that loue is fre
And I woll loue hir maugre all thy might
But for as moch as thow art a knight
And wilnest to darreyn hir by bataill
Haue here my treuthe tomorowe I wyll nat fayll
Without wetyng of ony other wight
That here I woll be founde as a knight
And bryngen harneys righ ynough for the
And chese the best and leue the werst for me
And mete and drynke this night woll I bryng
Ynogh for the and clothes for thy beddyng
And yf so be that þow my lady wynne
And sle me in the wode there I am Inne
Thow maist wele haue thy lady as for me
This palamon answerd and seide I graunte yt the
And thus they ben departed tyll a morowe
Whan ech of hem hade leyde his feythe to borowe
Ocupide out of all charite
O reigne þat wilt no felawe haue with the
ffull soth is seide that loue ne lordship
Will nat hir thankes haue no felawship
Wele fynden that Arcite and palamon
Arcite is ryden anone vnto the toun
And on þe morow er yt were dayes light
ffull priuely ij harneys hathe he dight
Buth suffisant and mete to darreyne
The bataill in the feld bitwex hem tweyne
And on his hors alone as he was born
he carieth all this harneys him byforn
And in the grove at tyme and place yset
This Arcite and palamon ben met
They gan to chaunge colour in her face
Right as the hunters in the reigne of trace
That stonden at the gap with a spere
Whan hunted is the lyon or the bere  

And hereth hym come russhing in the greves
And breketh both bowes and the leves
A thinketh here comth my mortall enemy
withouten fayle he mote be dede or I
ffor outher I mote sle hym at the gap
Or he mot sle me yf that me myshap
So ferden they in chaungyng of her hewe
As fer us euerych of hem other knewe
There was no gode day ne no saluyng
But streight without worde or rehersyng
Euerych of hem helpe to armen other
As frendely as he were his owen brother
And after that with sharpe speres strong
They foynen ecch at other wonder long
Thow myghtest wene that this palamon
In his fightyng were a wode lyon
And as a cruell tygre was Arcite
As wylde bores gan they smyte
That frothen white as fome for ire wode
Vp to the Ancles fyght they in her blode
And in this wyse I lete hem fightyng dwell
And forthe of theseus I will you tell
The desteny ministre generall
That executeth in the world ouer all
The purueaunce that god hath seyn byforn
So stronge it is that though þe werld hade sworn
The contrary of a thing by yee and nay
Yit somtyme yt shall fallen on a day
That falleth nat est within a Ml yere
ffor certeinly our appetites here
Be it of werre or pees or hate or loue
All is this rewled by the sight aboue
This meyne I now by mighty Theseus
That for to hunten ys so desirous
And namely at the grete hert in May
That in his bed þere daweth hym no day


That he nys cladde  and redy for to ride
with hunt and horn and houndes him besyde
ffor in his huntyng hath he soch delite
That yt is all his ioy and appetit  
To ben him self the grete hertes bane
And after Mars he serueth now diane
Clere was the day as I haue tolde or this
And Theseus with all ioy and blis
With his ypolita the feir quene
And Emely clothed all in grene
On huntyng be they riden rially
And to the groue that stode full fast by
In which there was an hert as men him told
Duk Theseus streight the wey hath hold
And to the launde he rideth hym full right
ffor theder was the hert wont haue his flight
And ouer a broke and so forth on his way
This duk woll haue a cours at hym or twey
with soch as that hym lyst comaunde
And whan this duk was com vnto the launde
Vnder the sonne he lokketh and anon
He was ware of Arcite and palamon
That foughten breme as it were bores two
The bright swerdes wenten to and fro
So hidously that with the lest stroke
yt semed as yt wold felle an oke
But what they were no thing he ne wote
This duk his courser with the spores smote
And at a stert he was bitwex hem two
And pulled out a swerde and cried ho
Nomore vpon peyne of lesyng of your hede
By mighty Mars he shall anone be dede
That smyteth ony stroke þat I may seen
But telleth me what mister men ye been
That ben so hardy for to fighten here
withouten Iuge or other officere


As it were in a listes roially
This palamon answerd hastely
And seide sire what nedeth wordes mo
We han deserued the deth both two
Two wofull wrecches ben we and caytyfes
That ben encombred of our owen lyfes
And as þou art a rightfull lord and iuge
Ne yeve vs nother mercy ne refuge  
But sle me first for seint charitee
But sle my felawe eke as wele as me
Or sle hym first for thogh þou know it lyte
This is thy mortall fo this is Arcite
That fro thy lond is banesshed on his hede
ffor which he hath deserued to be dede
ffor this is he that came vnto thy yate
And seide that he hight philostrate
Thus hath he iaped þe full many a yere
And þou hast maked hym thy chief squiere
And this is he that loueth Emely
ffor seth the day is come that I shall dey
I make pleinly my confession
That I am thyk wofull palamon
That hath thy prison broken wykkedly
I am thy mortall fo and yit am I·
That loueth so hote Emelye the bright
That I will dien presens in hir sight
Wherfore I ax deth and my iuwyse
But sle my felawe in the same wyse
ffor both haue we deserued to be sleyn
This worthy duk answerd anone ayein
And seide this is a short conclusyon
your owen mouthe by your confessyon
Hath dampned yow and I woll it recorde
Yt nedeth nought to pyne you with the corde
Ye shall be dede by mighty Mars the rede
The quene anone for verry wommanhede


Gan for to wepe and so did Emelye
And all the ladyes in the cumpanye
Grete pite was yt as yt thoght hem all
That euer soch a chaunce shold fall
ffor gentell men they were of grete astate
And no thing but for loue was this debate
And saugh her blody woundes wyde and sore
And all cryden both las and more
Haue mercy lord vpon vs wemen all
And on her bare knees adoun they fall
And wold haue kist his fete there as he stode
Till at the last aslaked was his mode  
ffor pitee renneth sone in gentell herte
And þough he first for Ire quoke and sterte
He hath considred shortly in a clause
The trespas of hem both and eke the cause
And all though that his Ire her gilt accused
yit in his reason he hem both excused
As thus he thought wele that euery man
woll help hym self in loue yf that he can
And deliuere hym self out of prison
And eke his hert hade compassion
Of wommen for they wepen euery in one
And in his gentle hert he þought anone
And softe vnto hym self he seide fye
Vpon a lord that woll haue no mercy
But ben a lyon both in worde and dede
To hem that ben in repentaunce and drede
As wele as to a proude dispitous man
That woll maintene that he first bygan
That lord hath litell of discrecion
That in soch cas can no deuysion
But weyeth pride and humbles after one
And shortly whan his Ire ys thus agone
He gan to loken vp with yeen light
And spak thise same wordes all on hight


The god of loue a benedicite
How mighty and how grete a lord is he
Ayeinst his might there geyneth none obstacles
He may be cleped a god for his miracles
ffor he kan maken at his owen gyse
Of eueryche hert as that him lust deuyse
Lo here this Arcite and this palamon
That quikly were out of my preson
And might haue leved in Thebes roially
And weten þat I am her mortall enemy
And that her deth lieth in my might also
And yit hath loue maugre her yen two
Brought hem hider both for to dye
Now loketh is nat that an hie folye
Who may ben a fole but yf he loue
Byhold for goddes sake that sitteth aboue
See how they blede be they nat wele arayed  
Thus hath her lord the god of loue payed
Her wages and her fees for her seruice
And yit they wenen for to been full wyse
That seruen loue for ought that may fall
But this ys yit the best game of all
That she for whom they han this iolyte
Konne hem þerfore as moche thanke as me
She wote na more of all this hote fare
By god than wote a Cokkow or an hare
But all mote ben assayed hote and colde
A man mote be a fole outher yong or olde
I wote yt by my self full yore agone
ffor in my tyme a seruaunt was I one
And therfore sen I know of loves peyne
And wote how sore he kan a man destreyne
As he that hath be caught oft in his laas
I yow foryeve all holy this trespaas
At request of the quene that kneleth here
And eke of Emely my suster dere


And ye shall both anone vnto me swere
That neuer mo ye shall my cuntrey dere
Ne make werre vp on me night ne day
But be my frendes in all that ye may
I you foryeve this trespase euerydele
And they hym sworen his askyng feire and wele
And hym of lordship and mercy preyde
And hem graunteth grace and than he seyde
To speke of royall lynage and richesse
Though that she were a quene or a princesse
Ecch of you both is worthy doutles
To wedden whan tyme is but natheles
I speke as for my suster Emelye
ffor whom ye haue this stryfe and ielousye
Ye wote your self she may nat wedden two
At ones though ye fighten euermo
That one of you all be hym loth or leef
He mot go pype in an Ivy leef
This is to seyn she may nat now haue both
All be you neuer so ielous ne so wrothe
And forthy I you put in this degree
That ecch of you shall haue his destenye  
As hym is shape and herkeneth in what wyse
lo here your ende of that I shall devyse
My will is this for plat conclusyon
Without ony replicacyon
Yf that you liketh take it for the best
That euerych of you shall gone where hym lest
ffrely withouten raunsoun or daunger
And this day L wekes fer ne ner
Euerych of you shall bryng an C knightes
Armed for lystes vp at all rightes
All redy to darreyne her bataill
And this byhote I you withouten fayle
Vpon my trewth and as I am a knight
That whether of you both that hath might


This is to seyn that whether he or thow
May with his C as I spake of now
Sleen his contrarye or out of lystes dryve
Than shall I yeve Emelye to wyve
To whom that fortune yeveth so feire a grace
The lystes shall I maken in this place
And god so wysly on my soule rewe
As I shall even Iuge been and trewe
Ye shall none other ende with me maken
Þat that one of you ne shall be dede or taken
And you think that this be wele ysayde
Seith your avys and holdeth yow apayde
This is your ende and your conclusyon
Who loketh lightly now but palamon
Who spryngeth for ioy but Arcite
Who kouth telle or who kouth it endite
The ioy that is maked in the place
Whan Theseus hath done so feire a grace
But doun on knees went euery maner wight
And thonked him with all her hert and might
And namely the Thebans oft sythe
And thus with gode hope and hert blythe
They take her leve and homeward gon they ryde
To Thebes with his olde walles wyde
i trowe men wolde deme yt necgligence
Yf I foryete to tellen the dispence  
Of Theseus that gothe so besely
That maken vp the lystes roially
That soch a noble teatre as yt was
I dare wele seyn in this world there nas
The circuite a myle was aboute
Walled of stone and dyched all withoute
Rounde was the shap in manere of a compaas


ffull of degrees the height of lx paas
That whan a man was set on o degree
He letted nat his felaw for to see
Estward there stode a gate of marbyll white
Westward right soch an other in the opposyte
And shortly to concluden soch a place
Was none in erthe as in so litell a space
ffor in the londe there was no crafty man
That geometrye or ars metryk can
Ne portreyour ne kerver of ymages
That Theseus ne yaf mete and wages
The teatre for to maken and devyse
And for to done his right and sacrifise
He Estward hath vp on the gate aboue
In worshippe of venus goddes of loue
Done made an Awter and an oratorye
And westward in memorie
Of Mars he hath maked soch an other
That cost largely of gold a fother
And Northward in a Toret on the wall
Of Alabastre white and rede corall
An oratorye riche for to see
In worshippe of Dyane the chastitee
Hath Theseus done wrought in a noble wyse
But yit hade I forgeten to deuyse
The noble kervyng and the purtratures
The shape the countenance and the figures
That weren in thise oratories thre
ffirst in the temple of venus maist þou se
wroght on the wall full pitous to beholde
The broken slepes and the sighes colde
The sacred teres and the weymentyng
The verey strokes of the desiryng  
That loue seruauntes in this lyf enduren
The othes that her couenauntes assuren
Plesaunce and hope desire full hardynes


Beaute youth bawdrye and riches
Charmes and force lesynges flaterie
Dispence besynes and ielousye
That wered of yelow gooldes a garland
And a cukkow sittyng on hir hand
ffeestes instrumentes caroles daunces
Lust and array  and alle the circumstaunces
Of loue  which þat I rekened  and reken shalle
Be ordre weren peynted  on the walle
And moo than I can make of  mencion
ffor sothly  al the Mount of Sytheron
There venus hath  hire principal dwellyng
was shewed on the wal  in portraiyng
with al the gardeyn  and the lustynesse
Nat was forȝeten  the porter Idelnesse
Ne Narsisus  the faire  of ȝore agon
Ne ȝet the folie  of kyng Salamon
Ne ȝet the gret strengthe  of Hercules
The enchauntement  of Medea and Circes
Ne of Turnus  with the hardy fiers corage
The riche Cresus  kaytif in seruage
  Thus may ȝe sen  þat wysdom ne richesse
Beaute ne sleight  strengthe hardynesse
Ne may with venus  maken champertye
ffor as hire lust  þe world þanne may she gye
loo all þeise folk  so caught were in hire laas
Til they for woo  ful often seid allas
  Suffisith here  ensamples on or two
And ȝet I koude reken  a Ml  mo
The statute of venus  glorious for to se
was naked  fletyng in the large see
And fro the nauyl doun  al couered was
with waughes grene  and bright as eny glas
A Citole  in hire right hand  had she
And on hire hede  ful semely for to se
A Rose garlond  fressh and wel smellyng


Abouen hire hede  hire dowes flekeryng
Biforn hire stod  hir sone Cupido
Vpon hise shuldres  wynges had he two
And blynd he was  as it is oft sene
A bowe he bar  and arwes bright and kene
  why shuld I nat eke  as wel telle ȝow all
The portrature  þat was vpon the wall
withInne the temple  of myghty Mars the rede
Al peynted was the wal  in lengthe and brede
lyke to the Estres  of the grisly place
That hight the gret temple of Mars in Trace
In thilk cold frosty  region
There as Mars  hath his souereigne mansion  
ffirst on the wal  was peynted a forest
In which there dwelleth  neiþer man ne best
with knotty knarry  barreyne trees olde
Of stubbes sharpe  and hedous to byholde
In which there ran  a rombel in a swough
As though a storme  shulde bresten euery bough
And dounward from an hille  vnder a bent
There stode a temple  of Mars Armypotent
wrought al of borned stele  of which the entree
was long and streyt  and gastly for to se
 And þereouȝt cam a rage  and swich a veȝe
That it mad al the gate  for to rese
The northern light  in at the dores shone
ffor wyndowe on the wal  ne was þere none
Thorugh which men myghten  eny light discerne
The dore was al  of Athamant eterne
Iclenched ouerthwert  and endlong
with Iren tough  and for to make it strong
Euery piller  the temple to sustene
was tonne gret of Iren  bright and shene
  There saw I first  the derk ymagenynge
Of felonye  and al the compassynge
The cruel  Ire  red as eny glede


The pyke purs  and eke the pale drede
The smylere with þe knyf  vnder the cloke
The shippen brennyng  with the blak smoke
The treson of the morderynge  in the bedde
The open werre  with woundes al bebledde
Conteke with blody knyf  and sharp manace
Al ful of chidyng  was this sory place
The sleere of him self  ȝet saugh I there
his hert blode  hath bathed al his heere
The nail Idreuen  in the shode anyght
The colde deth  with mouth gapyng vpright
  A myddes of the temple  sat myschaunce
with discomfort  and sory countenaunce
Ȝet saugh I woodnes  laughyng in his rage
Armed  compleynt  ouȝthees  and fiers outrage
The careyne in þe bussh  with throte koruen
A  Ml  sleyn  and nouȝt of qualme Istoruen
The teraunt with the pray  by force Iraft
The Toun destroied  þere was no þing Ilaft
Ȝet saugh I brent  the shippes hoppesteres
The honte strangelid  with the wylde beres
The Sowe freetyng the child  right in the Cradel  
The koke Iskaldede  for al his longe ladel
Nouȝt was forȝeten  by þe infortune of Marte
The Cartere ouerryden  with his carte
Vnder the whele  ful lowe he lay adoun
There were also  of Martes deuysion
The Barbour  and the Bocher  and the Smyth
That forgeth sharpe swerdes  on the styth
  And al aboue  depeynted in a Tour
Saugh I conquest  sittyng in gret honour
with the sharp swerde  ouer his hede
hangyng  by a sotel twyned threde
Depeynted was the slauȝter  of Iulius
Of gret Nero  and of Anthonius
Allebe þat thilke tyme  they were vnborn


Ȝet was here deth  depeynted þere biforn
By manassyng of Mars  right be figure
So was it shewed  in that portrature
As is depeynted  in the sertres aboue
who shal be slayn  or elles ded for loue
Suffiseth on ensaumple  in stories olde
I may nat rekken hem alle  though I wolde
  The statute of Mars  vp on a carte stode
Armed and loked grym  as he were wode
And ouer his hed  þere shynen two figures
Of stories  þat ben cleped  in scriptures
That on Puella  that other Rubeus
This god of armes  was arayed thus
A wolf þere stode  biforn him at his fete
with eyen rede  and of a man he ete
with sotil pencelles  was depeynted þis storie
In redoutyng of Mars  and of his glorie
  Now to the Temple  of Diane the chaste
As shortly as I can  I wyl me haste
To tellen ȝow  of the discripcion
Depeynted by the walles  vp and doun
Of huntyng  and of shamefast chastite
There saugh I  how wooful Calistope
whan þat Diane  agreued was with hire
was turned fro a womman  to a Beere
and aftir was she mad  þe lode sterre
Thus was it peynted  I can sey ȝow no ferre
Hire sone is eke  a sterre as men may se
There saugh I Dane  turned to a tre
I mene nat  the goddes Diane
But Penneus doughter  which þat hight Dane  
There saugh I Atheon  an hert Imaked
ffor vengeaunce þat he saugh  Diane al naked
I saw how þat hise houndes  han him caught
And fretyn him  for þat þei knew him naught
Ȝet peynted was  a litel forthermore


how Atthalaunce  honted the wylde bore
And Meleagre  and many an other moo
ffor which  Diane  wrouȝt hem care and woo
There saw I many a noþer  wonder story
The which me list nat drawe  to memory
This goddesse on an hert  ful heye sette
with smale houndes  al aboute hire fete
And vndirnethe hire feet  she had a Mone
waxyng it was  and shulde vanysshe sone
In gaude grene  hire stature clothed was
with bow in hond  and arwes in a cas
hire eyen cast she  ful lowe adoun
There Pluto hath  his derke region
A womman trauaillyng  was hire biforn
But for hire child  so longe was vnborn
fful pytously Lucyna  gan she calle
And seide help  for þou maist best of alle
wel coude he peynt lifly  that it wrought
with many a floreyn  he the hewes bought
  Now ben theise lystes mad  and Theseus
That at his gret cost  arrayed thus
The temples  and the teatre euery dele
Whan it was don  him liked wonder wele
But stynte I wyl  of Theseus a lyte
And speke of Palamon  and of Arcite
  The day approcheth  of here returnynge
That euerych shulde  an  C  knyghtis brynge
The bataylle to darreyne  as I ȝow told
And to Athenes  here couenaunt for to hold
hath euerych of hem  brought an  C  knyghtes
wel armed for the werre  at alle rightes
And sekerly  there trowed many a man
That neuere sithen  þat the world bygan
As for to speke  of knyghthod of here hond
As fer as god hath maked  see and lond
Nas of so fewe  so noble a companye


ffor euerych wyght  þat loued cheualrye
And wold his thankes  han a passaunt name
Hath preyed þat he myght  ben of that game  
And wel was him  that therto chosen was
ffor if there fel  tomorwen swich a kaas
Ȝe knowen wele  that euery lusty knyght
That loueth paramours  and hath his myght
Were it in Engelond  or elles where
They wolde here thankes  wyllen to be there
To fighten for a lady  benedicite
It were a lusty sight  for to se
  And right so ferden they  with Palamon
with him there went  knyghtes many on
Some wold ben armed  in haberioun
And in a breestplate  and a light Iepoun
And some wold haue  a peyre plates large
And some wold haue  a spruce sheld and targe
And some wold ben armed  on hise legges wele
And haue an Ax  and some a mace of stele
There nys no newe gyse  þat it nas old
Armed were they  as I haue ȝow told
Euerych after  hise opynion
  There maist þou se  comyng with Palamon
lygurge him self  the grete kyng of Trace
Blak was his berd  and manly was his face
The sercles of hise eyen  in his hede
They gloweden  betwix ȝelwe and rede
And like a griffon  loked he aboute
with kempe heeres  on hise browes stoute
hys lymes grete  hise braunes hard and strong
his shuldres brode  his armes grete and long
And as the gyse was  in his contre
fful heye  vp on a chayer of gold  stod he
with foure white Boles  in the trays
In stede of Cotearmure  ouer his harneys
with nayles ȝelwe  and bright as eny gold


he had a beres skyn  cole blak for old
his long her  was kembed behynde his bak
As ony rauenes fether  it shone for blak
A wrethe of gold  arme gret  of huge weyght
Vp on his hede  and ful of stones bryght
Of fyne Rubies  and Diamauntes
Abouten his chaier  there went white alauntes
Twenty and mo  as grete as ony stere
To honten at the lyon  or the deere
And folwed him  with mosellis faste Ibounde
Colered of gold  and torettes fyled rounde
An C lordes  had he in his route  
Armed ful wele  with wertes sterne and stoute
  with Arcita  in stories as men fynde
The grete Emytrius  the kyng of Inde
vpon a steede Bay  trapped in stel
Couered with a cloth of gold  dyapred wel
Cam ridyng lyke the god  of armes Mars
His Cotearmure  was of cloth of Tars
Couched with perles  white rounde and grete
his sadel was of brent gold  newe Ibete
A mantelet  vpon his shulder hangyng
Bret ful of Rubies  rede as fir sparkelyng
his crispe heer  lyke rynges was Ironne
And that was ȝelwe  and gletered as the sonne
His nose was hey  his eyen bright Citryn
His lippes rounde  his colour was sangwyn
A fewe fraknes  in his face Ispreynt
Betwixen ȝelwe  and somdel blak Imeynt
And as a lyon  he his lokyng caste
Of xxvti ȝere  his age I caste
His berd was wel bygonne  for to springe
his throte was as a trompe  thonderynge
Vpon his hede  he wered a loirrer grene
ffressh and lusty  ffor to sene
Vpon his hand he bar  for his deduyt


An Egle tame  as ony lilly whyt
An C  lordes  had he with him there
Alle armed saue here hedes  in al here gere
fful richely  in alle manere thynges
ffor trosteth wele  that Dukes Erles kynges
were gadred  in this noble companye
ffor loue and for encres  of chyualrye
Aboute this kyng  þere ran on euery part
fful many a tame lyon  and leopart
  And in this wyse  þeise lordes alle and Some
Ben on the Sonday  to the Cite come
Aboute prime  and in the Toun alight
This Theseus þis Duke  this worthy knyght
whan he had brouȝt hem  into his Citee
And Inned euerych of hem  at his degree
He festeth hem  and doth so gret labour
To esen hem  and don hem all honour
That ȝet man wenen  þat no mannys wytte
Of none astate  ne coude amenden ytte
  The mynstralsie  the seruyse at the feest
The grete ȝiftes  to the most and lest  
The riche aray  of Theseus paleys
Ne who sat first ne last  vp on the deys
what ladies fairest ben  and best daunsynge
Or which of hem  kan best daunce or synge
Ne who most feynyngly  speketh of loue
what haukes seten  on the perches aboue
what houndes liggen  on the flore adoune
Of al this  make I no mencion
But al þe effect  that thynketh me the best
Now cometh the poynt  herkeneth if ȝow lest
  The Sonday nyght  or day bygan to springe
whan Palamon  the lark herde synge
al though it nere nat day  by houres two
Ȝet song the lark  and Palamon right tho
with holy hert  and hey corage


He rod to wenden  on his pilgrimage
Vnto the blisseful  Sitheria benigne
I mene venus  honurable and digne
And in hire houre  he walketh forth a paas
Vnto the lystes  there hire temple was
And doun he kneleth  and with humble chere
And herte soor  he seide as ȝe shuln here
Fairest of fair  O lady myn  venus
Doughter to Ioue  and spouse to vulcanus
Thow glader  of þe mounte of Scitheron
ffor thilke loue  þou haddest  to Adoon
Haue pyte  of my bytter teres smerte
And take myn humble preyer  at thyn herte
Allas I ne haue  no langage to telle
The effect  and the turmentȝ of myn helle
Myn hert may nat  myn harmes bywrye
I am so sorweful  that I can nat seye
But mercy lady bright  that knowest wele
My thought  and seest what harmes þat I fele
Considre al this  and rewe vpon my sore
As wysly  as I shal for euere more
Perfourmyng be my myght  thy trewe seruaunt to be
And holden werre alwey  with chastite
That make I myn avow  so ȝe me helpe
I kepe nat of armes  for to ȝelpe
Ne I ne ask nouȝt tomorwe  to han victorie
Ne renon in this caas  ne veyn glorie
Of prys of armes  blowen vp and doun
But I wold haue fully  possession
Of Emelie  and dye in thy seruyse  
ffynde þou the maner  and in what wyse
I recche nat  but it may better be
Than victorie  of hem  or they of me
So that I haue my lady  in myne armes
ffor though so be  that Mars is god of armes
Ȝoure vertu is so gret  in heuene aboue


That if ȝow list  I shal wel haue my loue
Thy temple wol I worshipe  euere mo
And on thyn auter  where I ride or go
I wyl don sacrifise  and fires bete
And if ȝe wyl nat so  my lady swete
Than preye I the  tomorwe with a spere
That Arcita me  thorugh þe hert bere
Than rekke I nought  whan I haue lost my lif
Though þat Arcita  wynne hire to his wyf
This is the effect  and ende of my preyere
Ȝeue me my lyf  þou blisseful lady dere
  whan þat the orison  was don of Palamon
His sacrifise he dide  and that anon
fful pitously  with alle the circumstaunceȝ
Alle telle i nat  as now  his obseruaunceȝ
But at the laste  the stature of venus shoke
And made a signe  wherby þat he toke
That his prayer  accepted was that day
ffor though the signe  shewed a delay
Ȝet wist he wele  that graunted was his bone
And with glad herte  he went him hom ful sone
THe thridde houre  inequall þat Palamon
Began to venus temple  for to gon
vp ros the sonne  and vp ros Emelye
And to the temple of Diane  gan hye
Hire maydenes  þat she thidder with hire ladde
fful redily with hem  the fyr they hadde
The encence  the clothes  and the remenaunt alle
That to the sacrefice  longen shalle
The hornes ful of mede  as was the gyse
There lakked nouȝt  to don hire sacrefise
Smokyng the temple  ful of clothes faire
This Emelye  with herte debonaire
hir body vessh  with water of a welle
But how she dide  hir rite  I dar nat telle
But it be ony thyng  in general


And ȝete it were  a game  to heren al  
To him þat meneth wel  it were no charge
But it is good  a man ben at his large
hire bright heer was kembed  vntressed all
A corone of a grene Oke  seriall
Vpon hire hed was set  ful fair and mete
Two fires vpon the auter  gan she bete
And dide hire thynges  as men may byholde
In stace of Thebes  and othere bokes olde
whan kynled was the fyr  with pytous chere
Vnto Diane she spak  as ȝe may here
O chast goddesse  of the wodes grene
To whom  bothe heuen  erthe  and see  ys sene
Quene of the regne of Pluto  Derk and lowe
Goddesse of Maydenes  that myn hert hast knowe
fful many a ȝere  and wost what I desire
As kepe me fro thy vengeaunce  and thyn Ire
That Antheon  abought cruelly
Chaste goddesse  wel wost thow that I
Desire to be a Mayden  al my lif
Ne neuere wyl I be  no loue  ne wyf
I am þou wost ȝet  of thy companye
A Maide  and loue huntyng and venerie
And for to walken  in the wodes wyld
And nat to ben a wyf  and be with child
Nought wol I knowe  companye of man
Now help lady  sith ȝe may and kan
ffor tho thre formes  that þou hast in the
And Palamon  that hath swich loue to me
And eke Arcite  that loueth me so sore
This grace I preye the  withoute more
As send loue and pes  betwix hem two
And fro me turne awey  here hertes so
That al here hot loue  and here desire
And alle here besy turmenteȝ  and here fire
Be quenched  and turned  in another place


And if so be  þou wylt nat do me grace
Of if my destenye  be Ishape so
That I shal nedes haue  on of hem two
As send me him  that most desireth me
Byhold goddesse  of clene chastite
The bitter teres  that on my chekys falle
Syn þou art Mayde  and kepere of vs alle
My maydenhode þou kepe  and wel conserue
And while I lyue  a Mayde I wol the serue  
  The fires brennen  vpon the auter clere
while Emelye  was thus  in hire preyere
But sodeynly she sey  a sight queynte
ffor right anon  on of the fires queynte
And quyked ageyn  and after that anon
That other fir was queynt  and al agon
And as it queynt  it made a whistelyng
As don theise wete brondes  in here brennyng
And at the brondes ende  ouȝt ran anon
As it were blody dropes  many on
ffor which so sore agast  was Emelye
That she was wol ny mad  and gan to crye
ffor she ne wyst  what it signified
But only for the feer  thus hath she cried
And wepte  þat it was pite for to here
  And therwithal  Diane gan apere
with bowe in hond  right as an huntresse
And seide doughter  stynt thyn heuynesse
Among the goddes hie  it is afermed
And by eterne word  wryten and confermed
Thow shalt ben wedded  vnto on of tho
That han for the  so meche care and woo
But vnto which of hem  I may nat telle
ffare wel  I may no lengere dwelle
The fires which  that on myn auter brenne
Shuln the declaren  er that þow go henne
Thyn auenture of loue  as in this caas


And with þat word  the arwes in the caas
Of the goddesse  clateren faste and rynge
And forth she went  and mad a vanasshynge
ffor which this Emelye  astoyned was
And seide  what amountith this  allas
I putte me  in thyn proteccion
Diane  and in thyn disposicion
And hom she goth anon  the next wey
This is the effect  there is no more to sey
  The next houre  of Mars  folwyng this
Arcite  vnto the temple  walked is
Of fiers Mars  to don his sacrefice
with alle the rightes  of his payen wyse
with pitous hert  and hie deuocion
O Ryght thus to Mars  he seid his orison
Strong god  that in the regnes cold
Of Trace  honoured art  and god Ihold
And hast in euery regne  and euery lond  
Of armes  alle the brydeles in þin hond
And hem fortunest  as the list deuyse
Accepte of me  my pitous sacrifise
If so be  that my ȝouthe  may deserue
And þat my myght  be worthy for to serue
Thyn godhed  that I may be on of thyne
Than preye I the  to rewe vpon my pyne
ffor thilk pyne  and thilk hote fyre
In which  þou whilom  brendest for desire
whan that þou vsedest  the beaute
Of fair ȝong and fressh  Venus fre
And haddest hire in armes  at thy wylle
Although the ones  on a tyme mysfelle
whan Vulcanus  had caught the in his laas
And fond the liggynge  by his wyf  Allas
ffor thilk sorwe  that was tho in thyn hert
Haue reuthe as wel  vpon my peynes smert
I am ȝong  and vnkonyng  as þou wost


And as I trowe  with loue offended most
That euere was ony  lyues creature
ffor she þat doth me  al this woo endure
Ne reccheth neuere  wheiþer I synke or flete
And wel I wot  or she me mercy hete
I mot with strengthe  wynne hire in the place
And wel I wot  withouten help and grace
Of the  ne may my strengthe  nat availle
Than help me lord  tomorwe in my bataille
ffor thilk fire  that whilom brent the
As wele as thilk fire  now brenneth me
And do þat I tomorwe  may han victorie
Myn be the trauaylle  and thyn be the glorie
Thy souereygne temple  wyl I most honoure
Of ony place  and alwey most laboure
In thy plesaunce  and in thy craftes strong
And in thy temple  I wol my baner hong
And alle the armes  of my companye
And euere mo  vnto that day I dye
Eterne fyre  I wyl byfore the fynde
And eke to this avow  I wyl me bynde
My berd myn her  þat hangeth long adoun
That neuere ȝet felte  nor offension
Of Rasour ne of shere  I wyl the ȝeue
And ben thyn trewe seruaunt  whyl I lyue
Now lord haue reuthe  vpon my sorwes sore  
Ȝeue me the victorie  I aske the no more
  The prayer stynt  of Arcita the strong
The rynges of the temple dore  þat hong
And eke the dores  clateren ful faste
Of which Arcita  somwhat him agaste
The fires brent  vpon the auter bryght
That it gan  al the temple for to light
A swete smel  anon  þe ground vp ȝaue
And Arcita anon  his hand vp haue
And more encens  into the fyr he cast


with othere riȝtes mo  and at the last
  The statute of Mars  bygan his hauberk rynge
And with þat soun  he herd a murmurynge
fful lowe and dym  and seide thus  victorie
ffor which  he ȝaf to Mars  honour and glorie
  And thus with ioye  and hope wel to fare
Arcite anon  vnto his In is fare
As fayn as foul  is of the bryght sonne
And right anon  swich a strif  þere is bygonne
ffor thilke grauntyng  in þe heuene aboue
Betwix venus  the goddesse of loue
And Mars  the sterne god armypotent
That Iubiter was besy  it to stent
Til þat the pale  Saturnus  the colde
That knew so manye  of auentures olde
ffond in his old experience  and art
That the ful sone  hath plesed euery part
As soth is seid  elde hath gret auauntage
In elde is bothe wysdom  and vsage
Men may the olde at renne  and nat at rede
Saturne anon  to stynten stryf and drede
Al be it  þat it is  ageyn his kynde
Of al this strif  he can remedye fynde
  My dere doughter Venus  quod Saturne
My cours  that hath so wyde  for to turne
Hath more powere  than wot ony man
Myn is the drenchyng  in the see so wan
Myn is the pryson  in the derke Cote
Myn is the strangelyng  and hangyng by the throte
The murmur  and the cherles rebellyng
The groynyng  and the pryue enpoysenyng

While I dwelle in þe signe  of the lyon
Myn is the ruyne  of the heye halles
The fallyng of the Toures  and of the walles  
Vpon the Mynour  or the Carpentere


I slow Sampson  shakyng the pylere
And myne ben  the maladyes colde
The derk treson  and the castes olde
My lokyng is  the fader of pestilence
Now wepe no more  I shal don diligence

Shal haue his lady  as þou hast him hight
This Mars  shal helpe his knyght ȝet  natheles
Betwix ȝow  there mot  be som tyme pees
Al be ȝe nat  of oo compleccion
That causeth al day swich deuysion
I am thyn al redy  at thy wylle
wepe now no more  I wol thy lust fulfille
Now wol I stynt  of the goddes aboue
Of Mars and of Venus  goddesse of loue
And tellen ȝow  as pleynly as I can
The grete effect  for which þat I bygan
Gret was the fest  at Athenes that day
And eke the lusty seson  of that May
Made euery wyght  to ben in swich plesance
That al that Monday  Iusten they and daunce
And spenden it  in venus hey seruyse
And by the cause  that they shulden ryse
Erly for to sen  the grete sight
vnto here reest  went they at nyght
And on þe morwe  whan the day gan spryng
Of hors and harneys  noyse and clateryng
There was  in hostryes al aboute
And to the Paleys  rod þere many a route
Of lordes  vpon stedes and palfreyes
  There maist þou sen  deuysyng of harneys
So vnkouth  and so riche  and wrouȝt so wele
Of goldsmythrie  of browdyng and of stele


The sheldes bright  testres and trappures
Gold hewen helmes  hauberkes Cotearmures
Lordes in parmentis  or here courseres
knyghtes of retenue  and eke squyeres
Naylyng the speres  and helmes bokelyng
Gynggynge of sheldes  with layneres lassyng
There as nede is  they were no thyng Idel
The fomy steedes  on the goldene brydel
Gnawyng  and faste the armures also
with fyle and hamer  prykyng to and fro
Ȝemen on fote  and comunes many on  
with shorte staues  thikke as they may gon
Pipes  trompes  Nakeres Clariones
That in the bataill  blowen blody sownes
The paleys ful of peeple  vp and doun
here thre  there x holdyng here question
Diuynyng of theise Thebans  knyghtes two
Somme seyden thus  som seyden it shal be so
Somme heldyn with him  with the blak berde
Some with the balled  some with the thikke herede
Somme seide he loked grym  and he wold fyght
he hath a sparthe  of twenty pound of wyght
Thus was the halle  ful of dyuynyng
longe after the sonne  gan vp spryng
  The grete Theseus  of his slep awaked
with mynstralsie  and noise þat was maked
he held ȝet the chaumbres  of his paleys riche
Til þat the Thebans knyghtes  bothe Iliche
Houndred  weren into the paleys fet
Duke Theseus  is at the wyndowe set
Arrayed  right as he were  a god in trone
The peeple preseth  thederward ful sone
Hym for to sen  and don hey reuerence
And eke to herken  his hest  and his sentence
  An heraud on a skaffold  made an oo
Til al the noyse of the peeple  was Ido


And whan he saw  the peeple of noyse al stille
Thus shewed he  the myghty Dukes wylle
  The lord hath  of heye discrecion
Considered  that it were destruccion
To gentil blode  to fighten in the gyse
Of mortal bataille  now in this emprise
wherfore to shapen  that they shal nat deye
he wol his ffirst purpos  modifie
  No man þerfore  vp peyne of losse of lyf
No maner shote  ne pollax  ne short knyf
Into the lystes sende  or theder bryng
No short swerd for to steke  with poynt bityng
Ne noman ne drawe  ne bere it by his syde
Ne noman shal  vnto his felawe ryde
But oo cours  with a sharp Igrounde spere
ffoyne if him list  on fote him self to were
And he þat is at myschef  shal be take
And nouȝt slayn  but be brouȝt vnto þe stake
That shal ben ordeyned  on eyther syde
And thidder he shal by force  and there abyde  
And if so falle  that the cheuenteyn be take
On either syde  or elles sle his make
No lengere shal  the turnayng laste
God spede ȝow go forth  and ley on faste
with long swerd and with mace  fighteth ȝoure fille
Go now ȝoure wey  this is the lordes wylle
  The voys of þe peeple  toucheth the heuene
So loude crieden they  with mery steuene
God saue swich a lord  þat is so good
he ne wyl  no destruccion of blod
 Vp gon the trumpes  and the melodye
And to the lystes  riȝt the cumpanye
By ordinaunce  þorughouȝt the Citee large
Honged with cloth of gold  and nat with sarge
fful lyke a lord  this noble Duke gan ryde
Theise two Thebans  vpon either side


And after rod the Quene  and Emelye
And after that  another companye
Of on and other  after here degree
And thus they passen  thorughouȝt the Citee
And to the lystes  come they be tyme
It nas nouȝt of the day  ȝet fully pryme
  Whan set was Theseus  ful riche and heye
ypolita the Quene  and Emelye
And other ladies  in degrees aboute
Vnto the setes  preseth euery route
And westward  þorugh the gates  vnder Marte
Arcite  and eke the C  of his parte
with baner red  is entred right anon
  And in þat selue moment  Palamon
Is vnder venus  estward in the place
with baner whit  and hardy chere and face
In al the world  to seken vp and doun
So euene  withoute variacion
There ne is  swich companyes twey
ffor there was non  so wys þat koude sey
That any had  of other auauntage
Of worthynesse  ne of estate ne Age
So euen were they  chosen for to gesse
And in two renges  faire they hem dresse
whan þat here names  red were euerychon
That in here noumbre  gyle were þere non
Tho were the gates shette  and cried was loude
Do now ȝoure deuer  ȝonge knyghtes proude
  The heraudes left here prekyng  vp and doun
Now ryngen trompes loude  and Clarioun
There nys nomore to sey  but west and Est  
In gon the speres  ful sadly in the rest
In goth the sharp spore  into the syde
Þere se men who can Iuste  and who can ryde
They sheueren shaftes  vpon sheldes thikke
he feleth þorugh the hert spone  the prikke


Vp springen speres  xxti fote on height
Ouȝt gon the swerdes  as the siluer bright
The helmes they tohewen  and toshrede
Ouȝt brest the blod  with sterne stremes rede
with myghty maces  to bons they  tobrest
he þorugh the thikkest  of the throng gan threst
There stomblen steedes strong  and doun goth al
He rolleth vnder fote  as doth a bal
He foyneth on his fet  with his tronchon
And he him hurteth  with his hors adoun
he thurgh the body is hurt  and sithen take
Maugre his hede  and brouȝt vnto the stake
As forward was  and þere he must abyde
Another lad is  on þat other syde
And som tyme  doth Theseus  to reste
hem  to refresshe  and drynken if hem liste
  fful ofte a day  han theise Thebans two
Togeder mette  and wrouȝt his felawe woo
Vnhorsed hath ech other  of hem tweye
There nas no Tygre  in the vale of Galgopheye
whan þat hire whelp were stole  whan it is lite
So cruel on the hunte  as is Arcite
ffor ielous hert  vpon this Palamon
Ne in belmarie  there nys no fel lyon
That hunted is  or for his honger wood
Ne of his pray  desireth so the blod
As Palamon  to slen his foo Arcite
The ielous strokes  on here helmes byte
Ouȝt ronneth blod  on both here sides rede
  Somtyme an ende þere is  of euery dede
ffor er the sonne  vnto the rest went
The strong kyng  Emetrius  gan hent
This Palamon  as he faught with Arcite
And mad his swerd depe  in his flessh to byte
And by the force of xxti  is he take
vnȝolden  and Idrawen  vnto the stake


And in the rescuys  of þis Palamon
The strong kyng lygurge  is born adoun
And kyng Emetrius  for al his strengthe
Is born ouȝt of his sadel  a swerd lengthe  
So hit him Palamon  er he were take
But al for nought  he was brouȝt to þe stake
his hardy hert  myght him help right nought
he must abide  whan that he was caught
By force  and eke by composicion
  who sorweth now  but wooful Palamon
That mot no more  gon ageyn to fight
And whan that Theseus  had seyn þis sight
Vnto the folk  that foughten thus echon
He cried hoo no more  for it is don
I wol be trewe Iugge  and no partie
Arcite of Thebes  shal haue Emelie
That by his fortune  hath hire faire Iwonne
Anon there is a noyse  of peeple bygonne
ffor ioye of this  so loude and hye withalle
It semed that the listes  shulde falle
  what can now  fayr venus don aboue
what seith she now  what doth this Quene of loue
But wepeth so  wantyng of hire wylle
Til that hire teres  in the listes felle
She seide  I am ashamed douteles
  Saturnus seide  doughter hold þin pes
Mars hath his wylle  his knyght hath al his bone
And be myn hede  þou shalt ben eesed sone
The trompoures  with the loude Mynstralsye
The heraudes  that ful loude  ȝelle and crye
Ben in here wele  for Ioye of Daun Arcite
But herkeneth now  and stynteth noyse a lite
which a miracle  there fel anon
This fiers Arcite  hath of his helm don
And on a Courser  for to shewe his face
he preketh endlong  the large place


lokyng vpward  vpon this Emelye
And she ageyn him cast  a frendly eye

They folowe all þe fauour of fortune  
And she was al his cher  as in his herte
Ouȝt of the ground  a fire infernel sterte
ffro Pluto sent  at the request of Saturne
ffor which  his hors for fer  gan to turne
And lepte aside  and foundred as he lepe
And er that Arcite  may taken kepe
he pyght him on the pomel  of his hede
That in the place  he lay as he were ded
his brest tobrosten  with his sadel bowe
As blak he was  as ony cole or crowe  
So was the blode  Ironnen in his face
  Anon he was born  ouȝt of the place
With hert sore  to Theseus paleys
Tho was he coruen  ouȝt of his harneys
And in a bed Ibrought  ful fair and blyue
ffor he was ȝet  in memorie and lyue
And alwey criyng  after Emelye
Duke Theseus  with al his companye
Is comen hom  to Athenes his Citee
With all blisse  and gret solempnyte
Al be it  that this auenture was falle
He nolde nat  discomforten hem alle
Men seide eke  Arcite shal nat deye
he shal ben heled  of his maladye
And of anoþer thyng  they were as fayn
That of hem alle  was non Islayn
Alle were they sore Ihurt  and namely on
That with a spere was thirled  þorugh þe brest bon
To oþere woundes  and to broken armes
Somme hadden salue  and somme hadden charmes
ffermacies of herbes  and eke saue
They dronken  for þei wold here lyues haue


ffor which this noble Duke  as he wel can
Comforteth  and honoureth  euery man
And mad reuel  al the longe nyght
Vnto the straunge lordes  as was right
  Ne there was holden  non discomfityng
But as a Iustes  or a turneyeng
ffor sothly there was  no disconfiture
ffor fallyng nys nat  but an auenture
Ne to ben had by force  vnto the stake
Vnȝolden  and with  xxti  knyghtes take
O persone alone  withouten mo
And haried forth  by arm foot and too
And eke his steede  dreuen forth with staues
With fotmen  bothe ȝemen and eke knaues
It nas aretted him  no velanye
There may no man  clepe it cowardie
  ffor which anon  Duke Theseus let crie
To stynten al rancour  and Envie
The gree as wele  of o side as of other
And either side elyke  as others brother
And ȝaf hem ȝiftes  after here degree
And fully held a fest  dayes thre
And conueyed the kyngis  worthily
Ouȝt of his toun  a iourne largely  
And hom went euery man  the right wey
There was no more  but fare wel haue good day
Of this bataille  I wol no more endyte
But speke of Palamon  and of Arcite
Swelleth the brest of Arcite  and the sore
Encreseth  at his hert  more and more
The clotered blod  for ony lechecraft
Corupteth  and is in his bouke Ilaft
That neither veyn blod  ne ventusyng
Ne drynk of herbes  may ben his helpyng
The vertue of explyf  or Animall
ffor thilk vertue  cleped naturall


Ne may the venym voide  ne expelle
The pipes of his longen  gonen swelle
And euery lacerte  in his brest adoun

Him gayneth nought to gete his lyf
Vomyt vpward ne donward laxatyf
All is brosten þat regioun  
Nature hath now  no dominacion
And certeynly  there nature wyl nat werche
ffare wel Phisyk  go bere þe man to cherche
This is al and som  that Arcite mot deye
ffor which he sendeth  after Emelye
And Palamon  that was his Cosyn dere
Than seide he thus  as ȝe shuln after here
  Nat may the wooful spirit  in myn hert
Declare a poynt  of alle my sorwes smert
To ȝow my lady  that I loue most
But I quethe  the  seruyse of my gost
To ȝow  abouen euery creature
Sen that my lif  may no lengere dure
Allas the woo  allas the peynes stronge
That I for ȝow haue  suffred  and so longe
Allas the deth  allas myn Emelye
Allas departyng  of oure companye
Allas myn hertes Quene  allas my wyf
Myn hertes lady  endere of my lif
What is this world  what asken men to haue
Now with his loue  now in his cold graue

Farewele my swete farewele myn Emely
And soft take me in your armes twey
For the loue of god and herkeneth what I sey  
  I haue here with my Cosyn  Palamon
had strif and rancour  many a day agon
ffor loue of ȝow  and for my Ielousie
And Iubiter  so wysly  my soule gye


To speken of a seruaunt  proprely
with circumstaunceȝ  all trewely
That is to seyn  trewþe  honour  knyȝthede
Wysdom humblesse  estate  and heigh kynrede
ffreedom  and al that longeth  to that art  
So Iubiter haue  of my soule part
As in this world right now  ne knowe I non
So worthy to ben loued  as Palamon
That serueth ȝow  and wel don al his lyf
And if þat euere  ȝe schuln ben a wyf
fforȝete nat Palamon  the gentil man
  And with that word  his speche faile began
ffor fro his fete  vp to his brest was come
The colde of deth  that had him ouercome
And ȝet moreouer  for in his armes two
The vitayll strengthe  is lost and al ago
Oonly the intellect  withouten more
That dwelleth  in his hert  seke and sore
Gan faylen  whan the hert feleth deth
Dusked ys hise eyen two  and faileth breth
But on his lady  ȝet cast he his eye
His last word  was mercy Emelye
his spirit chaunged hens  and went there
As I cam neuere  I kan nat tellen where
Therfore I stynt  I am no diuinistre
Of soules fynde I nouȝt  in this registre
Ne me ne list  thilke opinions to telle
Of hem  though þat þei wryten  where they dwelle
Arcite is cold  there Mars his soule gye
Now wol I speken forth  of Emelye
  Shryghte  Emelye  and howleth Palamon
And Theseus his Suster  tok anon
Swoughnyng  and bar hire  fro the corps away
What helpeth it  to tarien forth the day
To tellen how she wepte  both eue and morwe
ffor in swich cas  wommen han swich sorwe


Whan þat here husbondes  ben fro hem ago
That for the more part  they sorwen so
Or ellis fallen  in swich a maladie
That at the last  certeynly they deye
  Infinite ben the sorwes  and the teeres
Of olde folk  and folk of tendre ȝeres
In al the Toun  for the deth  of this Theban
ffor him þere wepeth  bothe child and man
So gret a wepyng  was þere non certeyn
Whan Ector was brought  al fressh Islayn
To Troye  allas the pyte that was there
Cracchyng of chekes  rendyng eke of here
Why woldest þou be ded  theise wommen crye
And haddest gold Inow  and Emelye  
  No man myght gladen  Theseus
Sauyng his old fader  Egeus
That knew this worldlis  transmutacion
As he had seyn it chaunge  boþe vp and doun
Ioye after woo  and woo after gladnes
And shewed him ensample  and lyknes
Right as there deyed neuere man  quod he
That he ne loued in erthe  in som degre
Right so þere lyued neuere man  he seide
In al this world  þat somtyme he ne deyede
This world nys but a thurghfeire  ful of woo
And we ben pilgrimes  passyng to and froo
Deth is an ende  of euery worldly sore
And ouer al this  ȝet seide he meche more
To this effect  ful wysly to enhorte
The peeple  þat they shuld him  recomforte
  Duke Theseus  with al his bysy cure
Oast now where  that the sepulture
Of goode Arcite  may best Imaked be
And eke most honourable  in his degre
And at the last  he tok conclusion
That there as first  Arcite and Palamon


hadden for loue  the bataylle hem bytwene
That in the selue Groue  swete and grene
There as he had  his amorous desires
Hys compleynt  and for loue his hote fires
he wold make a fir  in which the office
ffunerall  he myght al accomplice
And lete anon comaunde  to hakke and hewe
The Okes olde  and leyn hem on a rewe
In culpons  wel arayed for to brenne
  His officers  with swift fet they renne
And ride anon  at his comaundement
And after this  Theseus hath Isent
After a Bere  and it al ouerspredde
with clothes of gold  the richest þat he hadde
And of þe same seute  he clad Arcite
vpon his handes  his glowys whyte
Eke on his hede  a corone of laurere grene
And in his hand  a swerd ful bright and kene
He leid him bare  the visage  on the bere
Therwith he wepte  that pite was to here
And for the peeple  shuld sen him alle
Whan it was day  he brouȝt him to þe halle
That roreth of the criyng and the soun
Tho cam this wooful Theaban  Palamon  
With flotry berd  and ruggy asshy heres
In clothes blake  Idropped al with teres
And passyng othere  of wepyng  Emelye
The reufullest  of al the cumpanye
And in as meche  as the seruyse shuld be
The more noble  and riche in his degree
Duke Theseus  let forth the steedes bryng
That trapped weren  in stele al gleteryng
And couered with the Armes  of daun Arcite
vpon the steedes  grete and whyte
There seten folk  of which on bar his shelde
Another his spere  vpon his hondes helde


They bar with him  his bowe Turkeys
Of brend gold was the caas  and eke the harneys
And riden forth a paas  with sorweful chere
Toward the Groue  as ȝe schuln after here
The noblest of the Grekys  that there were
Vpon here shuldres  carieden the bere
with slakke paas  and eyen rede and wete
Thorughouȝt the Citee  by the maister strete
That spred was al with blak  and wonder hye
Ryght of the same  is the strete Iwrye
  Vpon the right hand  went old Egeus
And on that other side  Duke Theseus
With vesseles in here handes  of gold ful fyne
Al ful of hony  melk  Blod  and wyne
Eke Palamon  with ful gret companye
And after þat cam  wooful Emelye
With fir in hand  as was þat tyme the gyse
To do the offise  of ffunerall seruyce
  Heigh labour  and gret apparaillyng
Was at the seruice  and the fir makyng
That with his grene top  the heuene laught
And xxti  fadome of brede  the armes straught
This is to seyn  the bowes were so brode
Of stree first  there was leid mony a lode
  But how the fire  was maked vp on height
Ne eke the names  how the trees hight
As Oke fir  Birche  Aspe  Alder  holm  Popler Arbores
Wylew  Elm  Plane  Assh  Box  Chesteyn  lynde  laurer
Mapul  Thorn  Beche  Hasel  Ew  Whippeltre
How they were feld  shal nat be told for me
  Ne how the goddes  ronnen vp and doun
Disherited  of here habitacion
In which they woneden in rest and pees
nymphes fawnes and madrides
Ne how the bestes and the briddes all
ffledden for ferde whan whan the wode was fall


Ne how the grounde agast was of the light
That was nat wonte to seen the sonne bright
Ne how the fire was chaunged first with stre
And then dry stykkes cloven in iij·
And than with grene wode and spicery
And than with cloth of golde and with perry
And garlandes hangyng full of many a flour
The mirre Theceus with all the grete sauour
Ne how Arcite lay amonge all this
Ne what ricches aboute his body ys
Ne how that Emelye as was the gyse
put in the fire of funerall seruice
Ne how the swowned whan men made the fire
ne what she spake ne what was hir desire
ne what Iewels men in the fire cast
Whan that the fire was grete and brent faste
Ne how som her sheldes and som her spere
And of her vestimentes which that they were
And cuppes full of mylke and wyne and blode
Into the fire than brent as yt were wode
And how the grekes with an houge route
Thries ryden the fire aboute
Vpon the left hande with a loude showtyng
And thries with her speres clateryng
And thries how the ladies gonnen crye
And how that lad was homward Emelye
Ne how Arcite ys brent to asshen colde
Ne how þat light wake was yholde
All that night ne how the grekes pleye
The wake pleys ne kepe I nat to seye
Who wrastelleth best naked with oyle enoynt
Ne who that bare hym best in no disioynt  
I woll nat tellen all how they gon
Hom to Athenes whan the pleye ys don
But shortly to the poynte than woll I wende
And maken of my longe tale an ende


By processe and by length of certein yeres
All stynt is the mournyng and the teres
Of grekes by one generall assent
Than semed me there was a parlement
Among the which pointes spoken was
At Athenes vpon certein poyntes and caas
To haue with certein encres aliaunce
And haue fully of Thebans obeisaunce
ffor which this noble Theseus anon
leten sende after gentell Palamon
Vnwyst of hym what was the cause and why
But in his blake clothes sorowfully
he cam at his comaundement in hie
Tho sent Theseus for Emelye
Whan they were set and hussh was all the place
And Theseus abyden hath a space
Er ony worde cam from his wyse brest
His yeen set he there as was his list
And with a sad visage he sighed styll
And after þat right thus he seide his will
The first mouer of the cause aboue
whan he first made þe feir cheine of loue
Grete was theffect and hie was his entent
Wele wist he why and what thereof he ment
ffor with þat feir chein of loue he bonde
The fire the eyer the water and the londe
In certein bondes that they may nat fle
That same prince and þat mover quod he
hath stabliced in this wrecched world adoun
Certein dayes and duracioun
To all that gendred is in this place
Ouer the which day they may nat pace
All mow they yit tho dayes abrigge
There nedeth none auctorite to alegge
ffor yt ys preued by experience 
But þat me list declaren my sentence  

Then men may wele by this ordre discerne
That thilke mover stable ys and eterne
Wele may men knowe but it be a fole
That euery part is dareined from his hole
ffor nature hath nat taken his begynnyng
Of no party or of cantell or of a thing
But of a thing that parfite is and stable
Descendyng so tyll it be corumpable
And therfore for his wyse purveyaunce
He hath so wele byset his ordinaunce
That spices of thinges and progressions
Sholden enduren by successions
And noght eterne withouten ony lye
This maist þou vndrestonde and seyn at eye
Lo the Oke  that hath  so longe a norisshyng
ffro the tyme  þat it first  bygynneth to spryng
And hath so longe a lyf  as ȝe may se
Ȝet at the last  wasted is the tree
Considereth eke  how that the harde ston
Vnder oure fote  on which we ride and gon
It wasteth  as it lith  by the weye
The brode ryuer  somtyme waxeth drye
The grete townes  se we wane and wend
Than se ȝe  þat al this thyng  hath an end
Of man and womman  se we wel also
That nedes in on  of þeise termes two
This is to seyn  in ȝouthe or ellis in age
he mot be ded  the kyng  as shal a page
Som in his bed  som in the depe see
Som in the large feld  as ȝe moun se
There helpeth nouȝt  alle gon þat ilke wey
Than may I seyn  that al this thyng mot dey
  What makith this  but Iubiter the kyng
That is prince and cause  of alle thyng
Conuertyng alle  vnto his propre wylle
ffrom which it is derreyned  soth to telle


And here ageyns  no creature on lyue
Of no degree  auayleth nat for to stryue
  Than is it wysdom  as it thynketh me
To maken vertue  of necessite
And take it wele  þat we may nat escheue
And namelich  þat to vs alle  is due
And whoso gruccheth ouȝt  he doth folie
That rebel is to hym  þat al may gye
And certeynly  a man hath most honour
To dyen  in his excellence and flour
Whan he is syker  of his good name
Than hath he don  his frend ne him no shame
And gladdere ought his frend  ben of his deth
Whan þat with honour  ȝolden is his breth
Than whan his name  appalled is for age
ffor al forgetyn  is his vassillage
Than is it best  as for a worthy fame
To dyen  whan he is best of name
The contrary of al this  is wylfulnesse
Why grucchen we  why haue we heuynesse
That good Arcite  of Chyualrie the flour
Departed ys  with duete and honour
Ouȝt of this foul prison  of this lyf
Why grucchen heere  his Cosyn and his wyff  
Of his welfare  that louen him so wele
Can he hem thank  nay god wot  neuere a dele
That bothe his soule  and eke hem self offend
And ȝet they moun  here lustes nat amend
  What may I concluden  of this long serie
But after woo  I rede vs alle be merye
And thanken Iubiter  of al his grace
And er we departen  from this place
I rede we make  of sorwes two
O parfyt Ioye  lastyng euere moo
And loketh now  where most sorwe is hereInne
There wyl I first amenden  and bygynne


  Suster quod he  this is my ful assent
with alle the lordes here  of my parlement
Tat Ientil Palamon  ȝoure owen knyght
That serueth ȝow  with wyl hert and myght
And euere hath don  syn first ȝe him knewe
That ȝe schuln of ȝour grace  vpon him rewe
And taken him for husbonde  and for lord
lene me ȝoure hand  for þis is oure acord
lat se now  of ȝoure wommanly pitee
he is a kyngis brotheres sone  parde
And though he were  a pore bachelere
Syn he hath serued ȝow  so many a ȝere
And had for ȝow  so gret aduersitee
It must ben considered  leueth me
ffor gentil mercy  ouȝt to passen right
  Than seide he thus  to Palamon the knyght
I trowe there nedeth  litel sermonyng
To maken ȝow assenten  to this thyng
Come nere  and taketh ȝoure lady  by the hond
Bytwixen hem  was mad anon the bond
That hight matrimon  or mariage
By al the counseil  and the baronage
  And thus with al blisse  and melodye
hath Palamon Iwedded  Emelye
And god þat al this world  hath wrought
Sende him his loue  þat hath it dere abought
ffor now is Palamon  in all wele
leuyng in blisse  in richesse and in hele
And Emelye  him loueth so tenderly
And he hire serueth  so gentilly
That þere was  no word  hem bytwene
Of ielousie  or ony other tene  
Thus endeth Palamon  and Emelye
And god saue al  this fair companye
WHan that the knyght  had thus his tale Itold
In al the companye  ne was þere ȝong ne old
That he ne seide  it was a noble storie
And worthy for to drawen  to memorie
And namely the gentiles  euerychon
  Oure Host lough  and swor as mot I gon
This goth aright  vnbocled is the male
Lat se now  who shal telle  another tale
ffor trewely  þis game is wel bygonne
Now telleth ȝe sire Monke  if þat ȝe cone
Som what  to quyte with  þe knyghtes tale
  The Millere  þat fordronken was  of Ale
So þat vnethe vpon his hors he sat
he nolde avalen  neither hod ne hat
Ne abyden no man  for his curteysie
But in pilates vois  he gan to crye
And swor by armes  and by blod and bones
I can a noble tale  for the nones
With which I wol now  quyte þe knyghtes tale
Oure host saw  that he was dronke of ale
And seide abyde  Robyn leue brother
Som betir man  shal telle vs first another
Abyde  and late vs werkyn  thriftily
By goddes soule quod he  that wol nat I
ffor I wol speke  or elles go my wey
Oure host answered  telle on a dewel wey
Thow art a fool  thy wyt is ouercome
  Now herkeneth quod the Millere  alle and some
But first I make  a protestacion
That I am dronke  I knowe it be my soun
And þerfore  if that I  mysspeke or sey
Wyteth it the Ale  of Southwerk  I prey


ffor I wol telle  a legend  or a lyf
Bothe of a Carpenter  and of his wyf
How þat a Clerk  hath set the wryghtes cap
  The Reve answered  and seide stynt thy clap  
late be thyn lewed  dronken Harlotrie
It is a synne  and eke a gret folie
To apeyren any man  of his defame
And eke to brynge wyues  in swich name
Thow maist Inow  of othere thynges seyn
  This dronken Millere  spak ful sone ageyn
And seide  leue brother Oswold
Who hath no wyf  he is no Cokewold
But I seye nat þerfore  that þou art on
There ben ful goode wyues  many on
     
    
Why art þou angry  with my tale now
I haue a wyf parde  as wel as thow
Ȝet nolde I  for the Oxen in my plough
Taken vpon me  more than Inough
As demen on my self  þat I were one
I wol byleue wel  þat I am none
An husbonde  shal nat ben inquesitif
Of goddes preuyte  ne of his wyf
So he may fynden  goddes foyson there
Of the remenaunt  nedeth nat enquere
  What shulde I more seyn  but þis Millere
he nolde hise wordes  for no man forbere
But told his Cherles tale  in his manere
Me athynketh  þat I shal  reherce it here
And therfore  euery gentil wyght I pray
Demeth nat  for goddes loue  that I say
Of euele entent  but for I mot reherce
here tales alle  al be they bet  or werce
Or elles falsen  som of my matere
And þerfore  woso list it nat  to here


Turne ouer the lef  and chese anoþer tale
ffor he shal fynde Inowe  grete and smale
Of storial thyng  that toucheth gentilnesse
And eke moralite  and holynesse
Blameth nat me  if þat ȝe chese amys
The Millere is a charl  ȝe knowe wel this
So was the Reve eke  and othere moo
And Harlotrie they tolden  bothe two
Avyseth ȝow  and put me ouȝt of blame
And eke  men shuln nat make  ernest of game

WHilom there was dwellyng  in Oxenford
A riche gnof  that gestes held to bord
And of his craft  he was a Carpentere
with him þere was dwellyng  a poore scolere
Had lerned art  but al his fantasye
was turned  for to lerne  Astrologye
And koude a serteyn  of conclusions
To demen  by interrogacions
If þat men asked him  in certeyn houres
What þat men shuld haue  drought or elles shoures
Or if men asked him  what shulde byfalle
Of euery thyng  I may nat rekken hem alle
  This Clerk was cleped  hende Nicholas
Of derne loue he coude  and of solas
And therto he was sly  and ful preue
And like a Maide  meke for to se
A Chaumbre had he  in that hostelrye
Alone  withouten ony companye
fful fetisly dight  with herbes swote
And he him self  as swete as is the rote
Of licoris  or ony Setuale
his Almageste  and bokes grete and smale
his Astralabie  longyng for his art
His Augryme stones  loyn faire apert
On shelues  kouched  at his beddis hede
His presse couered  with a faldyng rede
And al aboue  there lay a gay Sautrye
On whiche he mad  on nyghtis melodye
So swetely  þat al the chaumber rong
And Angelus ad virginem  he song
And after that  he song the kynges note
fful often blissed  was his mery throte


And thus this swete Clerk  his tyme spent
After his frendis fyndyng  and his rent
  This Carpenter had wedded  newe a wyf
which þat he loued  more than his lyf
Of xviij ȝere  she was of age
Ielous he was  and held hire narwe in kage
ffor she was wylde  and ȝong  and he was old
And demed him self  to ben like a Cokewold
he knew nat Caton  for his wyt was rude
That bad men shulde wedde  here similitude
Men shulde wedden  after here astate
ffor ȝouthe and age  is often at debate
But sithe þat he  was fallen in the snare  
he must enduren  as other folk  his care
  ffair was this ȝong wyf  and therewithalle
As ony wesyl  hir body gent and smalle
A Seynt she wered barred  al of sylke
A barmclothe as whyte  as morwe mylke
vpon hire lendes  ful of many a goore
white was hire smokke  and browded al byfore
And eke behynd  on hire coler aboute
Of cole blak sylk  withInne and eke withoute
The tapes  of hire white volupere
Were of þe same seute  of hire colere
hire filet brod of sylk  and set ful hye
And sekirly she hadde  a lykerous eye
fful smale Ipulled  were hire browes two
And tho were bent  and blake as is a slo
She was ful more blisful  on to se
Than is the newe  PereIonet tre
And softer þanne the wolle is  of a weder
And by hire girdel heng  a purs of lether
Tasseled with silk  and perled with latoun
In al this world  to seken vp and doun
There nys no man  so wys  þat coude thenche
So gay a popelot  or swiche a wenche


fful brightere was the shynyng  of hire hewe
Than in the Tour  the noble Iforged newe
But of hire song  it was as loude  and ȝerne
As ony swalwe  sittyng on a berne
Therto she coude skyp  and make game
As ony kydde or calf  folwyng his dame
Hire mouth was swete  as braket or the meth
Or hoord of apples  leyd in hey or heth
Wynsyng she was  as is a ioly colt
long as a mast  and vpright as a bolt
A broche she bar  vpon hire lowe coler
As brod  as is the boos  of a bokeler
hire shoes were laced  on hire legges heye
She was a prymerole  a Pyggesnye
ffor any lord  to leggen in his bedde
Or ȝet  for ony good ȝemman  to wedde
  Now sire and eft sire  so byfel the cas
That on a day  þis hende Nicholas
ffel with þis ȝong wyf  to rage and pleye
While that hire husbond  was at Osneye
As clerkis ben ful sotil  and ful queynt
And preuyly  he caught hire  by the queynt  
And seide Iwysse  but ich haue my wylle
ffor derne loue  of the lemman  I spille
And held hire harde  by the haunche bones
And seide lemman  loue me al at ones
Or I wol deyen  also god me saue
And she sprong  as a colt doth in a traue
And with hire hed  she wryed fast awey
She seyde  I wol nat kysse the  be my fey
We lat be quod ich  lat be Nicholas
Or I wol crie  ouȝt herrowe  and allas
Do wey ȝoure handes  for ȝoure curteisie
  This Nicholas  gan mercy for to crye
And spak so faire  and profred him so faste
That she hire loue  hym graunted at the laste


And swor hire oth  by seynt Thomas of Kent
That she wolde ben  at his comaundement
whan þat she may  hire leiser wel aspie
Myn husbond is  so ful of Ielusye
That but ȝe wayte wel  and be preue
I wot right wel  I nam but ded quod she
Ȝe must be ful derne  as in this cas
  Nay therof care the nought  quod Nicholas
A Clerk had litherly  byset his whyle
But if he coude  a Carpenter begyle
And thus they ben  acorded  and Isworn
To wayte a tyme  as I haue told byforn
 whan Nicholas had don this  euery dele
And thakkede hire  aboute the lendes wele
he kisseth hire swete  and taketh his sautrie
And pleyeth faste  and maketh melodye
  Thanne fel it thus  þat to the Parissh Chirche
Cristes owen werk  for to werche
This good wyf went  on an haliday
hire forhede shon  as bright as ony day
So was it wasshen  whan she lete hir werk
  Now was there of þat chirche  a parissh clerk
The which  þat was Icleped  Absolon
Crool was his heer  and as the gold it shon
And strotted as a fanne  large and brode
fful streyt and euene  lay his ioly shode
his rode was rede  his eyen grey as goos
with Poules wyndowes  coruen on hise shoos
In Hosen rede  he went ful fetislye  
Iclad he was  ful smal and proprelye
Al in a kirtil  of a light vaget
fful fair and thikke  ben the poyntis set
And thervpon  he had a gay surplice
As white as is  the blosme on the rice
A mery child he was  so god me saue
wel coude he laten blod  and clippe and shaue


And make a charter of lond  or acquietance
In xxti maners  coude he tryppe and daunce
After the scole  of Oxenford tho
And with hise leggis  casten to and fro
And pleyen song  on a smal ribible
Therto he song som tyme  a loude quynyble
And as wel coude he pley  on a geterne
In al the Toun nas there  brewhous ne Tauerne
That he ne vesited  with his solace
There ony gaylard  tapstere was
But sothe to seyn  he was somdele squeymous
Of fartyng  and of speche daungerous
This Absolon  that ioly was and gay
Goth with a Censer  on the haliday
Sensyng the wyues  of the Parissh fast
And many a louely loke  on hem he cast
And namely  on this Carpenteres wyf
To loke on hire  him þought a mery lif
She was so propre  and swete  and likerous
I dar wel seyn  if she had ben a Mous
And he a kat  he wold hire hent anon
This parissh Clerk  this ioly Absolon
hath in his hert  swich a loue longyng
That of no wyf  toke he non offryng
ffor curteisie he seide  he wold non
The Mone  whan it was nyght  ful bright shon
And Absolon  his gytterne  hath Itake
ffor paramours he þought  for to wake
And forth he goth  Iolyf and amerous
Til he cam  to the Carpenters hous
A litel after Cokkes  had Icrowe
And dressed him vp  by a shot wyndowe
That was vpon  the Carpenteres wal
he syngeth in his voys  gentil and smal
Now dere lady  if thy wyl be
I pray ȝow  þat ȝe wol  rewe on me


fful wel accordyng  to his gitternyng
  This Carpenter awoke  and herd him syng  
And spak vnto his wyf  and seide anon
What Alison  herest þou nat Absolon
That chaunteth thus  vnder oure boures walle
And she answered hire husbond  therewithalle
Ȝis god wot Iohn  I here it euery dele
This passeth forth  what wyl ȝe bet than wele
ffro day to day  this Ioly Absolon
So wougheth hire  that him is woobygon
he waketh al the nyght  and al the day
he kembeth hise lokkes brode  and mad him gay
he wougheth hire by menes  and brocage
And swor he wolde ben  hire owen page
he syngeth brokkyng  as a Nyghtyngale
And sent hire pyment  Meth and spiced ale
And waferes pypyng hote  ouȝt of the glede
And for she was of Toune  he profred mede
ffor somme folk  wol be wonnen for richesse
And somme for strokes  and somme for gentilnesse
Somtyme to shewen  his lightnesse and maistrye
he pleyeth heraudes  vpon a skaffold heye
  But whatavailleth him  as in this cas
She loueth so  this hende Nicholas
That Absolon may blowe  the bukkes horn
he ne had for his labour  but a skorn
And thus she maketh  Absolon hire Ape
And al his ernest  turneth to a Iape
fful soth is this prouerbe  it is no lye
Men sayn right thus  alwey the nye slye
Maketh the fer leef  to be loth
ffor though þat Absolon  be wood or wroth
Bycause þat he fer wes  from hire sight
This nye Nicholas  stod in his light
  Now bere the wel  thow hende Nicholas
ffor Absolon may waylle  and synge allas


And so byfel it  that on a Saterday
This Carpenter  was gone to Osney
And hende Nicholas  and Alison
Accorded ben  to this conclusion
That Nicholas  shal shapen hem a wyle
The sely Ielous husbonde  to begyle
And if so be  the game went aright
She shulde slepe  in his arme al nyght  
ffor this was hire desir  and his also
And right anon  withoute wordes moo
This Nicholas  no lengere wold tarie
But doth ful softe  vnto his chaumbre carie
Bothe mete and drynk  for a day or twey
And to hire husbonde  bad hire for to sey
If that he axed  after Nicholas
She shulde seye  she nyst where he was
Of al that day  she sey him nat with eye
She trowed þat he was  in sum maladye
ffor · for no cry  hire mayde koude him calle
he nolde answere  for thyng þat myght falle
This passeth forth  al thilk Satirday
That Nicholas stille  in his chaumbre lay
And ete and slepe  or dede what him list
Til Sonday  that þe sonne goth to rest
  This sely Carpenter  hath gret merueylle
Of Nicholas  or what thyng myght him eylle
And seide  I am adrad  by seynt Thomas
It stondeth nat a right  with Nicholas
God shilde  þat he deyed sodeynly
This world is now  ful tekil sekerly
I saw today  a cors Iborn to chirche
That now on monday last  I saw him werche
Go vp quod he  vnto his knaue anon
Clepe at the dore  and knokke with a ston
loke how it is  and telle me boldely
  This knaue goth him vp  ful sturdily


And at the chaumbre dore  while þat he stode
he cryed and knokked  as he were wode
what how  what do ȝe  Maister Nicholay
how may ȝe slepen  al the long day
But al for nouȝt  he seide nat a worde
An hole he fond  ful lowe vpon the borde
There as the Cat  was wont  In  for to crepe
And at that hole  he loked In  ful depe
And at the last  he had of him a sight
This Nicholas sat euere  gapyng vpright
As he had loked  on the newe Mone
Adoun he goth  and telleth his maister sone
In what array  he saugh this ilke man
  This Carpenter  to blissen him  bygan
And seide  helpe vs  seynt ffredeswyde
A man wot litel  what hym shal betyde  
This man is fallen  with his Astronomye
In som woodnesse  or in som Agonye
I thought ay wele  how that it shulde be
Men shuld nat knowe  of goddis preuyte
Ȝa blissed be alwey  a lewed man
That nought but only  his byleue can
So ferde another clerk  with his Astronomye
he walked in the feldes  for to prye
Vpon the sterres  what there shuld byfalle
Til þat he  in a marle pyt  was falle
he saw nat that  but ȝet be Seynt Thomas
Me reweth sore  of hende Nicholas
he shal be ratid  of his studiyng
If þat I may  be Ihesus heuene kyng
Get me a staf  that I may vnder pore
while þat þow Robyn  heuest of the dore
he shal ouȝt of his studiyng  as I gesse
And to the chaumbre dore  he gan him dresse
his knaue was a strong Carl  for the nones
And by the haspe  he haf it of at ones


In to the flore  the dore fel anon
This Nicholas sat ay as stille  as ony ston
And euere he gaped vpward  into the Eyre
This Carpentere wende  he were in dispeyre
And hent him  by the shuldres  myghtyly
And shoke him harde  and cried spetously
what Nicholay  what how  loke adoun
Awake  and thynk on cristes passion
I crouche the from Elues  and fro wyghtes
Therewith the nyght spel  seide he anon rightes
On foure halues  of the hous aboute
And on the thressewold  at the dore withoute
Ihesu crist  and seynt Benedyght
Blisse this hous  fro euery euyl wyght
ffor the nyghtesmare  the whyȝt Pater noster
Where wonest thow  seynt Petres suster
  And at the last  this hende Nicholas
Gan for to sighe sore  and seide allas
Shal al the world  be lost eftsones now
This Carpenter answered  what seist þou
what thynk on god  as we don men þat swynke
  This Nicholas answered  fecche me a drynke
And after wol I speke  in preuyte
Of thyng þat toucheth  the and me
I wyl telle it non other man  certeyn  
This Carpenter goth doun  and cometh ageyn
And brought of myghty ale  a large quart
And whanne þat ech of hem  had dronken his part
This Nicholas  his dore faste shette
And doun the Carpenter  by him he sette
And seide Iohn myn host  lef and dere
Thow shalt vpon thy treuthe  swere me heere
That to no wyght  þou shalt my counseil wreye
ffor it is cristes counseil  þat I seye
And if þou telle ony man  þou art forlore
ffor this vengeaunce  thow shalt haue þerfore


That if þou wreye me  thow shalt be wode
Nay  criste forbede it  for his holy blode
Quod tho this sely man  I am non labbe
Ne though I sey it  I nam nat lief to gabbe
Sey what þou wyle  I shal it neuere telle
To child ne wyf  by him þat harwed helle
  Now Iohn quod this Nicholas  I wol nat lye
I haue founden  in myn Astrologye
As I haue loked  in the Mone bright
That now on monday next  at quarter nyght
Shall fallen a reyn  and that so wylde and wood
That half so gret  was neuere Noes flod
This world he seide  in lesse than an houre
Shal be dreynt  so hydous is the shoure
Thus shal mankynde  drenche  and lese here lif
This Carpenter answered  allas my wyf
And shal she drenche  allas myn Alisoun
ffor sorwe of this  he fel almost adoun
And seide  is there no remedye in this cas
We ȝis for gode  quod hende Nicholas
If þou wilt werken  after lore and rede
Thow maist nat werken  after þin owen hede
ffor thus seith Salamon  þat was ful trewe
werk al by counseyl  and þow shalt nat rewe
And if thow werken wolt  by good counsaylle
I vndertake  withouten mast or saylle
Ȝet shal I saue hire  and the and me
hast þou nat herd  how saued was Noe
whanne þat oure lord  had warned him biforn
That al the world  with water shuld be lorn
  Ȝis quod this Carpentere  ful ȝore ago
hast þou nat herd  quod Nicholas also
The sorwe of Noe  with his felaweshipe
Er that he myght gete  his wyf to shipe  
hym had be leuere  I dar wel vndertake
At thilk tyme  than alle hise wetheres blake


That she had had  a ship hireself alone
And þerfore wost þou what  is best to done
This asketh hast  and of an hasty thyng
Men moun nat preche  and maken tariyng
Anon go gete vs fattes  into this Inne
A knedyng trow  or ellis a kamelyne
ffor ech of vs  but loke þat they be large
In whiche we moun swymme  as in a barge
And haue þereInne  vetaille sufficient
But for o day  fy on the remenaunt
The water shal aslake  and gon awey
Aboute pryme  vpon the next day
But Robyn may nat wyte of this  thy knaue
Ne eke thy mayde Gille  I may nat saue
Aske nat why  for though þou axe me
I wol nat telle  goddis preuyte
Suffiseth the  but if thyne wyttes madde
To han as gret a grace  as Noe hadde
Thy wyf shal I wel sauen  ouȝt of doute
Go now thy wey  and spede the here aboute
But when þou hast  for hire and the and me
Igeten vs  theise knedyng tubbes thre
Thanne shalt þou hangen hem  in the roof ful heye
That noman  of oure purueance  espie
And whan þow hast don  as I haue seid
And hast oure vetaille  faire in hem leyd
And eke an ax  to smyte the cord atwo
Whan þat the water cometh  þat we may go
And breke an hole an hey  vpon the gable
Vnto the gardeyn ward  ouer the stable
That we moun freely passen  forth oure wey
whanne þat the grete shour  is gon awey
Thanne shalt þou swymme  as mery I vndertake
As doth the white doke  after hire drake
Than wyl I clepe  how Alison  how Iohn
Be mery  for the flode  shal passe anon


And þou wolt seyn  heyl Maister Nicholay
Good morwe  I se the wele  for it is day
And þanne shuln we  be lordes all oure lyf
Of al the world  as Noe and his wyf
But of o thyng  I warne the ful right  
Be we avysed  on that ilke nyght
That we ben entred  into shippes bord
That non of vs  speke nat a word
Ne clepe ne crie  but ben in his prayere
ffor it is  goddis  owen heste dere
Thy wyf and thow  mot hange fer atwynne
ffor that betwixe ȝow  shal be no synne
No more in lokyng  than there shal in dede
This ordynance is seid  so god the spede
Tomorwe at nyght  when men ben alle aslepe
Into our kneding tubbes  wol we crepe
And sitten there  abidyng goddis grace
Go now thy wey  I haue no lengere space
To maken of this  no lengere sermonynge
Men seyn thus  sende the wyse  and sey no thynge
Thou art so wys  it nedeth the nought to teche
Go saue oure lyf  and that I the byseche
  This sely Carpenter  goth forth his wey
fful ofte he seide  allas and wellawey
And to his wyf  he told his preuyte
And she was war  and knewe it bet than he
what al þis queynt cas  was for to sey
But natheles  she ferd as she wold dey
And seide allas  go forth thy weye anon
help vs to skape  or we ben ded ichon
I am thy trewe  verray wedded wyf
Go dere spouse  and help to saue oure lyf
lo whiche a gret thyng  is affeccion
Men moun deyen  of ymaginacion
So depe  may impression be take
This sely Carpenter  begynneth quake


hym thynketh verraylich  that he may se
Noes flode  come walwyng as the see
To drenchen Alison  his hony dere
he wepeth wailleth  and maketh sory chere
he sigheth  with ful many a sory swough
And goth and getith him  a knedyng trow
And after a tubbe  and a kemelyn
And preuyly he sent hem  to his In
And heng hem in the roof  in preuytee
his owen hand  he made laddres thre
To clymben by the roumes  and the stalkes
Vnto the Tubbes  hanggyng in the balkes
And hem vetailled  bothe kemelyn trow and Tubbe
With bred and chese  and good ale in a Iubbe  
Suffisyng right Inow  as for a day
But er that he  had mad al this array
he sent his knaue  and eke his wenche also
vpon his nede  to london for to go
And on the monday  whan it drow to nyght
he shette his dore  withouten candel light
And dressyd al thyng  as it shulde be
And shortly vp they clymben alle thre
They setyn stille  wel a forlong wey
Now pater noster  clum seide Nicholay
And clum quod Iohn  and clum seide Alison
This Carpenter  seide his deuocion
And stille he syt  and biddeth his prayere
Awaytyng on the reyn  if he it here
The dede slepe  for verrey besynesse
ffel on this Carpenter  right as I gesse
Aboute curfewe tyme  or litel more
ffor trauaille of his gest  he groneth sore
And eft he routeth  for his hede myslay
Down on the laddre  stalketh Nicholay
And Alison ful soft  adoun she spedde
Withoute wordes mo  they gon to bedde


There as this Carpenter  is wont to lye
There was the reuel  and the melodye
And thus lyn Alison  and Nicholas
In besynesse of myrthe  and in solas
Til that the belle  of laudes gan to rynge
And freres in the chaunsel  gon synge
  This parissh Clerk  this amerous Absolon
That is for loue  alwey so woobygon
vpon the monday  was at Osneye
with companye  him to disporte and pleye
And axed vpon cas  a cloisterere
fful preuyly  after Iohn the Carpentere
And he drough him apert  ouȝt of the chirche
And seide I not  I saugh him here nat werche
Sithe Satirday  I trow þat he be went
ffor tymber  there oure Abbot hath him sent
ffor he is wont  for tymber for to go
And dwellyn at the Graunge  a day or two
Or ellis he is  at his hous certeyn
where that he be  I kan nat sothely seyn
  This Absolon  ful Ioly was and light
And thouȝt now is tyme  to wake al nyght
And sekirly  I saugh him nat steryng  
Aboute his dore  sen day began to spring
So mot I thryue  I shal at Cokkes crowe
fful preuly knokken  at his wyndowe
That stant ful lowe  vpon his boures walle
To Alison now  wol I tellen alle
My loue longyng for ȝet  I shal nat mysse
That at the leste weye  I shal hire kysse
Som maner comfort  shal I haue parfay
My mouth hath yched  al this long day
This is a signe  of kyssyng at the lest
Al nyght me mette eke  þat I was at a fest
Therfore I wyl go slepe  an houre or twey
And al the nyght þanne  wol I wake and pley


  Whan that the first kok  hath crow anon
Vp risith this Ioly louyere  Absolon
And him arrayeth gay  at poynt deuys
But first he cheweth  Greynes and lycoris
To smellen swete  er he had kembed his heer
Vnder his tonge  a treweloue he ber
ffor therby wend he  to be gracious
he rometh  to the Carpenteres hous
And stille he stant  vnder the shot wyndowe
Vnto his brest it raught  it was so lowe
And softe he koughed  with a semy soun
What do ȝe honycombe  swete Alison
My fair brede  my swete Cinamome
Awaketh lemman myn  and speketh to me
Wol litel thenke ȝe  vpon my woo
That for ȝoure loue  I swete there I go
No wonder is  though þat I swelt and swete
I morne as doth a lambe  after the tete
Iwysse lemman  I haue swich loue longyng
That like a Turtill trewe  is my murnyng
I may nat ete  no more than a mayde
  Go fro the wyndowe  Iakke fool she seyde
As help me god  it wol nat be compame
I loue another  and ellis I were to blame
wel bet than the  by Ihesu Absolon
Go forth thy wey  or I wol cast a ston
And lete me slepe  a twenty deuel wey
Allas quod Absolon  and weyllawey
That trewloue was  euere  so yuel bysette
Than kisse me  sithe it may be no bette
ffor Ihesus loue  and for the loue of me
Wylt thow thanne go thy wey  therwith quod she  
Ȝa certis lemman  quod this Absolon
Than make the redy quod she  I come anon
     
    
This Absolon doun sette him  on his knees


And seyde  I am a lord  at alle degrees
ffor after this  I hope there cometh more
Lemman thy grace  and swete brede thyn ore
The wyndowe she vndoth  and that in hast
Haue Idon quod she  come of and spede the fast
leste that oure neyghebores  the espie
This Alison gan wype  his mouth ful drye
Derke was the nyght  as pych or as the cole
And at the wyndowe  ouȝt she put hire hole
And Absolon him fel  neither bet ne wers
But with his mouth  he kiste hire naked ers
fful sauerly  er he were war of this
Abak he stirte  and þouȝt it was amys
ffor wele he wyst  a womman had no berd
he felt a thyng al row  and longe Ihered
And seide fy allas  what haue I do
  Te he quod she  and clapped the wyndowe to
And Absolon goth forth  a sory pace
A berd a berd  seide hende Nicholas
By goddes corpus  this goth fair and wele
This sely Absolon  herd euerydele
And on his lyppe  for anger he gan to byte
And to him self he seide  I shal the quyte
  Who rubbeth now  who froteth now hise lippes
With dust with sond with strawe with cloth with chippes
But Absolon that seith  ful ofte allas
My soule betake I  vnto Satanas
But me were leuere  than al this toun quod he
Of this dispyt  awreken for to be
Allas quod he  allas I ne hadde Iblent
his hote loue was cold  and al Iqueynt
ffor fro þat tyme  that he had kist hire ers
Of paramours  ne rought he nat a kers
ffor he was heled  of his maladye
fful ofte paramours  he gan defye
And wepe  as doth a child  þat is Ibete
A soft pas he went him  ouer the strete


Vnto a smyth  men callen daun Gerueys
That in his forge  smethed plough harneys
he sharpeth shaare  and cultur besily
This Absolon  knokketh  al esily
And seide  vndo Gerueys  and that anon  
What who art þow  it am I Absolon
What Absolon  what cristes swete tre
Why ryse ȝe so rathe  ey benedicite
What eyleth ȝow  some gay gerle god it wote
hath brought ȝow thus  vpon the veritote
By seynt Note  ȝe wot wel what I mene
This Absolon  ne rought nat a bene
Of al his pley  no word ageyn he ȝaf
he had more thought  on his distaf
Than Gerueys knew  and seide frend so dere
That hote culter  in the chemyny here
As lene it me  I haue therewith to done
I wol bryng it the  ageyn  ful sone
Gerueys answered  certes were it gold
Or in a poke  nobles al vntold
Thow shuldest haue  as I am trewe smyth
Ey cristes foo  what wol ȝe do therwyth
Thereof quod Absolon  be as be may
I shal wel telle it the  another day
And cauth the cultur  by the hote stele
fful softe ouȝt at the dore  he gan to stele
And went vnto  the Carpenteres wal
he kougheth first  and knokketh therwithal
vpon the wyndowe  right as he dede ere
This Alison answered  who is there
That knokketh so  I warant it is a thefe
Nay nay quod he  god wot my swete lefe
I am thyn Absolon  thy derlyng
Of gold quod he  I haue the brouȝt a ryng
My moder ȝaf it me  so god me saue
fful ffyne it is  and therto wel Igraue


This wol I ȝeue the  if thow me kysse
  This Nicholas  was risen vp  to pysse
He thought he wolde amende  al the Iape
he shulde kysse hise ars  er that he skape
And vp the wyndowe  he dide hastily
And ouȝt his ers  he putteth preuyly
Ouer the buttok  to the haunche bon
And therwith spak this Clerk  this Absolon
Speke swete brede  I not where thow art
  This Nicholas anon  let flee a fart
As gret as it had ben  a thonder dynt
That with the stroke  he was almost Iblynt
And he was redy  with his Iren hote  
And Nicholas  in the ars he smote
Of goth the skyn  an hanbrede aboute
The hote cultur  brent so his toute
That for the smert  he wend for to dye
As he were wode  for woo he gan to crye
help  water water  help for goddes hert
  This Carpenter  ouȝt of his slomer stert
And herd on crye water  as he were wode
And seide allas  now cometh Noes fflode
he sette him vp  withoute wordes moo
And with his ax  he smote the corde atwo
And doun goth al  he fond neither to selle
Brede ne Ale  tyl he cam to the Celle
vpon the flor  and there a swouȝne he lay
Vp stirt hire Alison  and Nicholay
And crieden ouȝt  and herrowe  in the strete
The neyghebores  bothe smale and grete
In ronnen  for to gawren  on this man
That in swownyng lay  bothe pale and wan
ffor with the fal  he broken had his arme
But stonde he must  vnto his owen harme
ffor whan he spak  he was anon born doun
With hende Nicholas  and Alisoun


They tolden euery man  that he was wode
he was so agast  of Noes flode
Thorugh fantasye  that of his vanyte
he had brought him  knedynge tubbes thre
And had hem hanged  in the rof aboue
And that he preyed hem  for goddes loue
To sitten in the rof  par companye
The folk gonne laughen  at his fantasye
Into the rof  they kekyn and they gape
And turned al his harm  vnto a Iape
ffor what so  þat this Carpenter  answered
It was for nought  no man his reson hered
with othes grete  he was so sworn adoun
That he was holden wod  in al the toun
ffor euery clerk  anon right  held with other
And seiden  the man was wod  my lef brother
And euery wyght gan laughen  of this striffe
Thus swyued was  the Carpenteres wyffe
ffor al his kepyng  and his Ielousye
And Absolon  hath kyssed  hire nether eye
And Nicholas is skalded  in the toute
This tale is don  and god saue al the routh quod Wytton  
WHanne folk han laughen  at þis nyce cas
Of Absolon  and hende Nicholas
Dyuerse folk  diuersly they seyde
But for the more part  they loughe and pleyde
Ne at this tale  I saw no man him greue
But it were oonly  Oswold the Reue
Bycause he was  of Carpenteres craft
A litel Ire  is  in his hert laft
he gan to grocche  and blamed it a lyte
So thike quod he  ful wel coude I the quyte
with bleryng  of a proude Milleres eye
If þat me list  to speke of rybaudye
But ik am old  me list nat pleye for age
Gras tyme is don  my foder is now forage
This white top  wryteth myne olde ȝeres
Myn hert is also  mouled  as myne heeres
But if I fare  as doth an open ars
That ilke fruyt  is euere lengere the wers
Til it be roten  in mullok or in stree
We olde men  I drede  so fare we
Til we be roten  kan we nat be rype
We hope alwey  while þat the world wol pipe
ffor in oure wyl  there steketh euere a nayl
To han an hore heer  and a grene tayl
As hath a leek  for though oure myght be gon
Oure wyl  desireth folye  euere in on
ffor whanne we moun nat don  than wol we speke
Ȝet in our asshen old  ys fire Ireke
ffoure gledes han we  which I shal deuyse
Auauntyng  lying  Angyr  Coueytise
Theise foure sparcles  longen vnto elde
Our olde lymes  moun wel ben vnwelde


But wyl ne shal faylen  that is soth
And ȝet haue ik alwey  a coltyssh toth
As many a ȝere  as it is passed henne
Sithe that my tappe  of lyf  bygan to renne
ffor sekirly  whan yk was born  anon
Deth drough the tapp of lyf  and let it gon
And euere sithe  hathe so  the tappe Ironne
Til that almost  al empty is the tonne
The streme of lyf  now droppeth on the chyme
The sely tonge  may wel rynge and chymbe
Of wrecchednesse  that passed is ful ȝore
With olde folk  saue  dotage is na more
  Whan þat our host  had herd this sermonyng
he gan to speke  as lordly as a kynge
And seide what amounteth al this wyt  
Why shuln we al day  speke of holy wryt
The deuele mad a Reue  for to preche
Or a Soutere  a shipman  or a leche
Sey forth thy tale  and tary nat the tyme
lo Depforde  and it is half weye pryme
lo Grenewyche  there many a shrewe is Inne
It were al tyme  thy tale to bygynne
Now Sires  quod this Oswold the Reue
I prey ȝow alle  that ȝe nat ȝow greue
Though I answere  and somdel sette his howe
ffor leueful is  with force  force of showe
This dronken Millere  hath told vs here
how that begyled was  a Carpentere
Parauenture in skorne  for I am one
And by ȝoure leue  I shal him quyte anone
Ryght in his cherles termes  wol I speke
I preye to god  his nekke mot tobreke
he can wel in myn eye  sen a stalke
But in his owen  he can nat sen a balke

At Trompyngton  nat fer fro Caumbrygge
There goth a broke  and ouer that a brygge
vpon the whiche broke  there stant a Mille
And this is verray soth  that I ȝow telle
A Millere was there  dwellyng many a day
As any Pecok  he was proud and gay
Pipe he coude and fisshe  and nettes bete
And turne cuppes  and wel wrestel and shete
Ay by his belt  he bar a long panade
And of a sword  ful trenchaunt was the blade
A Ioly poppere bar he  in his pouche
There was no man for paril durst him touche
A Shefeld whitel  bar he in his hose
Round was his face  and kamuse was his nose
As pilled as an Ape  was his skulle
he was a markete betere  at the fulle
There durst no wyght  hand vpon him legge
That he ne swor  he shulde anon abegge
A thef he was  forsothe  of corn and mele
And that a slye  and vsand for to stele
his name was hoten  deignous Symkyn
A wyf he hadde  comyn of noble kyn
The parson of the toun  hire fader was
With hire he ȝaf  ful many a panne of bras  
ffor that Symkyn  shulde in his blod alye
She was Ifostred  in a Nonnerye
ffor Symkyn nolde no wyf  as he said
But she were wel norisshed  and a mayd
To sauen his estate  of ȝemanrye
And she was proud  and pert as a pye
A ful fair sight  was it vpon hem two
On halidayes biforn hire  wold he go


with his typet wounde  aboute his hede
And she cam after  in a gyte of rede
And Symkyn had hosen  of the same
There durst no wyght  clepen hire but dame
was no so hardy  that went by the weye
That with hire durst rage  or ellis pleye
But if he wolde be slayn  of Symkyn
with panade  or with knyf  or boydekyn
ffor ielous folk  ben perilous euere mo
Algate they wold  here wyues wend so
And eke for she was  somdel smoterlich
She was as deigne  as water in a dich
So ful of hoker  and of bysmare
Hire þouȝt that a lady  shuld hire spare
what for hire kynrede  and hire norturye
That she had lerned  in the Nonnerye
  A doughter had they  bytwix hem two
Of twenty ȝere  withouten ony mo
Sauyng a child  þat was of half ȝere age
In cradel it lay  and was a propre page
This wenche thikke  and wel Igrowen was
with camuse nose  and eyen greye as glas
with bottokes brode  and brestes rounde and heye
But right fair was hire her  I wol nat lye
  The Parson of the toun  for she was fair
In purpose was  to maken hire his eyr
Bothe of his catel  and his mesuage
And straunge he mad it  of hire mariage
his purpos was  for to bystowen hire heye
Into som worthy blode  of Auncetrye
ffor holy chirche good  mot ben dispended
On holy chirche blod  that is descended
Therfore he wolde  his holy blod honoure
Though þat he  holy chirche  shuld deuoure
  Gret soken had this Millere  out of doute
with whete  and malt  of al the lond aboute


And namelich there was  a gret College  
Men clepen the Soler halle  of Caumbrygge
There was here whete  and eke here malt Igrounde
  And on a day  it happed in a stounde
Seke lay the Maunciple  on a maladie
Men wenden wysly  that he shulde deye
ffor which this Millere  stal bothe mele and corn
An hondred tymes more  than byforn
ffor there biforn  he stale but curteisly
But now he was a thef  outrageously
ffor which the wardeyn chide  and made fare
But þerof sette the Millere  nought a tare
he craketh bost  and swor it was nat so
  Thanne were there ȝonge  pore scoleres two
That dwelleden in the halle  of which I sey
Testyf they were  and lusty for to pley
And only for here myrthe  and reuelrye
vpon on the wardeyn  besily they crye
To ȝeue hem leue  but a litel stounde
To go to Mille  and sen here corn Igrounde
And hardily  they durst leyn here nekke
The Millere shuld nat stelen hem  half a pekke
Of corn  by sleight  ne by force hem reue
And at the last  the wardeyn ȝaf hem leue
Iohn hight þat one  and Aleyn hyght that other
Of on toun were they born  that hight Strother
ffer in the North  I can nat telle where
This Aleyn maketh redy  al his gere
And on an hors  the sakke he cast anon
fforth goth Aleyn the Clerk  and also Iohn
with good swerde and bokeler  by here syde
Iohn knew the weye  hem nedeth no gyde
And at the last  the sakke doun he layth
Aleyn spak first  al hayl Symond in fayth
how fares thy fair doughter  and thy wyf
  Aleyn welcome quod Symkyn  be my lyf


And Iohn also  how now what do ȝe here
By god quod Iohn  nede must  nede hath no pere
hym byhoues to serue him self  þat has na swayn
Or ellis he is a fool  as clerkes sayn
Oure Maunciple I hope  he wol be dede
Swa werkes ay  the wanges in his hede
And forthy is I come  and eke Alayn
To grynde oure corn  and carye mele agayn
I pray ȝow spede vs hethen  what ȝe may
  It shal be do quod Symkyn  be my fay
What wyl ȝe don  while þat it is in hand  
By god  right by the hoper  wyl I stand
Quod Iohn  and se how the corn gas In
Ȝet saw I neuere  be my fader kyn
how that the hoper  wagges tyl and fra
Aleyn answered  Iohn wylt thow swa
Than wyl I be bynethe  be my croun
And se how that the mele  falles doun
Intyl the trow  that shal be myn disport
ffor Iohn in faith  I may be of ȝoure sort
I is as ille a Myllere  as ar ȝe
  This Millere smyleth  at here nycete
And thought  al this nys  but for a wyle
They wene þat no man  may hem begyle
But be my thrift  ȝet shal I blere here eye
ffor al the sleight  in here philosophie
The more queynt crekes  that they make
The more wol I stele  whan I take
In stede of flour  ȝet wol I ȝeue hem bren
The grettest Clerkes  be nat the wysest men
As whilom to the wolf  thus spak the Mare
Of al here art  counte I nat a tare
Ouȝt at the dore  he goth ful preuyly
whan þat he sawgh his tyme  softly
he loketh vp and doun  til he had found
The Clerkes horse  there as it stod Ibound


Behynde the Mylle  vnder a lefselle
And to the hors  he goth him faire and wele
And strepeth of the brydel  right anon
And whan the hors was loos  he begynneth to gon
Toward the fen  there wylde Mares renne
And forth with we he  thorugh thikke and thenne
  This Millere goth ageyn  no word he seid
But doth his note  and with the Clerkes pleyd
Til that here corn  was faire and wel Igrounde
And whan the Mele is sakked  and Ibounde
This Iohn goth ouȝt  and fynt his hors awey
And gan to crye herrowe  and weylawey
Oure hors is lost  Aleyn  for goddes banes
Step on thy fete  come of man al at anes
Allas oure wardeyn  has his palfrey lorn
This Aleyn  al forgat  bothe Mele and corn
Al was oute of his mynde  his husbondrye
what whilk weye is he gan  he gan crye
The wyf cam lepyng inward  with a renne  
She seide allas  ȝoure hors goth to the fenne
with wylde Mares  as fast as he may go
Vnthank come on his hand  þat bond him so
And he þat betir  shuld han knyt the reyne
Allas quod Iohn  Aleyn for cristes peyne
lay doun thy swerd  and I wyl myn alswa
I is ful wyght  god wayt as is a raa
By goddes hert  he shal nat skape vs bathe
Why ne had thow put  the capul in the lathe
Il hayl  by god Aleyn  thow is a fonne
  Theise sely Clerkes  han ful fast Ironne
Toward the fen  bothe Aleyn and Iohn
And whanne the Millere saw  þat they weren gon
he half a busshel  of here flour hath take
And bad his wyf  go knede it in a kake
he seide I trowe  the Clerkes ben aferd
Ȝet can a Millere  make a Clerkes berd


ffor al his art  ȝa lat hem gon here wey
lo where they go  ȝe late the children pley
They get him nat  so lightly  be my croun
Theise sely Clerkes  rennen vp and doun
with kepe kepe  stand stand  Iossa warderere
Ga  whistel thow  and I shal kepe him here
But shortly  til it was verray nyght
They coude nat  though they dede al here myght
here capel cacche  he ran alwey so fast
Til in a diche  they cached him at the last
Wery and wete  as beest is in the reyn
Cometh sely Iohn  and with him cometh Aleyn
  Allas quod Iohn  that day that I was born
Now are we dreuyn til hethyng  and to skorn
Oure corn is stole  men wyl vs fonnes calle
Bothe the wardeyn  and our felawes alle
And namely the Millere  weylawey
Thus playneth Iohn  as he goth by the wey
Toward the Mille  and bayard in his hond
The Millere sittyng by the fyr  he fond
ffor it was nyght  and ferthere myght þei nought
But for the loue of god  they him bysought
Of herberwe and of ease  as for here peny
  The Millere seide ageyn  if here be eny
Swich as it is  ȝet shuln ȝe han ȝoure part
Myn hous is streyt  but ȝe han lerned art
Ȝe conne by argumenteȝ  maken a place
A myle brod  of twenty fote of space  
late se now  if this place may suffice
Or make it roume  with speche  as is ȝoure gyse
  Now Symond seide this Iohn  by Seynt Cutberd
Ay is thow mery  and þat is feir answerd
I haue herd sey  men sal ta  of twa thynges
Slike as he fyndes  or ta slike as he brynges
But specialy  I pray the Host dere
Gar vs haue mete and drynk  and make vs chere


And we sal paie trewely  at the fulle
With empty hand  men moun na haukes tulle
lo here oure siluer  redy for to spende
  This Millere  to the toun  his doughter sende
ffor ale and brede  and rosted hem a goos
And bond here hors  it shulde no more go loos
And in his owen chaumbre  hem mad a bed
With shetes  and with chalons  faire Ispred
Nat fro his owen bed  ten fote or twelue
His doughter had a bed  al by hire selue
Right in þe same chaumbre  by and by
It myght be no bet  and cause why
There was no roumere herberwe  in the place
They soupen  and they speken of solace
And drynken euere strong ale  at the best
Aboute mydnyght  went they to rest
  Wel hath this Millere  vernysshed his hede
fful pale he was  fordronke  and nat rede
he ȝesketh  and he speketh thorugh the nose
As he were on the quak  or on the pose
To bedde he goth  and with him goth his wyf
As ony Iay  she light was and iolyf
So was hire ioly whistel  wel Iwette
The cradel at hire beddes fete  is shette
To rokken  and to ȝeue the child souke
And whan þat dronken al was  in the crouke
To bedde went the doughter  right anon
To bedde goth Aleyn  and also Iohn
There was nomore  hem nedeth no dwale
This Millere hath so wysely  bybed ale
That as an hors  he snorteth in his slepe
Ne of his tayl behynde  he toke no kepe
His wyf bar him a burdon  a ful strong
Men myght here routyng heren  a furlong
The wenche routed eke  par compaignye
  Aleyn the Clerk  that herd this melodye


He poked Iohn  and seide slepes thow
Herd thow euere slike a sang  or now
Lo slike a complyng  is ymell hem alle  
A wylde fyr  on theire bodies falle
Wha herd euere  slike a ferly thyng
Ȝe they sal haue  the flour of euele endyng
This lang nyght  ne tydes me na rest
But ȝet na force  al sal be for the best
ffor Iohn seide he  as euere mot I thryue
If þat I may  ȝone lasse wol I swyue
Som easement  has lawe shapen vs
ffor Iohn there is a lawe  that seith thus
That gyf a man  in a poynt be greued
That in another  he shal be releued
Oure corn is stolen  sothly it is na nay
And we han had  an ylle fyt this day
And syn I sal haue  nan amendement
Agayn my losse  I wyl haue an easement
By goddes saule  it sal nan other be
  This Iohn answered  Aleyn avyse the
The Millere is a parlious man  he seide
And gyf that he  ouȝt of his slepe breyde
he myght do vs bathe  a velanye
Aleyn answered  I counte him nat a flye
vp he rist  and by the wenche he crepte
This wenche lay vpright  and faste slepte
Til he so ny was  er she myght aspye
That it had ben to late  for to crye
And shortly for to seyn  they were at on
Now pley Aleyn  for I wyl speke of Iohn
  This Iohn lith stille  a forlong wey or two
And to him self  he maketh reuthe and woo
Allas quod he  this is  a wykked Iape
Now may I sey  that I is but an Ape
Ȝet has my felawe  somwhat for his harm
he has the Milleres doughter  in his arm


he auntred him  and has his nedes spedde
And I ly as a drafsakke  in my bedde
And whan this iape  is tald another day
I sal be halden a daffe  a Cokenay
I wyl aryse  and auntre it be my feith
vnhardy  is vnsely  thus men seith
And vp he roos  and softly he went
Vnto the cradel  and in his hand it hent
And bar it softe  vnto his beddes fete
  Sone after this  the wyf hire routyng lete
And gan awake  and went hire ouȝt to pisse
And cam ageyn  and gan hire cradel mysse
And groped here and there  and she fond non  
Allas quod she  I had almost mysgon
I had almost gon  to the Clerkes bedde
Ey benedicite  than had I foule spedde
And forth she goth  til she the cradil fonde
She gropeth alwey  ferthere with hire honde
And fond the bed  and þouȝt nat but good
Bycause that the cradil  by it stod
And nyst where she was  for it was derke
And faire and wele  she crepte in by the clerke
And lith ful stille  and wold han caught a slepe
withInne a while  this Iohn the Clerk vp lepe
And on this goode wyf  he leyd on sore
So mery a fit  ne had she nat ful ȝore
he pryketh hard  and depe  as he were mad
This ioly lyf  han theise two Clerkes lad
Til þat the iij Cok  bygan to synge
  Aleyn wex wery  in the morwenynge
ffor he had swonken  al the longe nyght
And seide  fare wel Malkyn  swete wyght
The day is come  I may no lengere byde
But euere more  where so I go or ryde
I is thyn owen Clerk  so haue I seele
  Now dere lemman quod she  go fare wele


But er thow go  o thyng I wyl the telle
Whan that þou wendest homward  by the Mille
Right at the entre  of the dore behynde
Thow shalt a cake  of a busshel fynde
That was Imaked  of thyn owen Mele
which þat I halpe  my sire for to stele
And good lemman  god the saue and kepe
And with that word  almost he gan to wepe
  Aleyn vp ryst  and thought er þat it dawe
I wyl go crepe in  be my felawe
And fond the cradil  at his hand anon
By god quod he  al wrang I had mysgon
Myn hed is toty  of my swynk tonyght
That makes me  that I go nat aright
I wat wel by the Cradel  I haue mysgaa
he lyes the Millere  and his wyf alswa
  And forth he goth  a twenty deuele way
Vnto the bedde  þere as the Millere lay
he wend han cropen  by his felawe Iohn
And by the Millere  In he crepe anon
And caught him by þe nekke  and softe he spake
He seide thow Iohn  þow swyneshede awake  
ffor cristes soule  and here a noble game
ffor by that lord  that called is Seynt Jame
As I haue thries  in this short nyght
Swyued the Milleres doughter  bolt vpright
While thow hast  as a coward  ben agast
  Ȝe fals harlot  quod the Millere hast
A fals traytour  fals Clerk quod he
Thow shalt be ded  by goddis dignyte
Who durst be so bold  to disparage
My doughter  þat is come  of swich lynage
And by the throte bolle  he caught Aleyn
And he hent him  dispetously ageyn
And on the nose  he smot him with his fist
Doun ran the blody strem  vpon his brest


And in the flore  with nose and mouth tobroke
They walwen  as don  tweyne pygges in a poke
And vp they gon  and doun ageyn anon
Til þat the Millere  spurned at a ston
And doun he fel bakward  vpon his wyf
That wyst no thyng  of this nyce stryf
ffor she was falle aslepe  a litel wyght
with Iohn the Clerk  that waked had al nyght
And with the fal  out of hire slepe she breyde
help holy croys of Bromholme  she seide
In manus tuas  lord to the I calle
Awake Symkyn  the fend is on me falle
Myn hert is broken  help I nam but dede
There lith vpon my wombe  and on myn hede
help Symkyn  for the fals Clerkes fight
  This Iohn stirt vp  als fast as euere he myght
And gropeth by the walles  to and fro
To fynde a staf  and she stert vp also
And knew the estres  bet þanne dide this Iohn
And by the wal  a staf she fond anon
And saw a litel slemeryng  of a light
ffor at an hole  in shon the Mone bright
And by þat light  she saw hem bothe two
But sekerly she nyst  who was who
But as she saw  a whit þing in hire eye
And whan she gan  this white þing aspie
She wende the Clerk  had wered a volupere
And with the staf  she drow ay nere and nere
And wend han hit  this Aleyn at the fulle
And smot the Millere  on the pyled skulle
That doun he goth  and cried Harrow I dye  
Theise Clerkes  bete hym wele  and lete him lye
And ordeyned hem  and toke here hors anon
And eke here mele  and on here weye they gon
And at the Mille  ȝet they toke here cake
Of half a busshel flour  ful wel Ibake


  Thus is the proud Millere  wel Ibete
And hath Ilost  the gryndyng of the whete
And paid for þe sopere  euerydele
Of Aleyn and of Iohn  þat beten him wele
his wyf is swyued  and his doughter als
lo  swich it is  a Millere to be fals
And þerfore  this prouerbe  is seid ful soth
hym thar nat wene wel  that euele doth
A gylour  shal himself  begyled be
And got þat sitteth heye  in mageste
Saue al this companye  grete and smale
Thus haue I quyt the Millere  in my tale
The Cok of london  while the Reve spak
ffor ioye him þought  he clawed him on the bak
A ha quod he  for cristes passion
This Millere hadde  a sharp conclusion
Vpon this argument  of herberwegage
wel seide Salamon  in his langage
Ne bryng nat euery man  into thyn hous
ffor herberwyng by nyght  is parlyous
Wel ought a man  avysed for to be
Whom that he brought  into his preuyte
I preye to god  so ȝeue me sorwe and care
If euere sithe  I hight hogge of ware
Herde I a Millere  bettir sette awerke
He hedde a iape of Malice  in the derke
But god forbede  that we stynten here
And therfore  if ȝe wouchensaf to here
A tale of me  that am a pore man
I wol ȝow telle  as wel as euere I can
A litel iape  that fel in oure Citee
  Oure host answered  and seide  I graunte it the
Now telle on Roger  and loke þat it be good
ffor many a paste  hast thow laten blod
And many a Iakke of Dover  hast thow sold
That hath ben twyes hot  and twyes cold
Of many a pilgrym  hast thow cristes curs  
ffor of thy parselee  ȝet they fare the wers
That they han eten  in thy stobel goos
ffor in thy shoppe  is many a flye loos
Now telle on gentil Roger  be thy name
But ȝet I preye the  be nat wroth for game
And man may sey ful soth  in game and pleye
  Thow seist ful soth  quod Roger  be my feye


But swhich pley  quade pley  as the fflemmyng seith
And þerfore herry Bailly  be thy feith
Be thow nat wroth  er we departe heere
Though that my tale  be of an hostelere
But natheles  I wol nat telle it ȝet
But er we parte  Iwysse þou shalt be quyt
And therwithalle  he lough and made chere
And seide his tale  as ȝe shuln after here
A Prentys whilom  dwelled in oure Citee
Of a craft  of vetayleres was he
And Gaillard was he  as a Goldffynch in þe shawe
Broun as a Bery  a propre short felawe
With lokkes blake  kembed ful fetisly
Daunce he koude  so wel and iolyly
That he was cleped  Perkyn reuelour
he was as ful of loue  and paramour
As is the hyue  ful of hony swete
Wel was the wenche  with him myght mete
At euery brydale  wold he synge and hoppe
He loued bet the tauerne  þan the shoppe
ffor whan there ony ridyng was in Chepe
Out of the shoppe  thider wold he lepe
Til þat he had  al the sight Iseyn
And daunced wele  he nolde nat come ageyn
And gadred him a meyne  of his sort
To hoppe and synge  and make swich disport
And there they setten steuene  for to mete
To play at the dys  in swich a strete
ffor in the Toun  nas there no Prentys
That fairere coude kast  a peyre of Dys
Than Perkyn coude  and therto he was free
Of hys dispence  in place of preuyte
That fond his Maister wel  in his chaffare
ffor oft tyme he fond  his box ful bare  
ffor sothly  a Prentys a Reuelour
That haunteth Dys  riot  and Paramour
his maister shal it  in his shoppe abye
Al haue he no part  of the Mynstralsye
ffor theft and riot  they ben conuertible
Al can he pleye  on gyterne or ribible


Reuel and trouthe  as in a lowe degre
They ben ful wrothe  al day  as men may se
  This ioly Prentis  with his maister stode
Til he was ny  out of his Prentyshode
Al were he snybbed  bothe erly and late
And somtyme lad  with reuel to Newgate
But at the last  his Maister him bythought
Vpon a day  whan he his paper sought
Of a prouerbe  that seith this same word
Wel bet is roten Appel  out of hord
Than that he rote  al the remenaunt
So fareth it  by a riotous seruaunt
It is ful lasse harm  to late him passe
Than he shende alle  the seruauntes in the place
Therfore his Maister  ȝaf him acquietance
And bad him go  with sorwe  and with meschaunce
And thus this ioly Prentys  had his leue
Now late him riote  al the nyght  or leue
And for there nys no thef  withoute a louke
That helpeth him  to wasten and to souke
Of that he bribe can  or borwe may
Anon he sent his bed  and his array
Vnto a Compere  of his owen sorte
That loued Dys  ryot and desporte
And had a wyf  þat held for countenaunce
A shoppe  and swyued for hire sustenaunce  
Oure Host saw wel  þat the bright sonne
The ark of his artificiale day  hath ronne
The ferthe part  and half an oure and more
And thought he were not  depe Istert in lore
He wist it was  the eight and twenty day
Of Aprill  that is messanger vnto May
And saw wel  þat the shadewe of euery tree
was as in lengthe  the same quantite
That was the body erecte  that causet it
And þerfore by the shadewe  he tok his wyt
That phebus  which þat shone  so clere and bright
Sixe degrees was fyue and fourty clombe on height
And for that day  as in that latitude
It was ten of the clok  he gan conclude
And sodeynly he plight  his hors aboute
lordynggis quod he  I warne ȝow alle this route
The ferthe partie of this day  is gon
Now for the loue of god  and of Seynt Iohn
leseth no tyme  as ferforth as ȝe may
lordyngges the tyme wasteth  nyght and day
And steleth from vs  what preuyly slepynge
And what þorugh negligence  in our wakynge
As doth the strem  that turneth neuere ageyn
Descendyng fro the mounteyn  into a pleyn
Wel can Senek  and many a Philosophre
Bywaylen tyme  more than gold in coffre
ffor losse of catel  may recouered be
But losse of tyme  shendeth vs quod he


It wyl not comen ageyn  withouten drede
No more than wyl  Malkyns maydenhede
Whan she hath lost it  in hire wantounesse
lat vs nought mowlen thus  in Idelnesse
Sire man of lawe quod he  so haue ȝe blisse
Tells vs a tale anon  as forward isse
Ȝe ben submytted  thurgh ȝoure free assent
To stonden in this cas  at my Iugement
Acquiteth ȝow now  of ȝoure byhest
Than han ȝe don  ȝoure deuer at the lest
host quod he  de par dieux iche assent
To breke forward  is not myn entent
Byhest is dette  and I wol holde fayne
Al my behest  I can no betre sayne
ffor swich lawe as a man ȝeueth  anoþer wyght  
he shulde him selue vsen it  be right
Thus wyl oure text  but natheles certeyn
I can right now  no thrifty tale seyn
But Chaucer  though he can but lewedly
On meetris  and on rymyng craftily
hath seid hem  in swich englissh as he can
Of olde tyme  as knoweth many a man
And if he haue nouȝt seid hem  leue brother
In a boke  he hath seid hem  in another
ffor he hath told of louyers  vp and downe
Moo than Ouyde made of  mencione
In hise epistles  than ben ful olde
What shulde I telle hem  syn they ben tolde
In ȝouthe he made  of Ceys and Alcione
And sithen hath he spoken  of euerychone
Theise noble wyues  and theise louyers eke
Who so þat wyl  his large volume seke
Cleped the Seyntes legende  of cupide
There may he sen  the large woundes wyde
Of lucresse  and of babilan Tesbe
The swerd of Dido  for the fals Ene


The tree of phillis  for hir demophon
The pleynte of Diane  and of Hermyon
Of Adriane  and Isiphilee
The baraigne Isle  stondyng in the see
The dreynte leandre  for his erro
And teeres of Eleyne  and eke the woo
Of Brixseide  and of the ladomya
The cruelte  of the Quene Medea
Thy litel children hangynge  by the hals
ffor thy Ioson  that was of loue so fals
Of Parmystre  Penelape Alceste
Ȝoure wyfhode  ȝe comende with the beste
But certeynly  no word wryteth he
Of thilke wykked ensaumple  of Canacee
That loued hire owen brother  synfully
Of swiche cursed stories  I seye fy
Or ellis of Tiro  Appollonius
how þat the cursed kyng  Antiochus
Biraft hire doughter  of hire maydenhede
That is so horrible a tale  for to rede
Whan he hire threwe  vpon the paument
And therfore he  of ful auysement  
Nolde neuere wryte  in none of hise sermouns
Of swich vnkynde  abhominacions
Ne I wyl noon reherce  if þat I may
But of my tale  how shal I don this day
Me were loth  be likned doutelees
To muses  þat men clepe pierides
Methamorphosios  woot what I mene
But natheles  I recche not a bene
Though I come after him  with hawe bake
I speke in prose  and lat him rymes make
And with that word  he with a sober chere
Bygan his tale  as ȝe shuln after here
O Hateful harme  condicione of pouerte
with thrust with cold  with honger so confounded
To asken helpe  the shameth in thyn herte
If thow noon aske  so sore art þow Iwounded
That verray nede  vnwrappeth alle thy wounde hid
Maugre thyn heede  thow must for indigence
Or stele or begge  or borwe thyn dispence
 Thow blamest crist  and seist ful bitterly

Thy neyghebore  thow wytest synfully
And seist þou hast to lite  and he hath al
Parfey seist þou  sumtyme he rekne shal
Whan þat his taylle  shal brennen in the glede
ffor he nought helpeth  nedeful in here nede
 Herkeneth what is the sentence  of the wyse
Bette is to deyen  than haue indigence
Thy selue neyghebore  wyl the despise
If thow be pore  fare wel thy reuerence
Ȝet if the wyse man  take this sentence
Alle the dayes of poore men  ben wykke
Be war þerfore  er þou come to þat prikke
 If þou be pore  thy brother hateth the
And alle thyne frendes  flen fro the  allas
O riche marchaunteȝ  ful of wele ben ȝe
O noble o prudent folk  as in this cas
Ȝoure bagges be nouȝt filled  with aumbesas
But with sys synk  þat renneth for ȝoure chaunce
At Cristemasse  merie may ȝe daunce  

 Ȝe seken lond and see  for ȝoure wynnynges
As wyse folk ȝe knowen  alle the estat
Of regnes  ȝe ben fadres of tidynges
And tales  both of pees and of debat
I were right now  of tales desolat
Ner that a Marchaunt  gon is many a ȝere
Me taught a tale  which þat ȝe shal here

 In Surrye whilom  dwelled a companye
Of chapmen riche  and therto sad and trewe
That wyde where  senten here spicerye
Clothes of gold  of satyn  riche of hewe
here chaffare was so thrifty  and so newe
That euery wyght  hath deynte to chaffare
With hem  and eke to sellen hem here ware
 Now fel it  þat the maistres of þat sorte
Han shapen hem  to Rome for to wende
Were it for chapmanhod  or for disport
Non other message  wold they thidder sende
But comen hem selue  to Rome  this is the ende
And in swich place  as thought hem auauntage
ffor here entente  they take here herbergage
 Soiourned han theise Marchauntȝ  in that toun
A certayne tyme  as fel to here plesaunce
And so byfel  that the excellent renoun
Of the Emperoures doughter  Dame Custaunce
Reported was  with euery circumstaunce
Vnto theise Surryen Marchauntȝ  in swich a wyse
ffro day to day  as I shal ȝow deuyse
 This was the comune voys  of euery man
Oure Emperoure of Rome  god him se
A doughter hath  that syn the world bygan
To rekne as wel hire goodnesse  as beaute
Nas neuere swich another  as is she
I preye to god in honour  hire sustene
And wolde she were  of al Europe the Quene

 In hire is heigh beaute  withouten pride
Ȝouthe withouten greenheede  or of folye
To alle hire werkes  vertu is hire gyde
Humblesse hath slayn in hire  al tirannye
She is myrour  of al curteisye
hir herte is verrey chaumbre  of holynesse
hir  and Ministre  of freedom  for almesse
 And al this voys was soth  as god is trewe
But now to purpos  lat vs turne agayne
Theise Marchauntȝ han don fraught here sheppes newe
And whan they han  this blisful mayden sayne  
Hom to Surrye  ben they went ful fayne
And don here nedes  as they han don ȝore
And lyuen in wele  I can sey ȝow no more
 Now fel it  that theise Marchauntȝ stoden in grace
Of hym þat was  the Soudon of Surrie
That whan they come  fro any straunge place
he wolde of his benygne  curteisie
Make hem good cheer  and bisily aspie
Tidynges  of sondry regnes for to lere
The wondres that they  myght seen or here
 Amonges othere thynges specially
Theise Marchauntȝ han him told  of Dame Custaunce
So greet noblesse  in ernest ceriously
That this Soudan hath caught  so gret plesaunce
To han hire figure  in his remembraunce
That al his lust  and his besy cure
was for to loue hire  while his lif may dure
 Parauenture  in thilke large boke
which þat men clepe  the heuene  Iwryten was
with sterres  whan that he his birthe toke
That he for loue  shulde han his deth allas


ffor in the sterres clerere  than is glas
Iwryten is god wot  who so coude it rede
The deth of euery man  withouten drede
 In sterres  many a wynter there biforn
was wretyn the deth  of Ector Achilles
Of pompey Iulyus  er they were born
The strif of Thebes  and of Hercules
Of Sampson  Turnus  and of Socrates
The deth  but mennes wyttes ben so dulle
That no wyght can wel rede it  at the fulle
 This Soudan  for his pryue counseil sent
And shortly of this mater  for to pace
he hath to hem declared  his entent
And seide hem certeyn  but he myght han grace
To haue Custaunce  withinne a litel space
he nas but dede  and charged hem in hye
To shapen for his lyf  som remedye
 Diuerse men  diuerse thynges seiden
They Argumentȝ cast  vp and doun
Many a subtile reson  forth they leiden
They spoken of magyk  and of abusione
But finally  as in conclusione
Thei can nat sen  in that non auauntage  
As in none other wey  saue in mariage
 Than saw they þereInne  swich difficulte
By weye of reson  for to speke al pleyne
By cause that there was  swiche diuersite
Bytwene here bothe lawes  that they seyne
They trowe that no cristene prince  wolde feyne
wedden his childe  vnto our lawes swete
That vs was taught  by Mahoum oure prophete


 And he answered  rather than I lese
Custaunce  I wol be cristened doutelesse
I mot ben hires  I may noon other chese
I prey ȝow  holde ȝoure argumenteȝ in pes
Saueth my lyf  and beth nought reccheles
To getyn hire  that hath my lyf in cure
ffor in this woo  I may not longe endure
 what nedeth grettere  dilatacione
I seye be tretys  and embassatrye
And by the Popes  mediacione
And alle the chirche  and al the chyualrie
That in destruccione  of maumentrie
And in encresse  of cristes lawe dere
They ben accorded  so as ȝe shuln here
 how þat the Soudan  and his baronage
And alle hise lieges  shulde Icristened be
And he shal haue Custaunce  in mariage
And certeyne gold  I not what quantite
And her to founden  sufficeant seurte
This same accord  was sworn on either syde
Now fair Custaunce  almyghty god the gyde
 Now wolde summe men  wayten as I gesse
That I shulde tellen  al the purueance
That the Emperour  of his grete noblesse
hath shapen for his doughter  Dame Custaunce
wel may men knowen  that so grete ordinaunce
May no man telle  in a litel clause
As was arrayed  for so heygh a cause
 Bisshopes ben shapen  with hire for to wende
lordes ladies  knyghtes of renoune
And othere folk Inowe  this is the ende
And notified is  thurghouȝt the toun


That euery wyght  with gret deuocion
Shulde preyen crist  that he this mariage
Receyue in gree  and spede this viage
 The day is comen  of here departynge  
I say the wooful day  fatal  is come
That there may be  no lengere tariynge
And forthward they hem dressen  alle and some
Custaunce that was  with sorwe al ouercome
fful pale arist  and dressith hire to wende
ffor wel she seth  þere is noon other ende
 Allas what wonder is it  though she wepte
That shal be sent  to straunge nacione
ffro frendes  þat so tenderly hire kepte
And to be bounde  vnder subieccione
Of oon  she knoweþ nouȝt  his condicione
housbondes ben alle goode  and han ben ȝore
That knowen wyues  I dar sey ȝow no more
 ffader she seide  thy wrecched child Custaunce
Thy ȝonge doughter  fostred vp so softe
And ȝe my moder  my souereigne plesaunce
Ouer alle thynge  outtake crist on loft
Custaunce ȝoure child  hire recomaundeth oft
vnto ȝoure grace  for I shal to Surrye
Ne shal I neuere  sen ȝow more with eye
 Allas vnto the barbre  nacione
I must goon  syn that it is ȝoure wylle
But crist that starf  for oure sauacione
So ȝeue me grace  hise hestes to fulfille
I wrecched womman  no fors though I spille
Wommen arn born  to thraldom and penaunce
And to ben  vnder mannes gouernance


 I trowe at Troye  whan Pirrus brak the wal
Or ylyon brende  Thebes the Citee
Ne at Rome  for the harme thurgh hanybal
That Romeyns han venquyssed  tymes three
Nas herd  swich tendre wepynge  for pitee
As in the chaumbre was  for hire departynge
But forth she moot  wheiþer so she wepe or synge
 O first meeuing  cruel firmament
With thy dyurnal sweigh  that crowdest ay
And hurlest alle  fro Est til occident
That naturelly wolde holde  another wey
Thy crowdyng sette the heuene  in swich array
At the begynnynge  of this fiers viage
That cruel Mars  hath slayn this mariage
 Infortunat ascendent tortuous
Of which the lord  is helplees falle allas
Ouȝt of his angle  into the derkest hous
O Mars o Athasir  as in this cas  
O feble Mone  vnhappy ben thy paas
Thow knyttest the  there þou art nought receyued
There þou were wel  fro thens art þou weyued
 Imprudent Emperour  of Rome  allas
Was þere no philosophre  in al thy toune
Is no tyme bet than other  in swich a caas
Of viage  is þere noon eleccione
Namely to folk  of heigh condicione
Nought whan a root  is of birthe Iknowe
Allas we ben to lewed  or to slowe
 To shippe is brought  this wooful fair mayde
Solempnely  with euery circumstaunce
Now ihesu crist  be with ȝow alle she sayde
There nys namore  but farewel fair Custaunce


She peyneth hire  to make good countenaunce
And forth I lete hire seyle  in this manere
And turne I wyl ageyn  to my matere
 The moder of the Soudan  welle of vices
Aspied hath  hire sones pleynt entent
How he wolde lete  his olde sacrifys
And right anoon  she for hire counseil sent
And they ben come  to knowe what she ment
And whan assembled was  this folk in fere
She sette hire doun  and seyde as ȝe shuln here
 lordes she seide  ȝe knowen euerychone
How that my sone  in poynt is for to lete
The holy lawes  of oure Alkarone
Ȝouen by goddes messanger  Macamete
But oon avow  to grete god I hete
The lif shal rather  out of my body stert
Er Macametes lawe  out of myn hert
 what shulde vs tiden  of this newe lawe
But thraldome to oure bodies  and penaunce
And afterward in helle  to ben drawe
ffor we reneyed Mahoun  oure creaunce
But lordes wol ȝe maken  asseuraunce
As I shal seyn  assentyng to my loore
And I shal make vs saf  for euere more
 They sworn and assentyn  euery man
To liue with hire and deye  and by hire stonde
And euerich  in the best wyse  he can
To strengthe hire  shal alle hise frendes fonde
And she hath this emprise  Itake on honde
which ȝe shal heren  that I shal deuyse
And to hem alle  she spak right in this wyse  

 we shuln first feyne vs  cristendome to take
Cold water shal nouȝt greue vs  but a lite
And I shal swich a feest  and reuel make
That as I trowe  I shal the Soudan quyte
ffor though his wyf be cristened  neuere so whyte
She shal haue nede  to wasshe awey the rede
Though she a fontful water  with hire lede
 O Soudanesse  roote of iniquite
Virago thow semirame  the secounde 
O serpent  vnder femynynytee
like to the serpent  depe in helle Ibounde
O feyned womman  al that may confounde
Vertue and innocence  thurgh thy malice
Is bred in the  as neste of euery vyce
 O Sathan enuyous  syn thilke day
That thow were chased  from oure heritage
wel knowest þou  to wommen the olde way
Thow madest Eue  brynge vs in seruage
Thow wylt fordon  this cristene mariage
Thyn instrument  so welawey the whyle
Makest þou of wommen  whan þou wylt begyle
 This Soudanesse  whom I thus blame and warye
leet pryuyly hire counseil  gon here way
what shulde I in this tale  lengere tary
She rideth to the Soudan  on a day
And seide him that she wolde  reneye hire lay
And cristendome  of prestes handes fonge
Repentynge hire  she hethene was so longe
 Bysechyng him  to don hire that honour
That she must han  the cristene folk to fest
To plesen hem  I wyl do my labour
The Soudan seith  I wyl don at ȝoure hest


And knelynge thanketh hire  of that request
So glad was he  he nyst what to seye
She kist hire sone  and hom she goth hire weye
 Aryued ben  theise cristene folk to londe
In Surrye  with a gret solempne route
And hastilich this Soudan  sent his sonde
ffirst to his moder  and al the regne aboute
And seide  his wyf was comen  out of doute
And preyede hire for to ride  ageyne the Quene
The honour of his regne  to sustene
 Greet was the prees  and riche was the Arraye
Of Surreyens and Romayns  mette Ifeere
The moder of the Soudan  riche and gay  
Receyueth hire  with al so glad a chere
As any moder myght  hire doughter deere
And to the next Citee  there beside
A softe paas  solempnely they ride
 Nought trowe I  the triumphe of Iulius
Of which that lucan  maketh swich a boost
Was reallere  or more curious
Than was the assemble  of this blisful oost
But this scorpion  this wykked gost
The Soudanesse  for al hire flaterynge
Cast vnder this  ful mortally to stynge
 The Soudan cometh him selue  sone after þis
So really  that wonder is to telle
he welcometh hire  with alle ioye and blisse
And thus in myrthe and ioye  I lat hem dwelle


The fruyt of this mater  is that I telle
Whan tyme come  men thouȝt it for the best
That reuel stynt  and men gon to here rest
 The tyme come  this olde Soudanesse
Ordeyned had this fest  of whiche I tolde
And to the feest  cristen folk hem dresse
In general  ȝe bothe ȝonge and olde
here moun men feest  and realte beholde
And deyntees moo  than I can ȝow deuyse
But al to dere  they bought it er they ryse
 O sodeyn woo  that euere art successour
To worldly blisse  spreynde with bitternesse
The ende of the ioye  of oure worldly labour
woo  occupieth the fyn  of oure gladnesse
herkene this counseil  for thy sekirnesse
vpon thy glad day  haue in thy mynde
The vnwar woo  or harm  þat cometh behynde
 ffor shortly to tellen  at a word
The Soudan  and the cristene euerichone
Ben al tohewe  and stiked at the bord
But it were oonly  dame Custaunce allone
This olde Soudanesse  cursed crone
hath with hire frendes  doon this cursed dede
ffor she hire selue wolde  al the contree lede
 Ne was Surryen noon  that was conuerted
That of the counseil  of the Soudan woot
That he nas al tohewe  er he asterted
And Custaunce han they take  anone foot hoot
And in a shippe  al steereles god woot
They han hire sette  and bidden hire lerne saile  
Out of Surrie  ageynward to Itaile


 A certeyn tresore  that she thidder ladde
And sothe to seyn  vitaille gret plentee
They han hire ȝeuen  and clothes eke she hadde
And forth she seileth  in the salt See
O my Custaunce  ful of benignytee
O Emperoures  ȝonge doughter deere
he þat is lord ouer fortune  be thy steere
 She blissed hire  and with ful pitous vois
Vnto the Croos of crist  thus seide she
O cleer  o welful auter  holy croys
Reed of the lambes blood  ful of pitee
That wesshe the world  fro þe olde iniquite
Me fro the fende  and fro his clawes kepe
That day þat I shal drenchen  in the depe
 Victorious tree  proteccione of trewe
That oonly worthy were  for to bere
The kyng of heuene  with hise woundes newe
The whit lamb þat hurt was  with a spere
fflemer of feendes  out of him and heere
On which thy lymes  feithfully extenden
Me kepe  and ȝeue me myght  my lif to amenden
 Ȝeres and dayes  fleetith this creature
Thurghout the see  of Grece  vnto the strayte
Of Marrok  as it was hire auenture
O many sory meel  now may she bayte
After hire deth  ful often may she wayte
Er that the wylde wawes  wyln hire dryue
Vnto the place  there she shal arryue
 Men myght asken  why she was nouȝt slayne
Eke atte feest  whoo myght hire body saue
And I answere  to that demaunde agayne
Who saued Danyel  in the horrible caue


There euery wyght saw he  maister and knaue
Was with the leoun  freet  er he asterte
No wyght but god  that he bar in his herte
 God list to shewe  his wonderful myracle
In hire  for we shulde  seen his mighty werkes
Crist which þat is  to euery harm triacle
By certeyn menes oft  as knowen clerkes
Doth thyng for certeyn ende  that ful derk is
To mannes wyt  that for oure ignoraunce
Ne konne nought knowe  his prudent purueaunce
 Now sithe she was nought  at the feest Islawe
Who kepte hire fro the drenchynge in the See  
Who kepte Ionas  in the fysshes mawe
Til he was spouted vp  at Nynyuee
wel may men knowe  it was no wyght but hee
That kepte peeple Ebrayk  fro here drenchynge
With drye feet  thurghout the see passynge
 Who bad the foure spiriteȝ  of tempest
That power han  to anoyen lond and see
Bothe North and south  and also west and Est
Anoyeth neither see  ne lond ne tree
Sothely the comaundour  of that was he
That fro the tempest  ay this womman kepte
As wel whan she wook  as whan she slepte
 Where myght this womman  mete and drynk haue
Thre ȝer and more  how lasteth hire vetaille
who fedde the egipciene Marye  in the caue
Or in desert  no wyght but crist saunȝ faille
ffyue thousand folk  it was as gret meruaylle
With loues fyue  and fisshes two to fede
God sent his foyson  at here grete nede


 She dryueth forth  in to oure occeane
Thurghout oure wylde see  til at the laste
Vnder an hold  that nempnen I ne can
ffer in Northumberlond  the wawe hire caste
And in the sond  hire ship stiked so faste
That thens wold it nought  of al a tyde
The wyl of criste was  that she shulde abyde
 The Constable of the Castel  doun is fare
To sen his wrek  and al the ship he sought
And fond this wery womman  ful of care
he fond also  the tresor þat she brought
In hire langage  mercy she bysought
The lyf out of hire body  for to twynne
hire to delyuere of woo  that she was Inne
 A maner latyn corupt  was hire speche
But algates therby  was she vnderstonde
The Constable whan him list  no lengere seche
This wooful womman  brought he to the londe
She kneleth doun  and thanketh goddes sonde
But what she was  she wold noman say
ffor foule ne fayr  though that she shulde deye
 She seide she was  mased in the See
That she forgat  hir mynde be hire trouthe
The Constable hath of hire  so gret pitee
And eke his wyf  that þei wepen for routhe
She was so diligent withouten sleuth
To serue and plese euerycch in that place
That all hir loven that loken in hir face
 This Constable and Dame Hermengild his wif
Weren payens  and þat cuntre euery where
But Hermengild loued hir right as hir lyf
And Custaunce hath so long soiourned þere


In orisons with many a bitter tere
Till Ihesu hath conuerted thurgh his grace
Dame Hermengild Constablesse of that place
 In all that lond no cristen durst route
All cristen folk ben fledde from þat contree
Thurgh payens that conquered all about
The plages of the North by lond and see
To Wales fledde the cristianite
Of old bretons dwellyng in this Ile
There was her refute for þe mene while
 But yitte nere cristen bretons so exiled
That there nere som  that in her preuetee
Honoured Crist  and hethen folk begiled
And nye the Castell  soch þer dwellen iij
That one of hem was blynd and myght nat see
But it were with thilk eyen of his mynd
With which men seen  whan that þey be blynd
 Bright was the son  as in that somers day
ffor which the constable and his wyf also
And Custaunce han take the right way
Toward the see  a furlong way or two
To playen and to romen to and fro
And in her walk this blynd man þey mette
Croked and old with eyen fast yshette
 IN name of crist kried this blynd bretoun
Dame Hermengild  yeve me my sight ageyn
This lady waxe affraied of þe soun
Lest that hir husbond  shortly for to seyn
Wold hir for Ihesu cristes loue haue sleyn
Till Custaunce made hir bold  and bad hir wirche
The will of Crist  as doughter of his chirche


 THe Constable wax abasshed of that sight  
And seid what amounteth all this fare
Custaunce answerd  sire it is Cristes myght
That helpeth folk  out of the fendes snare
And so ferforth  she gan our lay declare
That she the Constable  or that it was eve
Conuerteth  and on Crist maketh him byleve
 The Constable was no thyng lord of this place
Of which I speke  there as he Custaunce fonde
But kept it strongly many a wynters space
Vnder Alla kyng of all Northumberlond
That was full wys and worthy of his honde
Agayn þe Scottes as men may well here
But turne I woll ageyn to my matere
 Sathan that vs waiteth ever to begile
Saugh of Custaunce all her perfeccion
And cast anon how he myght quyte hir while
And made a yong knyght  that dwelt in the toun
Love hir so hote of foule affeccion
That verrely hym thought  he shold spill
But he of hir myght ones haue his will
 He woweth hir but it availeth nought
She wold do no synne by no wey
And for despit he compassed in his thought
To make hir on shames deth to deye
He waiteth whan the Constable was awey
And prively vpon a nyght he crepte
In Hermyngildes chambre while she slepte
 Wery forwaked in her orisons
Slepeth Custaunce and Hermyngild also
This knyght thurgh Sathanas temptacions
All softly is to the bed ygoo


And kutte the throte of Hermyngild atwo
And leid the blody knyf by Dame Custaunce
And went his wey  ther god yeve him meschaunce
 Sone after comth this constable home agayn
And eke Alla that kyng was of þat lond
And saugh his wyf dispitously slayn
ffor which full oft he wepe  and wrong his honde
And in the bedde  the blody knyf he fonde 
By Dame Custaunce  allas what myght he sey  
ffor verrey woo  his witte was all awey
 To kyng Alla was told all this myschaunce
And eke the tyme and where  and in what wise
That in ship was found this Custaunce
As ye han herebeforn herd devise
The kynges hert of pitee gan agrise
Whan he saugh  so benigne a creature
ffall in disese and mysauenture
 ffor as the lombe toward his deth is brought
So stant this Innocent byfore this kyng
This fals knyght that hath this treson wrought
Bereth hir on honde þat she hath don this thing
But natheles ther was grete morenyng
Among  the peple  and seyn þey can nat gesse
Þat she hade don so grete a wikkednesse
 ffor they han seen hir euere so vertuous
And lovyng Hermengild right as hir lyf
Of this bare witnes  euerycch in that hous
Saue he þat Hermengild slough with his knyf
This gentill kyng hath caught a grete motyf
Of thise witnes  and thought he wold enquere
Depper in this mater  a trowth for to bere


 Allas Custaunce þou hast no champion
Ne fight canst þou nought so wele a wey
But he þat starf for our redempcon
And bond Sathan and lyeth there he lay
So be thy strong Champion this day
ffor but Crist open myracle kythe
withouten gilt þou shalt be slayn as swythe 
 She sette hir doun on knees  and thus she seid
Inmortall god that savedest Susanne
ffrom fals blame  and þou mercifull meid
Marie I mene doughter to Seint Anne
Byfore whoos child Aungels syng Osanne
Yf I be giltles of this felonye
My socour be or elles shall I dye
 Haue ye nat seen somtyme a pale face
Among a prees  of hym þat hath be lad
Toward his deth where as hym gate no grace
And soch a colour in his face hath hade  
Men myght knowe his face  that was bestade
Among all the faces in that route
So stant Custaunce  and loketh hir about
 O queenes lyuyng in prosperitee
Duchesse  and ye ladies euerychone
Haueth som rewth of her aduersitee
An Emperous doughter stant all alone
She hath no wight to whom to make hir mone
O blode riall that stondeth in this drede
ffer ben thy frendes at thy grete nede
 This Alla kyng hath soch compassion
As gentle hert is fulfilled of pitee
That from his eyen ran þe water doun
Now hastely do fecche a boke koth he


And yf this knyght woll swere how þat she
This womman slough yitte woll we vs avise
Whom that we woll that shall be our Iustise
 A breton boke writen with Ewangeles
was fette  and on this boke he sware anon
She gilty was  and in the mene whiles
An hand hym smote  vpon the nek boon
That doun he fell at ones as a stoon
And both his yen brast out of his face
In sight of euery body in that place
 A voys was herd in generall audience
And seid þou hast disclaundred giltlees
The doughter of holy chirch in high presence
Thus haast þou doon  and yitte hold I my pece
Of this mervaill agast was all the prece
As mased folk þey stoden euerychone
ffor drede of wreche saue Custaunce allone
 Grete was the drede  and eke þe repentaunce
Of hem that haden wrong suspescion
Vpon this sely Innocent Custaunce
And for this mater in conclusion
And by Custaunce mediacion
The kyng and many another in þat place
Conuerte was thanked be Cristes grace
 This fals knyght was slayn for his vntreuth
By Iugement of Alla hastely  
And yitte Custaunce hade of his deth grete reuth
And after this Ihesu of his mercy
Made Alla wedden full solempnely
This holy maiden  that is so bright and shene
And thus hath crist ymade Custaunce a quene


 But who was woofull yf I shall nat lye
Of this weddyng but Donegild and no moo
The kynges moder full of tyrannye
Hir thought hir cursed hert brast atwo
She wold nat hir son hade doon so
Hir thought a despit  that he shold take
So straunge a creatue  vn tohis make
 Me list nat of the chaffe ne of the stree
Maken so long a tale as of the corn
What shold I tell of þe rialtee
At the mariage  or which cours goth byforn
Who bloweth in a trump or in an horn
The fruyt of euery tale is for to sey
They ete  drank  daunce syng and pley
 They goon to bed  as it was skill and right
ffor though þat wyfes ben full holy thynges
They most take in pacience at nyght
Swiche maner necessaries  as ben plesynges
To folk  that han Iwedded hem  with rynges
And ley a lite  here holynesse asyde
As for the tyme  it may no bet betide
 On hire he gat  a knaue child anoone
And to a Busshop  and his Constable eke
he tok his wyf to kepe  whan he is gone
To Scotlondward  his foomen for to seke
Now fair Custaunce  þat is so humble and meke
So longe is goon with childe  to that stille
She halt hire chaumbre  abidynge cristes wylle
 The tyme is come  a knaue child she beer
Mauricius at the fontstone  they him calle
This Constable  doth forth come  a messanger
And wroot vnto his kynge  þat cleped was Alle


how that this blisful tidynge  is byfalle
And othere tidyngges  spedeful for to seye
he hath the lettre  and forth he goth his weye
 This messanger  to doon hise auauntage
Vnto the kynges moder  rideth swithe
And salueth hire faire  in his langage
Madame quod he  ȝe may be glad and blithe
And thanketh god  an hundred thouȝsand sithe
My lady Queene hath child  withoute doute
To ioye and blisse  to al this regne aboute
 lo heere the lettres  seeled of this thynge
That I moot beere  with al the hast I may
If ȝe wol aught  vnto ȝoure sone the kynge
I am ȝoure seruaunt  bothe nyght and day
Donegilde answered  as now at this tyme  nay
But heere al nyght  I wol thow take thy reest
Tomorwe wol I sey thee  what me leest
 This messanger drank sadly  Ale and wyne
And stolen were hise lettres  preuyly
Out of his box  while he slepe  as a swyne
And countrefeted was  ful subtilly
Another lettre  wrought ful synfully
Vnto the kynge  directe of this mateer
ffro his Constable  as ȝe shuln after heer
 The lettre spak  the Queene delyuered was
Of so horrible  a feendliche creature
That in the Castel  noon so hardy was
That any while  durst there endure
The moder was an Elf  be auenture
Icomen be charmes  or by sorcerie
And euerich man hateth  hire companye  

 Woo was this kyng  whan he this lettre had sayn
But to no wyght he tolde  hise sorwes soore
But of his owen hond  he wroot agayn
Welcome the sonde of Crist  for euere more
To me that am now  lerned in his loore
lord welcome be thy lust  and thy plesaunce
My lust I putte  al in thyn ordinaunce
 Kepeth this child  al be it foul or feyre
And eke my wyf  vnto myn hoom comynge
Crist whan him list  may sende me an Eyr
Moore agreable  than this  to my likynge
This lettre he seeleth  pryuely wepynge
Which to the messanger  was take soone
And forth he goth  there is no more to done
 O Messanger fulfilled  of drunkenesse
Stronge is thy breeth  thy lymes faltren ay
And thow bywreyest  alle secrenesse
Thy mind is lorn  þou ianglest as a Iay
Thy face is turned  in a newe aray
There dronkenesse regneth  in any route
There is no counseil hid  withouten doute
 O Donegild  I ne haue  noon englissh digne
vnto thy malice  and thy tyrannye
And þerfore to the feild  I the resigne
lat hym endyten  of thy traytorie
ffy mannyssh fy  o nay be god I lye
ffy feendly spirit  for I dar wel telle
Though þou heere walk  thy spirit is in helle
 This messanger cometh  fro the kyng agayn
And at the kynges modres court  he light
And she was of this messanger  ful fayn
And pleesed him  in al that euere she myght


he drank  and wel his girdel vnderpight
he slepeth and he snorteth  in his gyse
Al nyght  to the sonne gan aryse
 Eft weere hise lettres  stolen euerychone
And countrefeted lettres  in thys wyse
The kyng comaundeth  his Constable anoon
vp peyne of hangynge  and on hey Iuyse
That he ne shulde suffren  in no wyse
Custaunce withInne his regne  for to abide
Three dayes  and o quarter of a tyde
 But in the same ship  as he hire fonde
hire and hire ȝonge sone  and al hire gere
He shulde putte  and croude hire fro the londe  
And charge hire  she neuere eft come there
O my Custaunce  wel may thy goost haue feere
And slepynge in thy dreem  ben in penaunce
Whan Donegild cast  al this ordinaunce
 This Messanger on morwe  whan he woke
vnto the Castel  al the next way
And to the Constable  he the lettre tooke
And whan that he  this pytous lettre say
fful ofte he seide allas  and weilawey
lord Crist quod he  how may this world endure
So ful of synne  is many a creature
 O myghty god  if that it be thy wylle
Sithe þou art rightful Iuge  how may it be
That þow wolt suffren  Innocenteȝ to spille
And wykked folk regnen  in prosperitee
O goode Custaunce  allas so woo is me
That I mot be thy turmentour  or deye
On shames deeth  there is noon other weye


 Wepen bothe ȝonge and olde  in al that place
Whan that the kynge  this cursed lettre sente
And Custaunce  with a deedly pale face
The fierthe day  toward hire ship she went
But nathelees  she taketh in good entent
The wyl of Crist  and kneled on the stronde
She seide lord  ay welcome be thy sonde
 He that me kepte  fro the fals blame
Whyl I was on the lond  amonges ȝow
he can me kepe  fro harme and eke fro shame
In salt see  although I se nought how
As stronge as euere he was  he is ȝet now
In him troost I  and in his moder deere
That is to me my seyl  and eke my steere
 hire litel child  lay wepyng in hire arme
And knelynge pytously  to him she seyde
Pees litel sone  I wol do the noon harme
With þat hire couerchief  ouer hire hede she brayde
And ouer his litel eyen  she it leyde
And in hire arm  she lulleth it ful fast
And into heuene  hire eyen vp she cast
 Moder quod she  and mayde bright Marie
Soth is  that thurgh wommannes eggement
Mankynde was lorn  and dampned ay to deye
ffor whiche thy child  was on þe croys Irent
Thy blisseful eyen  saw al this turmont  
Thanne is there  no comparisone bytwene
Thy woo  and any woo  man may sustene
 Thow saw thy child Islayn  biforn thyne eyen
And ȝet now lyueth  my litel child parfay
Now lady bright  to whom alle wooful cryen
Thow glorie of wommanhode  þou faire may


Thow hauene of refuyt  bright sterre of day
Rewe on my childe  that of thy gentillesce
Rewest on euery reuful  in distresse
 O litel child  allas what is thy gilt
That neuere wroughtest synne  as ȝet pardee
Why wyl thyn fader  han the spilt
O mercy deere Constable  quod she
As lat my litel child  dwelle heere with the
And if þou darst nouȝt  sauen him fro blame
So kisse him oones  in his fadres name
 Therewith she loked bakward  to the londe
And seide farewel husbonde  routhelees
And vp she rist  and walketh doun the stronde
Toward the ship  hire folweth al the prees
And euere she preyeth  hire child  to hold his pees
And takith hire leue  and with an hol entent
She blissed hire  and into shipe she went
 Vetailled was the ship  it is no drede
habundauntly  for hire  ful longe space
And othere necessaries  that shulde nede
She had Inow  heried be goddes grace
ffor wynd and weder  almyghty god purchace
And brynge hire home  I kan no betyr seye
But in the See  she dryueth forth hire weye
Alla the kyng  cometh hom sone after this
vnto his Castel  of the whiche I tolde
And asketh where his wyf  and his child is
The Constable gan  aboute his hert colde


And pleynly al the maner  he him tolde
As ȝe han herd  I kan telle it no bettre
And sheweth the kyng  his seel and his lettre
 And seide  lord  as ȝe comaunded me
vp peyne of deeth  so haue I doon certeyne
This Messanger turmented was  til he
Most byknowe  and tellen plat and pleyn
ffro nyght to nyght  in what place he had leyn
And thus by wytte  and subtil enquerynge  
Imagyned was  by whom this harm gan sprynge
 The hond was knowe  that the lettre wroot
And al the venym  of this cursed dede
But in what wyse  certeynly I not
The effect is this  that Alla oute of dreede
his moder slough  that moun men pleynly reede
ffor that she traytour was  to hire ligeaunce
Thus endith Donegild  with myschaunce
 The sorwe that this Alla  nyght and day
Maketh for his wyf  and for his child also
There is no tonge  that it telle may
But now wol I  vnto Custaunce go
That fleteth in the See  in peyne and woo
ffyue ȝer and more  as lyked cristes sonde
That hire ship approched  vnto the londe
 vnder an hethen Castel  at the last
Of which the name  in my text  nouȝt I fynde
Custaunce and eke hire child  the see vp cast
Almyghty god  that saued al mankynde
haue oon Custaunce  and on hire child sum mynde
That fallen is  in hethen hand eftsone
In poynt to spille  as I shal telle ȝow sone


 Doun fro the Castel  cometh there many a wyght
To gauren on this ship  and on Custaunce
But shortly from the Castel  on a nyght
The lordes styward  god ȝeue him myschaunce
A theef þat had reneyed  oure creaunce
Come into the ship allone  and seid he shulde
hire lemman be  wheiþer so she wolde or nolde
 Woo was this wrecched womman  thoo bygon
hire child cryed  and she cryed pitously
But blisful Mary halp  hire right anoon
ffor with here strogelyng  wel and myghtily
The thef fel ouer bord  al sodeynly
And in the See he dreynt  for vengeaunce
And thus hath Crist  vnwemmed kept Custaunce
 O foule lust of luxurie  lo thyn ende
Nat oonly that þou feyntest  mannes mynde
But verraily thow wold  his body shende
The ende of thy werk  or of thy lustes blynde
Is compleynynge  how many oon  may men fynde
That nought for werk  sumtyme but for the entent
To doon this synne  ben outher slayn or shent
   How may this weyke womman  han this strengthe
hire to defende  ageyn this renegat
O Golias  vnmesurable of lengthe
How myght Dauyd  make the so mat
So ȝonge  and of armure so desolat
How durst he loke  vpon thy dreedful face
Wel may men seen  it was but goddes grace
 Who ȝaf Iudith  corage or hardynesse
To slen him Olyfern  in his tent
And to delyueren out  of wrechednesse
The peeple of god  I sey for this entent


That right as god  spirit  of vigour sent
To hem  and saued hem  out of meschaunce
So sent he myght and vigour  to Custaunce
 fforth goth hir ship  thurghout the narugh mouth
Of Iubaltare and Septe  dryuyng alway
Sumtyme west  and sumtyme North and South
And sumtyme Est  ful many a wery day
Til Cristes moder  blessed be she ay
hath shapen thurgh  hire endlees goodnesse
To make an ende  of al hire heuynesse
 Now lat vs stynt  of Custaunce but a throwe
And speke of the Romayn  Emperour
That out of Surrye  hath by lettres knowe
The slaughtre of Cristene folk  and dishonour
Doon to his doughter  by a fals traytour
I mene the cursed wykked  Soudanesse
That at the feest  let sleen bothe moore and lesse
 ffor which this Emperour  hath sent anoon
his senatour  with roial ordinaunce
And othere lordes  god woot many oon
On Surryens  to taken heigh vengeaunce
They brennen  sleen  and brynge hem to meschaunce
fful many a day  but shortly this is the ende
homward to Rome  they shepen hem to wende
 This senatour  repaireth with victorie
To Romeward  seillynge ful roially
And mette the ship dryuyng  as seith the storie
In which Custaunce sitteth  ful pytously
No thyng knew he  what she was  ne why
She was in swich aray  ne she nyl sey
Of hire estate  though she shulde dey


 He bryngeth hire to Rome  and to his wyf
he ȝaf hire  and hire ȝonge sone also
And with the senatour  she lad hire lif
Thus can oure lady  bryngen out of woo  
Wooful Custaunce  and many another moo
And longe tyme dwelled she  in that place
In holy werkes euere  as was hire grace
 The senatours wyf  hire Aunte was
But for al that  she knew hire neuere the moore
I wyl no lengere tary  in this caas
But to the kyng Alla  which I spak of ȝore
That wepeth for his wyf  and sygheth sore
I wyl returne  and lete I wyl Custaunce
vnder the Senatours  gouernaunce
 Kyng Alla  which  þat hath  his moder slayn
vpon a day fel  in swich repentaunce
That if I shortly tellen shal  and pleyn
To Rome he cometh  to resceyue his penaunce
And putte him  in the Popes ordinaunce
In heigh and low  and ihesu crist bysought
fforȝeue hise wykked werkes  that he wrought
 The fame anoon  thurghout the toun is born
how Alla kyng  shal come on pilgrymage
By herbegours  that wenten him byforn
ffor which the Senatour  as it was vsage
Rood him aȝein  and many of his lynage
As wel to shewen  his heigh magnificence
As to doon  any kyng  a reuerence
 Gret cher maketh  this noble Senatour
To kyng Alla  and he to hym also
Eueryche of hem  doth other gret honour
And so byfell  that withinne a day or twoo


This Senatour is  to kyng Alla goo
To feeste  and shortly  if I shal nat lye
Custaunces sone  went in his companye
 Somme men wold seyn  that at the request of Custaunce
This senatour hath lad  this child to feste
I may nat tellen  euery circumstaunce
Be as be may  there was he at the leste
But soth is  that  at his modres heeste
Byforn Alla  duryng the metes space
The child stood  lokyng in the kynges face
 This Alla kyng  hath of the child greet wonder
And to the Senatour  he seide anoon
Whoos is this fair child  that stondeth ȝonder
I not quod he  by god  and by seynt Iohn
A moder he hath  but fader hath he noon  
That I of woot  but shortly in a stounde
he told Alla  how that child was founde
 But god woot  quod this senatour also
So vertuous a lyuere  in al my lyf
Ne saw I neuere  as she  ne herd of moo
Of worldly wommen  mayden ne of wyf
I dar wel seyn  hire had leuere a knyf
Thurghout hire breest  than be a womman wykke
There is no man  coude bryng hire to that prykke
 Now was this child  as lyke vnto Custaunce
As possible is  a creature for to be
This Alla hath the face  in remembraunce
Of Dame Custaunce  and theroon mused he
If that the childes moder  were ought she
That is his wyf  and preuyly he sight
And sped him fro the table  that he myght


 Parfoy thought he  fantom is in myn heede
I ought deme  of skylful Iugement
That in the salt See  my wife is dede
And afterward he mad  his argument
What woot I  if that Crist haue hidder sent
My wyf by See  as wel as he hire lent
To my contree  from thens that she went
 And after noon  hom with the senatour
Gooth Alla  for to seen this wonder chaunce
This Senatour doth Alla  greet honour
And hastily he sent  after Custaunce
But trosteth wel  hire list nat to daunce
Whan þat she wyst  wherfore  was that sond
vnethe vpoon hire feet  she myght stond
 Whan Alla saugh his wyf  faire he hire grette
And wepte  þat it was  reuthe for to se
ffor at the first looke  he on hire sette
he knew wel weraily  that it was she
And she for sorwe  as dombe stant  as tree
So was hire hert shette  in hir distresse
Whan she remembred  his vnkyndenesse
 Twyes she swoughned  in his owen sight
he wepeth  and him excuseth pitously
Now god quod he  and his halwes bright
So wysly oon my soule  as haue mercy
That of ȝoure harm  as giltlees am I
As is Maurice my sone  like ȝoure face
Elles the fend  me fecche out of this place
 Longe was the sobbyng  and the bittere peyne  
Er that here wooful hertes  myghten sese
Greet was the pitee  for to heere hem pleyn
Thurgh which pleyntes  gan here woo encrese


I prey ȝow Alla  my labour to relese
I may not telle my woo  vntil tomorwe
I am so wery  for to speke of sorwe
 But finally  whan the sothe is wist
That Alla  giltlees was  of hire woo
I trowe an  C  tymes  ben they kist
And swich a blisse is there  betwix hem two
That saue the ioye  that lasteth euere moo
There is noon lyke  that any creature
Hath seen  or shal  while the world may endure
 Tho preyede she hire housbonde  mekely
In releef  of hire longe  pytous peyn
That he wold prey hire fader  specialy
That of his mageste  he wold enclyn
To vouchesaf  som day  with him to dyne
She preyed him eke  he wold by no wey
vnto hire fader  no word of hire sey
 Somme men wold seyn  how that the child Maurice
Dooth this message  vnto this Emperour
But as I gesse  Alla was nouȝt so nyce
To hym that was  of so soleyn honour
As he that is  of Cristene folk the flour
Sent ony child  but it is bete to deme
He went him self  and so it may wel seme
 This Emperour  hath graunted  gentilly
To come to dyner  as he him bysought
And wel reede I  he loked besily
vpon this child  and on his doughter þought
Alla gooth to his Inne  and as him ought
Arrayed for this feeste  in euery wyse
As ferforth  as his conyng may suffise


 The morwe cam  and Alla gan him dresse
And eke his wyf  this Emperour to mete
And forth they ryde  in ioye and in gladnesse
And whan she saw  hire fader in the strete
She light doun  and fallith him to fete
ffader quod she  ȝoure ȝong child Custaunce
Is now ful clene  out of ȝoure remembraunce
 I am ȝoure doughter  Custaunce  quod she
That whilom  ȝe han sent  into Surrye  
It am I fader  that in the salt See
Was put allone  and dampned for to deye
Now good fader  mercy I ȝow crye
Send me nomore  vnto noon hethenes
But thanketh my lord  heere  of his kyndnes
 Who can the pytous  ioye  tellen alle
Betwixe hem three  syn they be thus Imette
But of my tale  make an ende I shalle
The day gooth fast  I wyl no lengere lette
This glad folk  to dyner they hem sette
In ioye and blisse  at mete I lete hem dwelle
A  Ml  fold  moore than I can telle
 This child Maurice  was sithen Emperour
Mad by the Pope  and lyued cristenly
To cristes chirche  he dide gret honour
But I lete al  this story passen by
Of Custaunce is my tale  specialy
In the olde Romayne gestes  moun men fynde
Maurices lyf  I bere it nat in mynde
 The kyng Alla  whan he his tyme sey
With his Custaunce  his holy wyf so swete
To Englond ben they come  the right wey
Wheere as they lyue  in ioye and in quiete


But litel while it lasteth  I ȝow hete
Ioye of this world  for tyme wol nat abyde
ffro day to nyght  it chaungeth as the tyde
 Who leued euere  in swich delyt  oo  day
That him ne meeued  other conscience
Or ire  or talent  or som maner affray
Enuye  or pryde  or passion  or offence
I ne seye  but for this ende  this sentence
That litel while  in ioye or in plesaunce
lasteth the blisse  of Alla  with Custaunce
 ffor deth that taketh  of hey and lowe his rente
Whan passed was a ȝere  euene as I gesse
Out of this world  this kyng Alla he hente
ffor whom Custaunce  hath ful gret heuynesse
Now lat vs preye to god  his soule blisse
And Dame Custaunce  fynaly to seye
Toward the toun of Rome  gooth hire weye
 To Rome is come  this holy creature
And fyndeth hire frendes  hole and sounde
Now is she skaped  al hire auenture
And whan that she  her fader  hath Ifounde  
Doun on hire knees  falleth she to grounde
Wepynge for tendirnesse  in hert blithe
She herieth god  an hundred thousand sithe
 In vertue and holy  almes dede
They lyuen alle  and neuere asonder wende
Til deeth departeth hem  this lif they lede
And fareth now wel  my tale is at an ende
Now ihesu crist  that of his myght may sende
Ioye after woo  gouerne vs  in his grace
And kepe vs alle  that ben in this place
Experience  though noon auctoritee
Were in this world  is right Inow for me
To speken of woo  that is in mariage
ffor lordynges  syn I twelue ȝer was of age
Thanked be god  that is eterne on lyue
husbondes at the chirche doore  haue I had fyue
If I so often myght  han wedded be
And alle weren worthy men  in here degree
But me was told  nought longe agon is
That sithen Crist  ne went neuere but oonys
To weddyng  in the Cane of Galilee
That by the same ensaumple  taught he me
That I ne wedded  shuld be but ones
loo herkene which  a sharp word  for the nones
Beside a welle  ihesus god and man
Spak in repreue  of the Samaritan
Thow hast Ihad  fyue husbondes quod he
And that ilke man  which that now hath the
Is nat thyn husbonde  thus seide he certeyn
What that he ment therby  I can nought seyn
But that I aske why  that the fifte man
Was noon husbonde  to the Samaritan
how many myght she haue  in mariage
Ȝet herd I neuere  tellen in myn age


vpon this noumbre  diffinicion
Men may deuyne  and glosen vp and doun
But wel I woot  expresse  withouten lye
God bad vs for to wexe  and multiplie
That gentil text  can I wel vnderstonde  
Eke wel I woot he seide  þat myn husbonde
Shuld leete fader and moder  and take to me
But of no noumbre  mencione mad he
Of Bygamye  or of Octogamye
Why shulde men thanne  speke of it velanye
loo heere the wyse kyng  Salamon
I trowe he hadde  wyues moo than oon
As wolde god  it leueful were to me
To be refresshed  half so ofte as he
Which a ȝift of god  had he for alle his wyues
No man hath swich  þat now on lyue is
God wot this noble kyng  as to my wytte
The first nyght  had many a mery fitte
With ech of hem  so wel was him on lyue
Blessed be god  that I haue wedded fyue
Of whiche  I haue pyked out the beste
Bothe of here nether purs  and of here cheste
Diuerse scoles  maken parfyt clerkes
And diuerse practyk in many sondry werkes
Maken  the werkman parfyt  sekirly
Of fyue husbondes scoleiyng  am I
Welcome the sixte  whan þat euere he shal
ffor syn I wol nat kepe me  chast in al
Whan myn husbonde  is fro the world goon
Sum cristene man  shal wedde me anoon
ffor thanne the Apostle  seith þat I am free
To wedde a goddes halue  where it liketh me
he seith  that to be wedded  is no synne
Bet is to be wedded  than brynne
What rekketh me  though folk sey vylenye
Of shrewed lameth  and his bygamye
I woot wel Abraham  was an holy man
And Iacob eke  as fer as euer y can
And ich of hem had wyues  moo than twoo
And many another  holy man also
Wheere can ye seen  in any maner age
That heye god defended  mariage


By expresse word  I prey ȝow telleth me
Or where comaunded he  virginite
I woot as wel as ȝe  it is no drede
The Appostel whan he speketh  of maydenhede
he seide that precept  had he therof noon
Men moun counseile  a womman to ben oon
But counseillynge  is no comaundement
He putte it  in oure owen Iugement   
ffor had god comaunded  maydenheede
Than had he dampned  weddyng with the dede
And certes if there were  no seede Isowe
virginite than  wherof shuld it growe
Poule durst nat comaunden  at the leste
A thyng of which  his maister ȝaf noon heeste
The dart is sette vp  for virginitee
Cacche who so may  who renneth best lat se
But this word is nat take  of euery wyght
But there as god wol ȝeue it  of his myght
I wot wel that the Appostel  was a mayde
But nathelees  though that he wroot or sayde
he wolde þat euery wyght  were swich as he
Al nys but counseille  to virginitee
And for to be a wyf  he ȝaf me leeue
Of indulgence  so is noon repreeue
To wedde me  if that my make deye
With·oute excepcione  of bygamye
Al were it good  no womman for to touche
he ment in his bed  or in his couche
ffor peril is  bothe tow and fyr  to assemble
Ȝe knowe what this ensaumple  may resemble
This is al and sum  he held virginitee
More parfyt  than weddynge in freeletee
ffreeltee clepe I  but if that he and she
Wold here lyues lede  al in chastitee
I graunte it wel  I haue noon envye
Though maydenhede  preferre bygamye


It liketh hem to be clene  in body and goost
Of myn estat  I wol nat maken boost
ffor wel ȝe knowe  a lord in his houshold
Ne hath nat euery vessel  al of gold
Summe ben of tree  and don here lord seruyse
God clepeth folk  to hym in sundry wyse
And euerich hath of god  a propre ȝifte
Som this  som that  as þat him liketh shifte
virginite is  a gret perfeccion
And continence eke  with deuocion
But crist  that of perfeccion  is welle
Ne bad nat euery wyght  he shuld selle
Al þat he had  and ȝeue it to the poore
And in swich wyse  folwe him and his foore
he spak to hem  that wold leue parfitly
And lordynges be ȝoure leeue  that am not I
I wol bestowe  the flour of al myn age  
In the actes  and in the fruyt of mariage
Telle me also  in what conclusione
Were membres made  of generacione
And of so parfyt wyse  a wyght Iwrought
Trosteth right wel  they were nat made for nought
Glose who so wele  and sey bothe vp and doun
That they weren Imade  for purgacione
Of vryne  and oure bothe thynges smale
Weren eke to knowe  a femele fro a male
And for noon other cause  sey ȝe noo
The experience wot wel  it is nat so
So that the Clerkes  be nat with me wroth
I seye this  that they maked be  for bothe
This is to seyn  bothe for office and for ease
Of engendure  there we nat god displeese
Why shulde men ellis  in here bookes sette
That men shal ȝelde  to his wyf hire dette
Now wherwith shuld he make  his paiement
If that he ne vsed  his seely Instrument


Than were they made  vpoon a creature
To purge vryne  and eke for engendrure
But I sey nought  that euery wyght is holde
That hath swich harneys  as I to ȝow tolde
To gon and vsen hem  in engendrure
Than shulde men take  of chastitee no cure
Crist was a mayde  and shapen as a man
And many a Seynt  sithe þat the world bygan
Ȝet lyued they euere  in parfyt chastitee
I nyl envye  no virginitee
Lat hem be breed  of pured whete seede
And lat vs wyues  hote barly breede
And ȝet with barly breed  Mark telle can
Oure lord ihesu  refresshed many a man
In swich estat  as god hath cleped vs
I wol perseuere  I nam nat precious
In wyfhode wyl I vse  myn Instrument
As freely as my makere  hath it sent
If I be daungerous  god ȝeue me sorwe
Myn husbonde shal it haue  bothe eue and morwe
Whan that him liste  come forth and paie his dette
An husbonde wol I haue  I wol nat lette
Which shal be bothe  my dettour and my thral
And haue his tribulacion  withal
Vpon his fleessh  while that I am his wyf  
I haue the power  duryng al my lyf
vpon his propre body  and nat he
Right thus the Apostel  told it vnto me
And bad oure husbondes  for to loue vs wele
Al this sentence  me liketh euerydele
  vp sterte the Pardoner  and that anoon
Now dame quod he  by god and by Seynt Iohn
Ȝe ben a noble prechour  in this caas
I was aboute to wedde a wyf  Allas
What shulde I bye it  on my flessh so deere
Ȝet had I leuere  wedde noon to ȝere


Abyde quod she  my tale is nat bygonne
Nay þou shalt drynken  of another tonne
Er that I go  shal sauer wers than Ale
Whan that I haue told the  forth my tale
Of tribulacione  that is in mariage
Of which I am expert  in al myn age
This is to seyn  my self hath ben the whippe
Than maist þou chese  whider þat thow wylt sippe
Of thilk Tonne  that I wyl abroche
By war of it  or þou to ny approche
ffor I shal telle ensaumples  moo than ten
Who so that nyl  be war  by othere men
By him shuln othere men  corrected be
Theise same wordes  wryteth Protholomee
Rede in his Almagest  and take it there
Dame I wold preye ȝow  if ȝoure wyl were
Seide this Pardoner  as ȝe bygan
Telleth forth ȝoure tale  and spareth for no man
And techeth vs ȝonge men  of ȝoure practike
Gladly quod she  syn that it may ȝow lyke
But that I praye  to alle this companye
If that I speke  after my fantasye
As taketh it nought a gref  of that I seye
ffor myn entent is nat  but for to pleye
Now Sires than shal I  tellen ȝow forth my tale
As euere mot I  drynken wyn or Ale
I shal seye soth  the husbondes that I had
As thre of hem weren goode  and twoo weren bad
The thre of hem weren goode  and riche and olde
Vnethe myghten they  the statut holde
In which that they were bounden  vnto me
Ȝe wot wel what I mene  of this pardee
As god helpe me  I laughe whan that I thynke  
how pitously a nyght  I made hem swynke
But be my fey  I tolde of it no store
They had me ȝeuen  here lond and here tresore


Me neded nat  do lengere diligence
To wynne here loue  or do hem reuerence
They loued me so wel  by god aboue
That I ne told  no deynte of here loue
A wys womman  wyl besy hire euere in oon
To geten hire loue  there as she hath noon
But syn I had hem  holly in myn hand
And syn that they  had ȝeue me al here land
what shulde I take kepe  hem for to pleese
But if it were for my profyt  and myn eese
I sette hem so a werk  be my fey
That many a nyght  they songen weylawey
The bacon was nat fet  for hem as I trowe
That summe men han in Essex  at Donmowe
I gouerned hem so wel  after my lawe
That iche of hem  ful blisful was and fawe
To brynge me gay thynges  fro the feyre
They were ful glad  when I spak to hem fayre
ffor god it woot  I chidde hem spitously
Now herkeneth how  I bar me proprely
Ȝe wyse wyues  that can vnderstonde
Thus shuld ȝe speke  and bere hem wrong on honde
ffor half so boldly  there can no man
Sweren and lyen  as a womman can
I sey nat this  be wyues that ben wyse
But if it be  whan they hem mys avyse
A wys wyf shal  if that she can hire good
Bere him on honde  that the kow is wood
And take wytnesse  of hire owen mayde
Of hire assent  but herkeneth how I sayde
Sire olde kaynard  is this thyn array
why is my neyghebores wyf  so gay
She is honoured  ouer alle there she goth
I sitte at hom  I haue no thrifty cloth
what dost thow  at my neyhebores hous
Is she so fair  art thow so amerous


what rovne ȝe with oure mayden  benedicite
Sire olde lecchour  late thyne iapes be
d if that I haue  a gosship or a freende
houten gilt  ȝe chiden as a fende
If that I walke or rome  vnto hir hous  
Thow comest hom  as dronken as a Mous
And prechest on thy benche  with euele preef
Thow seist to me  it is a gret myschief
To wedde a poore womman  for costage
And if that she be riche  of heigh parage
Than seist thow  that it is a turmentrie
To suffre hire pride  and hire malacolie
And if that she be fair  thow verray knaue
Thow seist that euery holour  wol hire haue
She may no while  in chastite abyde
That is assayled  vpon eche a syde
Thow seist somme folk  desiren vs for richesse
Somme for oure shap  and somme for oure fairnesse
And sum for she can  either synge or daunce
And sum for gentilnesse  and daliaunce
Sum for hire hondes  and hire armes smale
Thus goth al to the deuele  by thy tale
Thow seist men moun nat kepe  a castel wal
It may so longe  assailed ben  ouer al
And if that she be foul  thow seist that she
Coueyteth euery man  that she may se
ffor as a spaynel  she wol on him lepe
Til that she fynde sum man  hire to chepe
Ne noon so grey goos  goth there in the lake
As seist þou  wyl be withouten a make
And seist it is  an hard thyng for to welde
A thyng þat no man wyl  his thankes helde
Thus seist þou lorel  whan thow gost to bedde
And that no wyse man  nedeth for to wedde
Ne no man that entendeth  vnto heuen
with wylde thundir dynt  and firy leuen


Mote thy welked nekke  be tobroke
Thow seist that droppyng houses  and eke smoke
And chidyng wyues  maken men to flee
Out of hire owen houses  a benedicite
what eilith swich an olde man  to chide
Thow seist we wyues  wyln oure vices hide
Til we be fast  and thanne we wol hem shewe
wel may this be  a prouerbe of a shrewe
Thow seist that Oxen  Assen  Hors and houndes
They ben assayed  at diuerse stoundes
Basyns  lauours  or that men hem bye
Spones stoles  and al swiche husbondrye  
And so ben pottes  clothes and array
But men of wommen  maken noon assay
Til they ben wedded  olde doted shrewe
And thanne seist þou  we wol oure vices shewe
Thow seist also  that it displeseth me
But if þat þou wylt preyse  my beaute
And but thow poure  alwey vpon my face
And clepe me fair dame  in euery place
And but thow make a feest  on thilke day
That I was born  and make me fressh and gay
And but thow do  to my norice honour
And to my chaumberer  withInne my boure
And to my fadres folk  and hise allies
Thus seist þou olde barel  ful of lyes
And ȝet of oure Apprentys  Iankyn
ffor his crispe heer shynynge  as gold fyn
And for he squyereth me  vp and doun
Ȝet hast þou caught  a fals suspecion
I wol him nought  though þou were ded tomorwe
But telle me þis  why  hidest thow with sorwe
The keyes of thy chest  awey fro me
It is my good  as wel as thyn  parde
what wenest thow  to make an Idiote of oure dame
Now by that lord  that cleped is Seynt Iame


Thow shalt nat bothe  though þat þou were wood
Be maistre of my body  and of my good
That oon þou shalt forgon  maugre thyne eyen

Thow shuldest seye good wyf  go where the liste
Taketh ȝoure disport  I wol nat leue no tales

Of alle men  Iblessed mot he be

Of alle men  his wysdom is heyest
That rekketh nat  who hath the world in honde
By this prouerbe  þou shalt vnderstonde

A man to light a candele  at his lanterne

Thow seist also  if that we make vs gay
with clothynge  or with precious array
That it is perile  of oure chastitee
And ȝet with sorwe  þou must enforce the
And seyn theise wordes  in the Aposteles name
In habyt mad  with chastite and shame
Ȝe wommen  shulde apparaille ȝow quod he
And nat in tressed heer  and riche perre
Ns peerles ne gold  ne clothes riche
After thy text  ne after thy rubriche
I wol nat werche  as meche as doth a gnat
Thow seist als  I walke out lyke a kat


ffor who so wolde senge  the Cattes skyn
Than wold the kat  dwellen in his In
And if the kattes skyn  be slyke and gay
She wol nat dwelle  in house half a day
But forth she wol  or any day be dawed
To shewe hire skyn  and go on Caterwawed
This is to seyn  if I be gay sire shrewe
I wol renne out  my borel for to shewe
Sire olde foole  what helpeth the to aspyen
Though thow preye Argus  with his hundred eyen
To be my wardecors  as he can best
In feith he shal nat kepe me  but me list
Ȝet coude I make his berd  also mote I thee
Thow seidest eke  þat there ben thynges three
The whiche thynges  troublen al this erthe
And that no wyght  may endure the ferthe
O leue sire shrewe  Ihesus short thy lyf
Ȝet precest þou and seist  an hateful wyf
Irekened is  for oon of theise meschaunces
Beth there noone othere  resemblaunces
That ȝe may likne  ȝoure Parables to
But if a seely wyf  be on of thoo
Thow likenest eke  wommanes loue to helle
To bareyn lond  there water may nat dwelle
Thow likenest it also  to wylde fyre
The more it brenneth  the more it hath desire
To consume euery thyng  that wol brent be
Thow seist right as wormes  shenden a tree  
Right so a wyf  destroyeth hire husbonde
This knowen they  that ben to wyues bonde
Lordynges  right thus  as ȝe han vnderstonde
Bar I stifly  myn olde husbondes on honde
That thus they seiden  in here dronkenesse
And al was fals  but that I tok wytnesse
On Iankyn  and on my nece also
O lord the peyne  I did hem and the woo


fful giltlees  by goddes swete pyne
ffor as an hors  I coude byte and whyne
I coude pleyne  and I was in the gilt
Or elles often tyme  I had ben spilt
who so that first cometh to the Mylle  first he grynt
I pleyned first  so was oure werre Istynt
They weren ful glad  to excuse hem ful blife
Of thyng  of whiche  they gilten neuere in here lyue
Of wenches  wold I beren hem on honde
whan that for seke  they myght vnethes stonde
Ȝet tikeled I his hert  for that he
wende  that I of him had  so gret chierte
I swor that al my walkyng  out be nyght
was for to aspien  wenches that he dight
vnder that colour  had I many a myrthe
ffor al swich wyt  is ȝeuen vs in oure birthe
Disceite  wepyng  spynnyng  god hath ȝeuen
To womman kyndely  while that they moun lyuen
And thus of on thyng  I auaunt me
At the ende  I had the beter  in ich degree
Be sleight or force  or sum maner thyng
As by contenuel murmur  and grucchyng
Namely a bedde  there had they myschaunce
There wold I chide  and do hem no plesaunce
I wold no lengere  in the bed abyde
If that I felt  his arme al ouer my syde
Til that he had mad  his raunson vnto me
Than wold I suffren him  to doon his nycete
And þerfore to euery man  this tale I telle
Wynne who so may  for all is for to selle
with empty hond  men moun noone haukes lure
ffor wynnynge wold I  al his lust endure
And make me  a feyned appetit
And ȝet in bacoun  had I neuere delit
That made me  þat euere I wold hem chide
ffor though the pope  had siten hem beside  

I wold nat spare hem  at here owen bord
ffor be my trouthe  I quyt hem word for word
As help me verray god  omnipotent
Though I right now  shulde make my testament
I owe hem nat a word  that it nys quytte
I brought it so aboute  be my wytte
That they must ȝeue it vp  for the best
Or elles had we neuere  ben in rest
ffor though he loked  as a wod lyon
Ȝet shulde he faile  of his conclusion
Than wold I sey  good lef take kepe
how mekely loketh  wylkyn oure shepe
Come neer my spouse  lat me ba thy cheke
Ȝe schulden be  al pacient and meke
And han a swete  spiced conscience
Sithe ȝe so preche  of Iobes pacience
Suffreth alwey  syn ȝe so wel can preche
And but ȝe do  certeyn we shuln ȝow teche
That it is fair  to han a wyf in pees
Oon of vs two  must bowen doutelees
And sithe a man  is more resonable
Than womman is  ȝe must ben suffrable
what eyleth ȝow  to grucche thus and grone
It is for ȝe wolde  han my queynte allone
we take it al  lo haue it euerydele
Petir I shrewe ȝow  but ȝe loue it wele
ffor if I wolde selle  my beal chose
I coude walke  as fressh as any Rose
But I wol kepe it  for ȝoure owen toth
Ȝe be to blame  by god I seye ȝow soth
Swiche maner wordes  had we on honde
Now wol I speke  of my first husbonde
 My first husbonde  was a reuelour
That is to seyn  he had a paramour
And I was ȝong  and ful of ragerie
Stiburne and strong  and ioly as a Pye


Tho coude I daunce  to an harp smale
And synge Iwysse  as any nytynggale
whan I had dronke  a draught of swete wyn
Metellius the foul cherl  the swyn
That with a staf  byreft his wyf hir lif
ffor she drank wyn  though I had ben his wyf
he shulde nat han daunted  me fro drynke
And after wyn  on venus must I thynke
ffor also siker  as cold engendereth hail
A likerous mouth  must han a likerous tail  
In womman vynolent  is no diffence
This knowen lecchours  be experience
But lord crist  whan that it remembreth me
Vpon my ȝouthe  and on my Iolyte
It tikeleth me  aboute myn hert rote
Vnto this day  it dooth myn hert bote
That I haue had my world  as in my tyme
But age allas  that al wyl envenyme
hath me byraft  my beaute and my pith
late go fare wel  the deuele goo therewith
The flour is goon  there is no more to telle
The bren as I beest can  now mot I selle
But ȝet to be right merye  wol I fonde
  Now forth to telle of my secund husbonde
I sey I had  in hert greet despit
That he of any other  had delit
But he was quyt  be god and be Seynt Ioce
I mad him of the same wode  a Croce
Nat of my body  in no foule manere
But certeynly  I made folk swich chere
That in his owen grees  I mad him frie
ffor anger  and for verrey Ielusie
By god  in erthe  I was his purgatorie
ffor whiche I hope  his soule be in glorie
ffor god it woot  he sat ful ofte and songe
whan that his shoo  ful bitterly him wronge


ffor there was no wyght  saue god and he þat wyst
In manye wyses  how sore I him twist
he deyed whan I come  fro Ierusalem
And lith in graue  vnder the roode Bem
Al is his toumbe  nought so curious
As was the sepulcre  of him Darius
whiche that Appollus  wrought so sotelly
It nys but waast  to bery him preciously
lat him fare wel  god ȝeue his soule good reest
he is now in his graue  and ded in his chest
 Now of my thridde husbonde  wol I telle
God lat his soule  neuere come in helle
And ȝet was he to me  the moost shrewe
That fele I now on my ribbes  al by rewe
And euere shal  vnto myn endyng day
But in oure bed  he was ful fressh and gay
And therewith also  wel coude he me gloose
whan that he wolde  han my beal chose
That though he had  me bete on euery bon  
he coude wynne  my loue ageyn anoon
I trowe I loued him best  for that he
was of his loue  daungerous vnto me
we wommen han  if that I shal nat lye
In this mater  a queynt fantasie
Wayte what thyng  we may nat lightly haue
Therafter wyl we crye al day  and craue
fforbede vs thyng  and that desiren we
Presse on vs fast  and than wol we flee
with daunger outer we  al oure chaffare
Greet prees at market  maketh dere ware
And to gret chep  is holden at litel pris
This knoweth euery womman  that is wys
  My ferthe husbonde  god his soule blisse
which that I took  for loue and no richesse
he somtyme was  a clerk of Oxenforde
And had left scole  and went at hom to borde


with my gossyp  dwellynge in oure toun
God haue hire soule  hire name was Alison
She knew myn hert  and al my preuytee
Bet than oure parissh preest  so mot I the
To hire bewreyed I  my counseil al
ffor had myn husbonde  pissed on a wal
Or don a thyng  that shuld han cost his lif
To hire  and to another worthy wyf
And to my Nece  whiche that I loued wel
I wold han told  his counseil euerydel
And so I dide ful often  god it woot
That mad his face  ful often red and hoot
ffor verray shame  and blamed himself for he
had told to me  so gret a preuytee
And so byfel  that ones in a lente
So often tymes  I to my gossip wente
ffor euere ȝet  I loued to be gay
And for to walke  in March  Aprill and May
ffro hous to hous  to here sondry tales
That Iankyn Clerk  and my gossip dame Ales
And I my selue  into the feeldes went
Myn husbonde was at london  al that lent
I had the betir leiser  for to pleye
And for to se  and eke for to be seye
Of lusty folk  what wyst I  where my grace
was shapen for to be  or in what place
Therfore made I  my visitasions  
To vigiles  and to processions
To prechynge eke  and to theise pilgrimages
To pleyes of miracles  and of mariages
And wered vpon  my gay skarlet gytes
Theise wormes  ne theise mothes  ne theise mytes
vpon my paraille  frette hem neuere a del
And wost þou why  for they were vsed wel
  Now wol I telle forth  what happed me
I seye that in the feldes  walked we


Til trewely we had  swich daliaunce
This clerk and I  that of my purueaunce
I spak to him  and seide how that he
If I were wydewe  he shulde wedde me
ffor certeynly I seye  for no bobaunce
Ȝet was I neuere  withouten purueaunce
Of mariage  ne of othere thynges eke
I hold a mouses hert  nat worth a leke
That hath but on hole  for to stirte to
And if that fayle  than is al Ido
I bar him on honde  he had enchaunted me
My dame taught me  that sotilte
And eke I seide  I mette of him al nyght
he wolde han slayn me  as I lay vp right
And al my bed  was ful of verray blod
But ȝet I hope  that ȝe shuln do me good
ffor blod bytokeneth gold  as me was taught
And al was fals  I dremed of it right nought
But as I folwed ay  my dames loore
As wel of that  as of othere thynges more
But now sire late me sen  what I shuld seyn
A ha by god  I haue my tale ageyn
  Whan that my fierthe husbonde  was on beere
I wep algate  and mad sory chere
As wyues moton  for it is the vsage
And with my kercheue  I couered my visage
But for that I was purueiede  of a make
I wepte but smale  and that I vndertake
To chirche was myn husbonde  born amorwe
with neyghebores  that for him maden sorwe
And Iankyn oure clerk  was oon of thoo
As helpe me god  whan that I saw him goo
After the beere  me thought he had a peire
Of legges and of feet  so clene and so feire
That al myn hert  I ȝaf vnto his holde
I trowe he was  a twenty wynter olde


And I was fourty  if I shal sey the sothe  
But ȝet I had alwey  a coltyssh tothe
Gattothed I was  and that becam me wele
I had the prente  of seynt venus seele
As help me god  I was a lusty oon
And fair and riche  and ȝonge  and wel bygon
And trewely  as myne husbondes tolde me
I had the best quoniam  that myght be
ffor certes I am  al venerien
In feelyng  and myn hert is Marcien
Venus me ȝaf my lust  my likerousnesse
And Mars ȝaf me  my sturdy hardynesse
Myn ascendent was Taur  and Mars þereInne
Allas allas  that euere loue was synne
I folwed alwey  myn inclynacione
By vertue  of myn Constellacione
That made me  I coude nat withdrawe
My chaumbre of venus  fro a good felawe
Ȝet haue I Mars merk  vpon my face
And also  in another pryue place
ffor god so wysely  be my sauacion
I loued neuere  by no discrecion
But euere folwed  myn appetit
Al were he short  long blak or whiȝt
I toke no kepe  so that he liked me
how poore he was  ne eke of what degree
  what shulde I seye  but at the monthes ende
This ioly Clerk  Iankyn þat was so hende
hath wedded me  with greet solempnytee
And to him ȝaf I  al the lond and fee
That euere was me ȝeuen  therebyfore
But afterward  me repented ful sore
he nolde suffre  no thyng of my list
By god he smot me  oonys with his fist
On the cheke  for þat I rent  out of his book a leef
That of the stroke  myn ere wex al deef


Stiburne I was  as is a leonesse
And of my tonge  a veray Iangeleresse
And walke I wold  as I had don byforn
ffrom hous to hous  although he had it sworn
ffor whiche  he often tymes wold preche
And me of olde Romayne gestes  teche
how he  simplicius Gallus  laft his wyf
And hire forsoke  for terme of al his lyf
nought but for openheded  he hire say
Lokyng out at his dore  vpon a day  
Another Romayne  told he me by name
That for his wyf  was at a Someres game
withouten his wetyng  he forsoke hire eke
And than wold he  vpon his bible seke
That ilke prouerbe  of ecclesiaste
where he comaundeth  and forbedeth faste
Man shal nat suffre his wyf  go royle aboute
Than wold he sey right thus  withoute doute
whoso that bildeth his hous  al of salwes
And priketh his blynd hors  ouer the falwes
And suffreth his wyf  to seken halwes
Is worthy to ben hanged  on the galwes
But al for nought  I sette nought an hawe
Of hise prouerbes  ne of his olde lawe
Ne I wold nat of him  corrected be
I hate him  that my vices telleth me
And so don moo of vs  god wot  than I
This mad him with me wood  al vtterly
I wold nat forbere him  in no cas
Now wyl I sey ȝow soth  by Seynt Thomas
why that I rent out  of his book a leef
ffor whiche he smot me so  that I was deef
he had a bok  that gladly nyght and day
ffor his desport  he wold it rede alway
he cleped it valerie  and Theofaste
At which book  he lough alwey ful fast


And eke there was somtyme  a Clerk at Rome
A Cardynale that hight  Seynt Ierome
That mad a book  ageyn Iovynyan
In whiche book eke  there was Terculan
Crisippus  Tortula  and Helowys
That was Abbesse  nat fer fro Parys
And eke the parobles  of Salamon
Ouydes art  and bookes many oon
And alle theise were bounden  in o volume
And euery nyght and day  was his custume
Whan he had leiser  and vacacione
ffrom other worldly  occupacione
To redyn in this book  of wykked wyues
he knew of hem  moo legendes and lyues
Than ben of goode wyues  in the bible
ffor trosteth wel  it is an inpossible
That any Clerk  wyl speke good of wyues
But if it be  of holy Seyntes lyues
Ne of noone othere wommen  neuere the moo
Who peynted the lyon  telle me who  
By god if a womman  had wryten stories
As Clerkes han  withInne here oratories
They wold han wretyn of men  more wykkednesse
Than al the mark of Adam  may redresse
The children of Mercurie  and of Venus
Ben in here werkyng  ful contrarious
Mercurie loueth wysdom  and science
And venus loueth riot  and despence
And for here dyuers  disposicion
Eche fayleth  in others exaltacion
As thus  god woot  Mercurie is desolate
In pisses  whan venus is exaltate
And venus falleth  there Mercurie is reised
Therfore no womman  of no Clerk is preysed
The Clerk whan he is old  and may nat do
Of venus werkes  worth his olde shoo


Than syt he doun  and wryteth in his dotage
That wommen conne nout kepen  here mariage
But now to purpos  why I tolde the
That I was beten  for a book parde
Vpon a nyght  Iankyn that was oure Sire
Red on his book  as he sat by the fyre
Of Eue first  that for hire wykkednesse
Was al mankynde brought  to wrechednesse
ffor which that ihesu crist  him self was slayn
That bought vs  with his hert blod agayn
loo heere expres of wommen  may ȝe fynde
That womman was the losse  of al mankynde
Tho redde he me  how Sampson loost hise heeres
Slepynge his lemman  kytte hem with hire sheres
Thurgh which treson  lost he bothe hise eyen
Tho redde he me  if that I shal nat lyen
Of Hercules  and of Dyanyre
That caused him  to sette him self afyre
Nothyng forgat he  the care and the woo1

That Socrates had  with hise wyues twoo
how Exantipa  cast pisse vpon hise bed
This sely man sat stille  as he were ded
he wypte his hed  no more durst he seyn
But er that the thonder stynt  cometh reyn
Of Phasipha  that was the Quene of Creete
ffor shrewednesse him thought  the tale swete
ffy speke no more  it is a grisly thyng
Of hire horrible lust  and hire lykyng
Of Clithermystra  for hire lecherie
That falsly mad hire husbonde  for to deye
He red it  with ful good deuocion  
he told me eke  for what occasion
Amphiorax at Thebes  lost his lyf
Myn husbond had a legend  of his wyf
Exiphilem  that for an ouche of gold
hath preuyly  vnto the grekes Itold


Where that hire husbonde  hid him in a place
ffor which he had  at Thebes sory grace
Of lyma told he me  and of lucye
They bothe maden  here husbondes for to deye
That on for loue  that other was for hate
lyma  hire husbonde  vpon an euen late
Enpoysoned hath  for that she was his foo
lucya lykerous  loued hire husbond so
That for he shuld alwey  vpon hire thynke
She ȝaf him swich  a maner loue drynke
That he was ded  er it were by the morwe
And thus algates  husbondes han sorwe
Than told he me  how on lathimyus
Compleyned  vnto his felawe  Arryus
That in his gardeyn  growed swich a tree
On which he seide  how that hise wyues three
honged hem self  for hertes dispetous
O lef brother  quod this Arryus
Ȝeue me a plante  of thilk blissed tre
And in myn gardeyn  planted shal it be
Of lattere date  of wyues hath he red
That some han slayn  here husbondes in here bed
And let hire lecchour  dight hire al the nyght
While that the cors  lay in the floor vpright
And some han dreuyn nayles  in here brayne
While that they slep  and thus they han hem slayne
Some han ȝeuen hem poyson  in here drynke
he spak more harm  than hert may bethynke
And therwithal  he knew of moo prouerbes
Than is this world  groweth gras or Erbes
Bet is quod he  thyn habitacion
Be with a lyon  or a foul dragon
Than with a womman  vsyng for to chide
Bet is quod he  hie in the roof abyde
Than with an angry womman  doun in the hous
They ben so wykked  and so contrarious

They haten  that here husbondes louen ay
he seide a womman  kast hire shame away
Whan she cast of hire smok  and fortheremoo
A fair womman  but she be chast also
Is lyke a gold ryng  in a sowes nose
Who wold wene  or who wold suppose  
The woo that in myn hert was  and the pyne
And whan I saw  he wolde neuere fyne
To reden on this cursed book  al nyght
Al sodeynly  three leeues haue I plight
Out of his booke  right as he radde  and eke
I with my fist  so toke him on the cheke
That in our fyr  he fel bakward adoun
And he vp stirt  as doth a wood lyon
And with his fist  he smot me on the hede
That in the floor  I lay as I were dede
And whan he saw  how stille that I lay
he was agast  and wold han fled away
Til at the last  out of my swough I brayde
O hast þou slayn me  fals theef I sayde
And for my lond  thus hast þou mordred me
Or I be ded  ȝet wole I kysse the
And ner he com  and kneled faire adoun
And seide deere Suster  Alisoun
As helpe me god  I shal the neuere smyte
That I haue doon  it is thy self to wyte
fforȝeue it me  and that I the byseke
And ȝet eftsones  I hitte him on the cheke
And seide thef  thus meche am I awreke
Now wol I dye  I may no lengere speke
But at the last  with mechil kare and woo
We fel accorded  be oure seluen twoo
he ȝaf me al the brydel  in myn honde
To han the gouernaunce  of hous and londe
And of his tonge  and of his hond also
And mad him brenne his book  anoon right thoo


And whanne that I had getyn vnto me
Be maistrye  al the Soueraynte
And that he seide  myn owen trewe wyf
Do as the list  the terme of al thy lyf
Kepe thyn honour  and kepe eke myn estate
And after that day  we hadden neuere debate
God help me so  I was to him as kynde
As any wyf  fro Denmark vnto Inde
And also trewe  and so was he to me
I preye to god  that sitteth in mageste
So blisse his soule  for his mercy deere
Now wol I seyn my tale  if ȝe wyln heere
  The ffrere lough  whan he had herd al this
Now dame quod he  so haue I ioye or blys
This is a long preamble  of a tale
And whan the sompnour  herd the ffrere gale
loo quod the sompnour  for goddes armes two
A ffrere wyl entermente him  euere moo  
loo goodmen  a flye and eke a ffrere
Wol falle in euery dissh  and eke matere
What spekest thow  of preambulacion
What aumble or trotte  or pes  or go sitte doun
Thow lettest oure disport  in this manere
 Ȝe wilt þou so Sompnour  quod the ffrere
Now be my feith  I shal er that I goo
Telle of Sompnoures  swich a tale or twoo
That alle folk  shuln laughen  in this place
Now elles ffrere  I beshrewe thyn face
Quod the Sompnour  and I beshrewe me
But if I telle tales  two or three
Of ffreres  or þat I come to Sydyngburne
That I shal make  thyn hert for to morne


ffor wel I wot  thy pacience is agon
 Oure host cried pees  and that anoon
And seide  late the womman telle hire tale
Ȝe fare as folk  that dronken ben of Ale
Do dame  telle forth ȝoure tale  and that is best
Al redy sire quod she  right as ȝow list
If I haue lycence  of this worthy ffrere
Ȝis dame quod he  tell forth  and I wyl here
In the olde dayes  of kyng Arthour
Of which that Bretons speken  gret honour
Al was this lond  fulfilled of fairie
The Elf Quene  with hire ioly companye
Daunced ful ofte  in many a grene mede
This was the olde oppynyon  as I rede
I speke of manye  hundred ȝeres ago
But now can no man  se noone Elues moo
ffor now the gret charite  and preyeres
Of lymytours  and other holy ffreres
That serchen euery lond  and euery streme
As thikke as motes  in the Sonne beme
Blissyng Halles  chaumbres  kychenes  boures
Citees  Burghes  Castelles  heye Toures
Thropes  Bernes  Shepenes  Deyries
This maketh that there ben  no fayeries
ffor there as wont  to walken was an Elf
There walketh now  the lymytour himself
In vndermeles  and in morwenynges  
And seith hise matynes  and his holy thynges
As he goth  in his lymytacion
wommen moun go now  safly vp and doun
In euery bussh  and vnder euery tree
There is noon other  Incubus but he
And he ne wyl do hem  but dishonour
 And so byfel  that this kyng Arthour
had in his hous  a lusty bacheler
That on a day  cam ridyng fro ryuer


And happed that allone  as he was born
he saw a mayde  walkyng him byforn
Of whyche mayde  anoon maugre hire hede
By verray force  byraft hire maydenhede
ffor which oppression  was swich clamour
And swich pursute  vnto the kyng Arthour
That dampned was this knyght  for to be deed
By cours of lawe  and shuld han loost his heed
Parauenture  swich was the statute thoo
But that the Quene  and othere ladies moo
So longe preyeden  the kyng of grace
Til he his lyf  him graunted in the place
And ȝaf him to the Quene  al at hire wylle
To chese wheither she wolde  him saue or spille
The Quene thanketh the kyng  with al hire myght
And aftir this  thus spak she to the knyght
Whan that she saw hire tyme  vpon a day
Thow stondest ȝet quod she  in swich array
That of thy lif  ȝet hast þou non seurte
I graunte the lif  if thow canst telle me
what thyng is it  that wommen most desiren
Be war  and kepe thyn nekke bon  from Iren
And if þou canst nat  telle it me anoon
Ȝet wol I ȝeue the  leue for to goon
A twelwemoneth and a day  to seche and leere
An answere sufficeant  in this matere
And seurte wol I haue  er that thow pace
Thy body for to ȝelden  in this place
Wo was this knyght  and sorwefully he syketh
But what  he may nat do  al as him liketh
And at the last  he ches him for to wende
And come ageyn  right at the ȝeres ende
with swich answere  as god him wold purueye
And taketh his leue  and wendeth forth his weye
he seketh euery hous  and euery place
where as he hopeth  for to fynden grace  

To lerne what thyng  wommen louen moost
But he ne coude  aryuen in no coost
where as he myght fynde  in this matere
Two creatures  accordynge in fere
Some seyden  wommen louen best richesse
Some seiden honour  some seyden Iolynesse
Some seiden riche aray  some seiden lust abedde
And ofte tymes to be wydewe  and wedde
Some seiden that oure hert  is most eased
whan that we ben  Iflatered  and Iplesed
he goth ful ny the sothe  I wol nat lye
A man shal wynne vs best  with flaterie
And with attendaunce  and besynesse
Ben we Ilymed  bothe more and lesse
And some seyn  that we louen best
ffor to be free  and do right as vs list
And that no man  repreeue vs  of oure vice
But seye  þat we ben wyse  and no thyng nyce
ffor trewely  there is noon of vs alle
If ony wyght  wyl clawe vs on the galle
That we nyl kyke  for he seith vs soth
Assay  and he shal fynde it  þat so doth
ffor be we neuere  so vicious withInne
we wol be holden  wys  and clene of synne
And some seiden  that gret delyt han we
ffor to be holden stable  and eke secree
And on a purpos  stedfastly to dwelle
And nought bewreye thyng  that men vs telle
But that tale is nought worth  a rake stele
Parde  we wommen  conne no thyng hele
wytnesse on Myda  wol ȝe here the tale
Ouyde amonges  othere thynges smale
Seide  Myda had  vnder his longe heeres
Growyng vpon his hed  two asses eres
The which vice he hid  as he best myght
fful sotilly  fro euery mannes sight


That saw his wyf  there wyst of it no moo
he loued hire most  and trosted hire also
he preyede hire  that to no creature
She shulde tellen  of his disfigure
She swor him nay  for al this world to wynne
She nolde do  that velanye or synne
To make hire husbonde  han so foul a name
She nolde nat telle it  for hire owen shame
But natheles  hire thought right that he deyed
That she so longe  shulde a counseil hide
Hire thought it swal  so sore aboute hire hert  
That nedely som word  hire must astert
And sithe she durst nat  telle it to no man
Doun to a Mareys  fast by  she ran
Til she come there  hire hert was afyre
And as a bytore  bumbleth in the myre
She leid her mouth  vnto the water doun
Bewreye me nat  thow water with thy soun
Quod she  to the I telle it and no moo
Myn husbonde hath long  asses Eres twoo
Now is myn hert al hol  now is it oute
I myght no lengere kepe it  out of doute
here may ȝe se  though we a tyme abyde
Ȝet out it must  we conne no counseil hide
The remenaunt of the tale  if ȝe wol here
Redeth Ouyde  and there ȝe may it lere
 This knyght of whiche  my tale is specially
whan that he saw  he myght nought come therby
This is to seyn  what wommen louen most
withInne his breest  ful sorweful was the goost
But hom he goth  he myght nat soiourne
The day was comen  þat homward must he turne
And in his wey  as happed him to ride
In al his care  vnder a fforest side
Whereas he sey  vpon a daunce goo
Of ladyes foure and twenty  and ȝet moo


Toward the which daunce  he drow ful ȝerne
In hope that he  sum wysdom shulde lerne
But certeynly  er he cam fully there
Ivanysshed was this daunce  he nyst where
No creature saw he  that bar lyf
Saue oon the grene  he saw sittyng a wyf
A foulere wyght  there may no man deuyse
Ageyn the knyght  this olde wyf gan aryse
And seide  sire knyght  here forth ne lith no wey
Telle me  what that ȝe seken  be ȝoure fey
Parauenture  it may the bettir be
Theise olde folk  conne mechil thyng quod she
My leue Moder  quod this knyght certeyn
I nam but ded  but if that I can seyn
what thyng it is  that womman most desire
Coude ȝe me wysse  I wolde wel quyte ȝour hire
Plyght me thy trouthe  here in myn hond quod she
The nexte thyng  that I requere the
Thow shalt it do  if it be in thy myght
And I wyl telle it ȝow  er it be nyght
Haue here my trouthe  quod the knyght I graunte  
Than quod she  I dar me wel avaunte
Thy lif is saf  for I wol stonde therby
Vpon my lif  the Quene wol seye as I
lat se  which is the pruddest  of hem alle
That wereth on  a kerchef or a calle
That dar say nay  of that I shal the teche
lat vs go forth  withouten lengere speche
Tho rovned she  a pistel in his eere
And bad him to be glad  and haue no fere
 Whan they ben comen  to the court  this knyght
Seyde  he had hold his day  as he had hight
And redy was his answere  as he seide
fful many a noble wyf  and many a mayde
And many a wydewe  for that they ben wyse
The Quene hire self  sittynge as Iustise


Assembled been  his answere for to here
And afterward  this knyght was bode appere
To euery wyght  comaunded was silence
And that the knyght  shulde telle in audience
What thyng  that worldly wommen  louen best
This knyght ne stod nat stille  as doth a best
But to this question  anoon answerede
with manly voys  that al the courte it herde
My liege lady  generally quod he
wommen desiren  to han soueraignete
As wel ouer hire husbonde  as hire loue
And for to ben  in maistrie him aboue
This is ȝoure most desire  though ȝe me kille
Doth as ȝow list  I am here at ȝoure wylle
 In al the courte  ne was there wyf ne mayde
Ne wydewe  that contraried that he sayde
But seiden he was worthy  to haue his lyf
And with that word  vp stirt this olde wyf
which that the knyght saw  sittyng on the grene
Mercy quod she  my souereyne lady Quene
Er that ȝoure courte departe  do me right
I taught this answere  vnto the knyght
ffor which he plight me  his trouthe there
The first thyng  that I wolde him requere
he wolde it do  if it lay in his myght
Byfore this courte  than preye I the sire knyght
Quod she  that þou me take vnto thy wyf
ffor wel thow wost  that I haue kept thy lif
If I sey fals  sey nay vpon thy fey
 This knyght answered  allas and weilawey
I wot right wel  þat swich was myn byheste
ffor goddes loue  as chese a newe requeste  
Take al my good  and late my body goo
Nay thanne quod she  I shrewe vs bothe twoo
ffor though that I be foul  old and pore
I nold for al the metal  ne for ore


That vnder erthe is graue  or lith aboue
But if thy wyf I were  and eke thy loue
 My loue quod he  nay my dampnacione
Allas that ony  of my nacione
Shulde euere so foule  desparaged be
But al for nought  the end is this  that he
Constreyned was  he nedes must hire wedde
And taketh this old wyf  and goth to bedde
Now wolde somme men seyn  parauenture
That for my negligence  I do no cure
To telle ȝow the ioye  and al the array
That at the fest was  that ilke day
To which thyng  shortly answeren I shal
I seye there was no feest  ne ioye at al
There nas but heuynesse  and mechel sorwe
ffor preuyly he wedded hire  on the morwe
And al day after  hid him as an Owle
So woo was him  his wyf loked so foule
Gret was the woo  the knyght had in his thought
whan he was with his wyf  abedde Ibrought
he walueth  and he turneth to and froo
This olde wyf  lay smylyng euere moo
And seide  o dere husbonde benedicite
ffareth euery knyght thus  with his wyf as ȝe
Is this the lawe  of kyng Arthoures hous
Is euery knyght of his  thus daungerous
I am ȝoure owen loue  and eke ȝoure wyf
I am she  which þat saued hath ȝoure lyf
And certes  ȝet ne dide I ȝow  neuere vnright
Why fare ȝe thus with me  this first nyght
Ȝe faren like a man  had lost his wytte
what is my gilt  for goddes loue telle itte
And it shal ben amended  if I may
Amendid  quod this knyght  allas nay nay
It wol not ben amended  neuere moo
Thow art so lothly  and so old also


And therto comen  of so lowe a kynde
That lytel wonder is  though I walwe and wynde
So wolde god  myn hert wold brest
Is this quod she  the cause of ȝoure vnrest
Ȝee certeynly quod he  no wonder is
Nowe sire quod she  I coude amende al this  
If that me list  er it were dayes three
So wel ȝe myght bere ȝow  vnto me
 But for ȝe speken  of swich gentilnesse
As is descendid  out of olde richesse
That therfore ȝe shulden  ben gentilmen
Swich arrogance  is nat worth an hen
loke who that is most  vertuous alwey
Preue and apert  and most entendeth ay
To do the gentil dedis  that he can
Take him for the grettist  gentil man
Crist wol we clayme of him  our gentilnesse
Nought of our eldres  for here old richesse
ffor though they ȝeue vs  al here heritage
ffor which we cleyme  to be of hey parage
Ȝet may they nat bequethe  for no thyng
To noon of vs  here vertuous leuyng
That mad hem gentil men  called to be
And bad vs folwen hem  in swich degree
wel can the wys Poete  of fflorence
That hight Dant  speken of this sentence
lo in swych maner ryme  is Dantes tale
fful seld vp riseth  by his braunches smale
Prowesse of man  for god of his goodnes
wol  that of him we clayme  oure gentilnes
ffor of oure auncestres  mow we no thyng clayme
But temporal thyng  that man may hurt and mayme
Euery wyght wot this  as wel as I
If gentilnesse were plaunted  naturelly
vnto a certeyn lynage  doun the lyne
Pryue and apert  than wold they neuere fyne


To don of gentilnesse  the fair office
They myght do  no velanye or vice
Tak fir and bere it  in the derkest hous
Betwix this  and the Mount of Caukasous
And lete men shette the dores  and go thenne
Ȝet wol the fyr  as faire lye and brenne
As twenty thousand men  myght it byholde
his office naturel  ay wol it holde
vp peril of my lif  til that it deye
here may ȝe se wel  how that gentrie
Is nat annexed  to possessione
Sith folk ne doon  here operacione
Alwey as doth the fir  lo in his kynde
ffor god it wot  men moun wel often fynde
A lordes sone do shame  and velanye
And he that wol han  prys of his gentrye
ffor he was born  of a gentil hous
And had hise auncestres  noble and vertuous
And nyl him seluen  do no gentil dedes  
Ne folwe his gentil auncetrye  that ded is
he is nat gentil  be he Duke or Erl
ffor vyleyns synful dedes  maken a Cherl
ffor gentilnesse  nys but renounee
Of thyn Auncestres  for here heye bounte
which is a straunge thyng  to thy persone
Thy gentilnesse cometh  fro god allone
Thanne cometh oonly  our gentilnesse of grace
It was no thyng bequethed vs  with oure place
Thynketh how noble  as seith valerius
was thilke Tullius  hostilius
That out of pouerte roos  to heygh noblesse
Redeth Senek  and redeth eke Boece
There shul ȝe sen expresse  that no dred is
That he is gentil  that doth gentil dedis
And therfore leue husbonde  I thus conclude
Al were it  that myne Auncestres weren rude


Ȝet may the heye god  and so hope I
Graunte me grace  to lyuen vertuously
Than am I gentil  whan that I begynne
To lyuen vertuously  and weyven synne
 And there as ȝe  of pouerte me repreeue
The heye god  on whom that we byleue
In wylful pouert  ches to leue his lyf
And certes euery man  Mayden or wyf
May vnderstonde  that Ihesus heuene kyng
Ne wold nat chese  a vicious lyuyng
Glad pouerte  is an honest thyng certeyn
This wol Senek  and othere clerkes seyn
whoso that halt him paid  of his pouerte
I holde him riche  al had he nought a shert
he that coueyteth  is a pore wyght
ffor he wold han  that is nought in his myght
But he that nought hath  ne coueyteth to haue
Is riche  although ȝe hold him but a knaue
verray synne pouerte  is proprely
Iuuenal speketh  of pouerte merily
The pore man  whan he goth by the wey
Byfore the theues  he may synge and pley
Pouerte is hateful good  and as I gesse
A ful greet bryngere  out of besynesse
A gret amendere eke  of sapience
To him that taketh it  in pacience
Pouerte is this  although it seme alenge
Possession  that no wyght wol chalenge
Pouerte ful often  whan a man is lowe
Maketh his god  and eke him self to knowe  
Pouerte  a spectakil is  as thynketh me
Thurgh which he may  his verray frendes se
And þerfore sire  syn that I nouȝt ȝow greue
Of my pouerte  no more ȝe me repreeue
Now sire  of elde ȝe repreeue me
And certes sire  though non auctorite


were in no book  ȝe gentiles of honour
Seyn  þat men shulde  an olde wyght do fauour
And clepe him fader  for ȝoure gentilnesse
And auctoures shal I fynden  as I gesse
Now there as ȝe seyn  þat I am foul and old
Than drede ȝow nought  to ben a Cokewold
ffor filthe and elde  also mot I the
Ben grete wardeyns  vpon chastite
But neueretheles  syn I knowe ȝoure delite
I shal fulfille  ȝoure worldly appetite
Chese now quod she  on of theise thynges twey
To han me foul and old  til that I dey
And be to ȝow  a trewe humble wyf
And neuere ȝow displese  in al my lyf
Or ellis ȝe wyl han me  ȝong and faire
And take ȝoure auenture  of the repaire
That shal be to ȝoure hous  bycause of me
Or in som other place  it may wel be
Now chese ȝoure self  wheiþer that ȝow liketh
This knyght auyseth him  and sore syketh
But at the last  he seide in this manere
My lady and my loue  and wyf so dere
I putte me  in ȝoure wyse gouernaunce
Cheseth ȝoure self  which may be most plesaunce
And most honour  to ȝow and me also
I do no force  wheither of the two
ffor as ȝow liketh  it suffiseth me
Then haue I get of ȝow  the maistrye quod she
Syn I may chese  and gouerne as me list
Ȝe certes wyf quod he  I holde it the best
Kisse me quod she  we be no lengere wrothe
ffor be my trouthe  I shal be to ȝow bothe
This is to seyn  ȝe bothe fair and good
I preye to god  that I mot steruen wood
But I to ȝow  be also good and trewe
As euere was wyf  sithe þat the world was newe


And but I be tomorwe  as fair to sene
As any lady  Emperesse or Quene
That is betwix the Est  and eke the west
Do with my lif and deth  right as ȝow list
Cast vp the curtyn  loke how that it is  
And whan þat the knyght  saw verreyly al this
That she so fair was  and so ȝong therto
ffor ioye he hent hire  in hise armes two
his hert bathed  in a bath of blisse
A thousand tymes a rowe  he gan hire kysse
And she obeyed him  in euery thyng
That myght don him plesaunce or likyng
And thus they leue  vnto here lyues ende
In parfyt ioye  and ihesu crist vs sende
husbondes meke  ȝonge and fressh abedde
And grace to ouerbyde hem  that we wedde
And eke I preye ihesu  shorte here lyues
That nought wyl be gouerned  by here wyues
And olde and angry  nygardes of despence
God sende hem sone  verray pestilence
THis worthy Lymytour  this noble frere
he make alwey  a maner louryng chere
vpon this Sompnour  but for honeste
No vyleyns word  to him as ȝet spak he
But at the laste  he seide vnto the wyf
Dame quod he  god ȝeue ȝow right good lyf
Ȝe han here touched  also mot I the
In scole mater  a greet difficultee
Ȝe han seide meche thyng  right wel I seye
But Dame  here as we riden  by the weye
vs nedeth nought to speken  but of game
Ane lete auctorites be  a goddes name
To prechynge and to scole  of clergie
And if it like  vnto this compaignye
I wyl ȝow of a Sompnour  telle a game
Parde ȝe may wel knowen  by the name
That of a Sompnour  may no good be seide
I preye that noon of ȝow  be euele apayde
A Sompnour is a rennere  vp and doun
With maundementeȝ  for ffornicacion
And is Ibete  at euery tounes ende
 Oure host tho spak  a sire ȝe shuld ben hende
And curteys  as a man of ȝoure estat
In compaignye  we wyln haue noon debat
Telleth ȝoure tale  and late the Sompnour be  
Nay quod the Sompnour  late him sey to me
What so him list  whan it cometh to my lot
By god I shal him quyten  euery grot
I shal him telle  which a gret honour
It is to be  a flateryng lymytour
And eke  of ful many another crime
Which nedeth nat  to rehercen at this tyme
And his office  I shal him telle Iwys
 Oure host answered  pees nomore of this
And after this  he seide vnto the ffrere
Telleth forth ȝoure tale  myn owen maister dere

WHilom there was dwellyng  in my contree
An Archedekene  a man of hey degree
That boldely  dede  execucion
In punysshyng  of fornicacion
Of wychecraft  and eke of baudrye
Of diffamacion  and aduoutrye
Of chirche Reues  and of testamentes
Of Contractes  and of lak of Sacramentes
Of Vsurie  and of Symonye also
But certis lecchours  dide he grettest woo
They shulden synge  if that they were hent
And smale titheres  weren foule Ishent
If ony Persone  wold vpon hem pleyne
There myght astert him  no pecunyal peyne
ffor smale tithes  and for smale offrynge
he mad the peeple  pytously to synge
ffor er the Busshop  caught hem with his hoke
They weren  in the Archedekenes boke
And than had he  thurgh his Iurisdiccion
Power  to don on hem correccion
he had a sompnour  redy to his hond
A Slier boy  was noon in Engelond
ffor sotilly he had  his espialle
That taught him wele  where it myght availle
he coude spere  of lecchoures oon or twoo
To techen him  to foure and twenty moo
ffor though this sompnour  wod were as an hare
To telle hise harlotrie  I wyl nat spare


ffor we ben out  of here correccion
They han of vs  no Iurisdiccion
Ne neuere shuln  terme of al here lyues  
Peter so ben the wommen  of the styues
Quod the sompnour  I put out of our cure
Pees with myschaunce  and with mysauenture
Thus seide oure host  and late him telle his tale
Now telleth forth  and lat the Sompnour gale
Ne spareth nought  myn owen maister deere
This fals thef  this Sompnour  quod the frere
had alwey  Baudes  redy to his hond
As ony hauke  to lure in Engelond
That told him al the secree  that they knewe
ffor hire acqueyntaunce  was nat comen of newe
They weren hise approwoures  preuyly
he tok him self  a gret profyt therby
his maister knew nat alwey  what he wan
Withouten maundement  a lewed man
he coude sompne  vp peyne of cristes curs
And they were Inly glad  for to fille his purs
And make him greete festis  at the nale
And right as Iudas  had purses smale
And was a thef  right swich a thef was he
his maister had but half  his duete
he was  if I shal ȝeuen him his lavde
A thef  and eke a sompnour  and a baude
he had eke wenchis  at his retynew
That wheither sire Robert  or sire Heughe
Or Iohn or Raf  or whoso that it were
That lay by hem  they told it in his eere
Thus was the wenche  and he of oon assent
And he wold fecche  a feyned maundement
And sompne hem to chapetle  bothe two
And pille the man  and late the wenche go
Than wold he sey frend  I shal for thy sake
Do strike the out  of oure lettres blake


The thar no more  as in this cas trauaille
I am thy frend  there I may the auaille
Certeyn he knew  of bryboures moo
Than possible is  to telle in ȝeres twoo
ffor in this world  nys dogge for the bowe
That can an hurt deer  from an hol bet knowe
Than that this Sompnour  knew a sly lechour
Or on aduouter  or a Paramour
And for that was the fruyt  of al his rente
Therefore on it he sette  al his entente
And so byfel  that ones vpon a day
This sompnour euere  waytyng on his pray
Rod for to sompne  an old wyf orrible  
ffeynyng a cause  for he wold hire brydle
And happed that he saw  byforn him ryde
A gay ȝoman  vnder a forest syde
A bowe he bar  and arwes bryght and kene
he had vpon  a courteby of Grene
An hat vpon his hed  with frenges blake
Sire quod this sompnour  heyl and wel atake
Welcome quod he  and euery good felawe
Whider ridest þou  vnder this grene wode shawe
Seide this ȝoman  wylt þou fer today
This sompnour answered  and seide nay
heere fast by quod he  is myn entent
To riden  for to reysen vp  a rent
That longeth to my lordes  duete
A  art thow thanne a bayly  ȝe quod he
he durst nat for verray velanye  and shame
Sey that he was a sompnour  for the name
Depardeux quod this ȝoman  dere brother
Thow art a Bailly  and I am another
I am vnknowen  as in this contree
Of thyn acqueyntaunce  I wold preye the
And eke of brotherhede  if that thow list
I haue gold and siluer  in my chest


If that the happed  to come into our shire
Al shal be thyn  right as thow wolt desire
Graunt mercy quod this Sompnour  be my feith
Euerych in otheres hand  his trouthe leith
ffor to be sworn bretheren  til that they deye
In daliaunce they reden forth  and pleye
This sompnour which þat was  as ful of Iangles
As ful of venym ben  theise wariangles
And euere enqueryng  vpon euery thyng
Brother quod he  where is now  ȝoure dwellyng
Another day  if that I shuld ȝow seche
This ȝeman him answered  in softe speche
Brother quod he  fer in the North contree
Where as I hope  somtyme I shal the se
Er we departe  I shal the so wel wysse
That of myn hous  ne shalt þou neuere mysse
Now Brother quod this Sompnour  I ȝow preye
Teche me  whil we riden by the weye
Syn that ȝe ben  a Bailly  as am I
Som sotiltee  and telle me feithfully
In myn office  how that I may most wynne
And spareth nat  for conscience or for synne
But as my brother  tell me how do ȝe  
Now be my trouthe  dere brother seyde he
As I shal tellen the  a feithful tale
My wages ben ful streyte  and eke ful smale
My lord is hard to me  and daungerous
And myn office  is ful laborious
And therefore  by extorcions I lyue
fforsothe I tak  al that men wol me ȝeue
Algate by sleighte  or by violence
ffro ȝere to ȝere  I wynne al my dispence
I can no betir tellen  feithfully
 Now certis quod this Sompnour  so fare I
I spare nat to take  god it wot
But if it be to heuy  or to hot


What I may gete  in counseil preuyly
No manere conscience  of that haue I
Ner myn extercion  I might nat lyuen
Ne of swich Iapes  wol I nat be shreuen
Stomak ne conscience  knowe I noon
I shrewe theise shriftefaderes  euerychon
Wel be we mette  by god and by Seynt Iame
But leue brother  telle me thy name
Quod this Sompnour  right in this mene while
This ȝeman gan  a litel for to smyle
Brother quod he  wylt þou that I the telle

And here I ryde  aboute my purchasyng
To wete  where men wold me ȝeue  ony thyng
My purchas is the effect  of al my rent
loke how thow ridest  for the same entent
To wynne good  thow rekkest neuere how
Ryght so fare I  for ride wold I now
Vnto the worlddes ende  for a preye
 A quod this Sompnour  benedicite what ȝe seye

Ȝe han a mannes shap  as wel as I

In helle there ȝe ben  in ȝoure estate
Nay certeynly quod he  there han we noone
But whan vs liketh  we can take vs one
Or ellis make ȝow seme  we ben shape
Somtyme lyke a man  or lyke an Ape
Or lyke an Aungel  can I ride or go
It is no wonder thyng  though it be so
A lousy Iogelour  can disceyue the
And parde ȝet can I  moore craft than he
Why quod this Sompnour  ride ȝe than or gon  
In sondry shap  and nat alwey in oon
ffor we quod he  wyln vs swich formes make
As most able is  our preyes for to take


What maketh ȝow  to han al this labour
fful many a cause  leue sire Sompnour
Seide this fende  but al thyng hath tyme
The day is short  and it is passed pryme
And ȝet ne wan I  no thyng in this day
I wol entende  to wynnyng if I may
And nat entende  oure wyttes to declare
ffor brother myn  thy wyt is al to bare
To vnderstonde  although I told hem thee
But for thow axest  why laboren we
ffor somtyme we ben  goddis Instrumentis
And meenes to do  his comaundementis
Whan that him list  vpon his creaturis
In diuerse actes  and in dyuers fyguris
Withouten him  we han no myght certayne
If that him list  to stonden there agayne
And somtyme at oure preyer  han we leue
Oonly the body  and nat the soule greue
Wytnesse on Iob  whom that we dedyn woo
And somtyme han we myght  of bothe twoo
This is to seyn  of soule and body eke
And somtyme be we  suffred for to seke
Vpon a man  and do his soule vnrest
And nat his body  and al is for the best
Whan he withstondeth  our temptacion
It is the cause of his  saluacion
Al be it  that it was  nat oure entente

And somtyme be we  seruaunt vnto man
As to the Erchebusshop  seynt Dunstan
And to the Apostles  seruaunt eke was I
 Ȝet telle me quod the sompnour feithfully
Make ȝe ȝow newe bodyes  thus alwey
Of Elementis  the fend answered nay
Sumtyme we feyne  and sumtyme we aryse
With dede bodyes  in ful sondry wyse


And speke as renably  and faire and wel
As to Phitonissa  dide Samuel
And ȝet wyl somme men seyn  it was nat he

But of o thyng I warne the  I wol nat Iape
Thow wolt algates wete  how we be shape
Thow shalt here afterward  my brother deere
Come there  the nedeth nat of me to lere

Come in a chayer  rede al this sentence
Bette than virgile  while he was on lyue
Or Dant also  nowe late vs ride blyue

 Nay quod this sompnour  that shal nat betide

My trouthe wol I holde  as in this caas
ffor though thow were  the deuele Sathanas
My trouthe wyl I holde  to the my brother
As I haue sworn  and ech of vs to other
ffor to be trewe bretheren  as in this cas
And bothe we gon  abouten oure purchas
Take thow thy part  what þat men wol the ȝeue
And I shal myn  thus may we bothe leue
And if that any of vs  haue more than other
Lat him be trewe  and part it with his brother
 I graunte quod the Deuele  be my fey
And with that word  they ryden forth here wey
And right at the entryng  of the tounes ende
To which this sompnour  shop him for to wende
They saw a cart  that charged was with hey
Which that a Cartere  drof forth in his wey
Depe was the weye  for which the cart stode
This Cartere smot  and cried as he were wode
hayt Brok hayt Skot  what spare ȝe for the stones

Nay quod the deuele  god wot neuere a dele

Aske him thy selue  if þou nat trowest me
Or ellys stynt a while  and þou shalt se
This Cartere takkith his hors  on the croupe
And they bygonne  to drawen and to stoupe

And al his handwerk  bothe more and lesse
That was wel twyt  my owen lyard boy

Brother quod he  here woneth an olde rebekke
That had almost  as lef to lese hire nekke
As for to ȝeue  a peny of hire good

Or I wyl somoune hire  vnto oure office
And ȝet god wot  of hire knowe I no vice
But for þou canst not  as in this contree
Wynne thy cost  take here ensaumple of me


This sompnour clappeth  at the wydewes gate
Come out quod he  thow old  very trate

Now lord quod she  crist ihesu  kyng of kynges
So wysly help me  as I ne may

But I be ded  so pryketh it in my syde
May I nat aske  a libel sire sompnour
And answere there  be my procuratour
To swiche thyng  as men wold appose me
Ȝis quod this sompnour  paye anoon lat se
Twelue pens to me  and I wol the acquyte

My Maister hath the profyt  and nat I
Come of  and late me ryden  hastily
Ȝeue me twelue pans  I may no lengere tarye
Twelue pens quod she  now lady Seynt Marye
So wysly help me  out of care and synne
This wyde world  though þat I shuld it wynne
Ne haue I nat twelue pans  withInne myn holde
Ȝe knowen wel  that I am pore and olde
Kythe ȝoure almesse  on me pore wrecche
Nay thanne quod he  the foule fend me fecche
If I the excuse  though thow shuldest be spilt  
Allas quod she  god wot I haue no gilt
Paie me quod he  or by the swete Seynt Anne

 Thow lixt quod she  be myn saluacion
Ne was I neuere or now  wydewe ne wyf
Somound vnto ȝoure court  in al my lyf
Ne neuere I nas  but of my body trewe
vnto the deuele blak  and row of hewe
Ȝeue I thy body  and my panne also
And whanne the deuele  herd hire cursen so
Vpon hire knees  he seide in this manere
Now Mabily  myn owen moder deere
Is this ȝoure wylle in ernest  that ȝe seye
The deuele quod she  so fecche him or he deye
And panne and al  but he wol him repente
Nay olde stot  that is nat myn entente
Quod this sompnour  for to repente me

Now brother quod the deuele  be nat wroth
Thy body and this panne  ben myn be right
Thow shalt to helle  with me  ȝet tonyght
There thow shalt knowen  of oure pryuete
More than a Maister  of dyuynyte
And with that word  this foul fend him hente
Body and soule  he with the deuele wente
Where as theise Sompnoures  han here heritages
And god that made  aftir his Image
Mankynde saue  and gyde  vs alle and some
And leue this sompnour  good man to bycome
 lordynggis I coude haue told ȝow  quod this ffrere
had I had lesyer  for this sompnour heere
After the tixt of crist  Poule and Iohn
And of oure othere doctoures  many oon
Swiche peynes  that ȝoure hertes myght agryse
Al be it so  no tonge may it deuyse
Though that I myght  a thousand wynter telle
The peynes of that cursed hous  in helle


But for to kepe vs  fro that cursed place
Waketh and preyeth  ihesu for his grace
So kepe vs  fro the temptour Sathanas
herkeneth this word  bywar as in this cas
The lyon sitteth  in his wayte alwey
To slee the Innocent  if that he may
Disposeth ay ȝoure hertis  to withstonde  
The fend  that ȝow wol make  thral and bonde
he may nat tempten ȝow  ouer ȝoure myght
ffor crist wol be ȝoure champion  and ȝoure knyght
And preyeth that theise Sompnours  hem repent
Of here misdedis  or that the fend hem hent
This Sompnour  in hise stiropes heye stode
Vpon this frere  his hert was so wode
That like an Aspen lef  he quok for ire
lordynggis quod he  but o thyng I desire
I ȝow byseche  that of ȝoure curteisye
Syn ȝe han herd  this fals frere lye
As suffreth me  I may my tale telle
This frere bosteth  that he knoweth helle
And god it woot  that is but litel wonder
ffreres and fendes  ben but lite asonder
ffor parde  ȝe han ofte tyme herd telle
how that a frere  rauysshed was to helle
In spirit oones  by a vysion
And as an Aungel  led him vp and doun
To shewen him  the peynes that there were
In al that place  saw he nat a frere
Of othere folk  he saw Inowe in woo
vnto this Aungel  spak this frere thoo
 Now sire quod he  han freres swich a grace
That noone of hem  shal comen in this place
Ȝis quod this Aungel  many a mylioun
And vnto Sathanas  he led him doun
And now hath Sathanas  seith he  a tayle
Braddere than of a Caryk  is the sayle
hold vp thy tayl  thow sathanas quod he
Shewe forth thyn Ars  and late the frere se
Where is the nest  of freres in this place
And er that half a furlong weye  of space


Right so as Bees  out swarmen of an hyue
Out of the Deueles Ars  they gonne dryue
Twenty thousand freres  on a route
And thurghout helle  they swarmed al aboute
And comen ageyn  as fast as they moun gon
And in his Ars  they crepten euerychon
he clapte his tayl ageyn  and lay full stille
This frere  whan he loked had  his fille
vpon the turmentes  of this sory place
His spirit  god restored  of his grace  
vnto his body aȝein  and he awoke
But natheles  for feer  ȝet he quoke
So was the deueles ars  ay in his mynde
That is hise Eritage  of verrey kynde
God saue ȝow alle  saue this cursed ffrere
My prolog wol I ende  in this manere
Lordyngges there is  in ȝorkshire as I gesse
A mersshy contre  called Holdernesse
In which there wente  a lymytour aboute
To preche and eke to begge  it is no doute
And so byfel  that on a day this frere
Had preched at a chirche  in his manere
And specially  abouen euery thynge
Excited he the peeple  in his prechynge
To trentales  and to ȝeuen for goddis sake
Wherewith men myght  holy houses make
There as diuine seruyse  is honoured
Nat there as it is wasted  and deuoured
Ne there it nedeth nat  for to be ȝeue
As to possessioneres  that moun lyue
Thanked be god  in wele and habundaunce
Trentals quod he  delyueren fro penaunce
here frendes soules  as wel old as ȝonge
Ȝa  whan that they ben  hastily Isonge
Nat for to holden a prest  Ioly and gay
he syngeth nat  but oo masse on a day
Delyuereth out anon quod he  the soules
fful hard it is  with flesshoke  or with owles
To ben Iclawed  or to brenne or bake
Now spede ȝow hastily  for cristes sake
And whan this frere  had seid al his entente
With Qui cum patre  forth his weye he wente
 Whanne folk in chirche  had ȝeuen him what hem list
he went his wey  no lengere wold he rest


With skrippe and tipped staf  Itukked heye
In euery hous  he gan to poore and prye
And begged mele and chese  or ellis corn
his felawe had a staf  typped with horn
A peyre of tables  al of yuory
And a poyntel  polysshed fetisly
And wrot the names alwey  as he stode
Of alle folk  that ȝaf hem any good
Ascaunce that he wold  for hem preye
Ȝeue vs a busshel whete  malt or reye
A goddis kechel  or a tryp of chese  
Or ellis what ȝow list  we moun nat chese
A goddis halpeny  or a masse peny
Or ȝeue vs of ȝoure brawne  if ȝe haue eny
A dagon of ȝoure blanket  lef dame
loo deere suster  heere wryte I ȝoure name
Bacon or Beef  or swich thyng as ȝe fynde
 A sturdy harlot  went hem ay behynde
That was here hostis man  and bar a sak
And that men ȝaf hem  leide it on his bak
And whan that he was  out at the dore  anoon
he planed awey  the names euerychon
That he byforn had wretyn  in his tables
he serued hem with nyfles  and with fables
 Nay there thow lixt  thow Sompnour quod the frere
Pees quod oure host  for cristes moder deere
Telle forth thy tale  and spare it nat at al
So thryue I quod this sompnour  so I shal
So longe he went  fro hous to hous  til he
Cam to an hous  there he was wont to be
Refresshed moore  than in an hundred places
Seke lay the bonde man  whos the place is
Bedred vpon a couche  lowe he lay
Deus hic quod he  O Thomas frend good day
Seide this frere  curteisly and softe
Thomas quod he  god ȝelde ȝow  ful ofte


haue I vpon this benche  faren ful wele
heere haue I eten  ful many a mery mele
And fro the benche  he drof awey the cat
And leide adoun his potent  and his hat
And eke his skrippe  and sette him softe adoune
his felawe was gon  walked in to toune
fforthwith his knaue  into that hostelrye
Where as he shop him  thilke nyght to lye
O deere maister  quod this syke man
how han ȝe faren  syn that Marche bygan
I saw ȝow nat  this fourtene nyght or more
God wot quod he  laboured haue I sore
And specially  for thy saluacione
haue I seid  many a precious orisone
And for oure oþere frendis  god hem blisse
I haue today ben  at ȝoure chirche at messe
And seid a sermoun  to my symple wytte
Nat al after the text  of holy wrytte
ffor it is hard to ȝow  as I suppose
And therfore wol I telle ȝow  al the glose
Glosyng  is a ful glorious thyng  certeyn
ffor lettre sleeth  so as we clerkes seyn  
There haue I taught hem  to be charitable
And spende here good  there it is resonable
And there I saw oure dame  a where is she
Ȝonder in the ȝerd  I trowe that she be
Seyde this man  and she wyl come anoon
 Ey Maister welcome be ȝe  be Seynt Iohn
Seide this wyf  how fare ȝe hertily
The frere ariseth vp  ful curteisly
And hire embraceth  in his armes narwe
And kist hire swete  and chirketh as a sparwe
With hise lippes  dame quod he right wel
As he that is ȝoure seruaunt  euerydel
Thanked be god  þat ȝow ȝaf soule and lyf
Ȝet saw I nat this day  so fair a wyf


In al the chirche  god so saue me
Ȝe god amende defautes  sire quod she
Algates wolcome be ȝe  be my fay
Graunt mercy dame  this haue I founde alway
But of ȝoure greet goodnesse  be ȝoure leeue
I wolde preye ȝow  that ȝe nat ȝow greeue
I wol with Thomas  speke a litel throwe
Theise curatours  ben so negligent  and slowe
To gropen tenderly  a conscience
In shrift  in prechynge  is my diligence
And studye  in Petres wordes  and in Poules
I walke and fisshe  mennes soules
To ȝelden ihesu crist  his propre rent
To sprede his word  is sette al myn entent
 Now be ȝoure leue  deere sire quod she
Chideth him wele  for seynt charite
he is as angry  as a Pissemyre
Though that he haue  al that he can desire
Though I him wrye a nyght  and make him warme
And ouer him leye  my legge and eke myn arme
he groneth lyke oure Boor  lith in oure sty
Other disport of him  right noon haue I
I may nat pleese him  in no maner caas
O Thomas ieo vous dye  Thomas Thomas
This maketh the fend  this must ben amended
Ire is a thyng  that heye god defended
And therof wol I speke  a word or twoo
Now maister quod the wyf  or that I goo
What wol ȝe dyne  I wol go theraboute
Now dame quod he  now ieo vous die saunȝ doute
haue I nat of a Capone  but the lyuere
And of ȝoure white bred  no but a shyuere
And after that  a rosted pygges hede  
But that I nolde for me  no beest were dede
Than had I with ȝow  homly sufficeaunce
I am a man  of litel sustenaunce


My spirit hath his fostrynge  in the bible
My body is ay so redy  and so penyble
To wake  that my stomak is destroyed
I preye ȝow dame  that ȝe be nat anoyed
Though I so frendly  ȝow my counseil shewe
By god I nold han told it  but a fewe
 Now sire quod she  but a word or I goo
My child is deed  withinne theise wekes twoo
Sone after that ȝe went  out of this Toun
 his deth saw I  by reuelacion
Seide this ffrere  at hom in oure dortour
I dar wel seyn  that or half an houre
Aftir his deeth  I saw him born to blisse
In myn auysione  so god me wysse
So dide oure sexteyn  and oure ffermerer
That han ben trewe freres  fifty ȝere
They moun now  god by thanked of his loue
Maken here Iubilee  and walken allone
And vp I roos  and al our couent eke
With many a teer  trillynge on my cheke
Withouten noyse  and clateryng of belles
Te Deum  was oure song  and nothyng elles
Saue that to Crist  I bad an orison
Thankynge him  of my reuelacion
ffor sire and dame  trosteth me right wele
Oure orisons ben more  effectuele
And more we sen  of Cristes secree thynges
Than borel folk  although that they ben kynges
We lyue in pouert  and in abstinence
And borel folk  in rychesse and in despence
Of mete and drynk  and in here foule delyt
We han this worldlis list  al in despyt
Laȝar and Dyues  lyueden dyuersly
And dyuers guerdoun  hadden therby
Who so wol preye  he must fast and be clene
And fatte his soule  and make his body leene


We fare as seith the Appostel  cloth and food
Suffiseth vs  though they be nat ful good
The clennesse and the fastynge  of vs ffreres
Maketh that Crist  accepteth oure preyeres
loo Moyses  fourty dayes and fourty nyght
ffasted  er that god ful of myght
Spak with him  in the mounte of Synay  
With empty wombe  of fastynge many a day
Receyued he the lawe  that was wryten
With goddes fynger  and Ely wel ȝe wyten
In Monte Oreb  or he had any speche
With heye god  that is oure lyues leche
he fasted longe  and was in contemplaunce
Aron that had  the temple in gouernaunce
And eke the othere prestis  euerychone
Into the temple  whan they shuld gone
To preyen for the peeple  and do seruyse
They nolde drynken  in no maner wyse
No drynk  which that myght hem dronken make
But there in abstinence  preye and wake
leest that they dedyn take hede  what I seye
But they be sobre  that for the peeple preye
War that  I sey no more  for it suffiseth
Oure lord ihesu  as holy wryt deuyseth
Ȝaf vs ensaumple  of fastynge and preyeres
Therfore we mendyuauntȝ  we sely freres
Ben wedded to pouert  and to contynence
To charite humblesse  and Abstinence
To persecucione  for rightwysnesse
To wepynge  misericorde  and clennesse
And therfore moun ȝe se  that oure preyeres
I speke of vs  we mendyuauntȝ  we freres
Ben to the heye god  more acceptable
Than ȝoures  with ȝoure feestes  at the table
ffro Paradys first  if I shal nat lye
Was man out chased  for his glotonye


And chast was man  in paradys certeyne
But herkene now Thomas  that I shal seyne
I haue no text of it  as I suppose
But I shal fynde  in a maner glose
That specially  oure swete lord Ihesus
Spak this by freres  whan he seide thus
Blissed be they  that poere in spirit bene
And so forth  al the gospel  may ȝe sene
Wheither it be lykere  oure professione
Or heres  that swymmen  in possessione
ffy on hire pompe  and on here glotonye
And of here lewednesse  I hem diffye
Me thynketh they ben lyke  to Iouynyan
ffat as a whale  and walken as a swan
Al vynolent  as a botle in the spence
here preyere is  ful greet reuerence
Whan they for soules  seyn the psalme of Dauyd  
loo buf they seyn  Cor meum eructauit
Who folweth Cristes gospel  and here fore
But we that humble ben  and chaast and poore
Werkers of goddis word  nat auditours
Therfore right as an hauke  vpon a sours
vp spryngeth into the Eyr  right so preyeres
Of charitable and chaast  bisy freres
Maken here sours  to goddis Eres twoo
Thomas Thomas  so mot I ride or goo
And be that lord  that cleped is seynt Iue
Nere thow oure brother  shuldest þou neuere thryue
In oure chapitre  preye we day and nyght
To Crist  that he sende the  hele and myght
Thy body  for to welden hastily
God wot quod he  no thyng therof fele I
As helpe me god  as I in fewe ȝeres
haue spended  vpon many dyuers freres
fful many a pound  ȝet fare I neuere the bette
Certeyn my good  haue I almost bysette


ffarewel my gold  for it is al ago
The frere answered  o Thomas dost þou so
What nedeth the  dyuerse freres seche
What nedeth him  that hath a parfyt leche
To sechen othere leches  in tovne
Ȝoure inconstaunce  is ȝoure confusione
holde ȝe thanne me  and eke al oure couent
To preye for ȝow  be insufficient
Thomas that iape  is nat worth a myte
Ȝoure maladye is  for we han to lyte
A  ȝeue that Couent foure and twenty grotes
A  ȝeue that Couent  half a quarter Otes
A  ȝeue that ffrere  a peny and lat him goo
Nay nay Thomas  it may no thyng be soo
What is a ferthyng  worth  parted on twelue
Loo  ech thyng that is oned  in him selue
Is more strong  than whan it is Iskatered
Thomas of me  thow shalt nat ben Iflatered
Thow woldest han oure labour  half for nought
The heye god  that al this world hath wrought
Seith that the werkman  is worth his hyre
Thomas nat of ȝoure tresore  I desire
As for my selue  but that al oure Couent
To preye for ȝow  ben ay so diligent
And for to holden  Cristes owen chirche
Thomas if ȝe wyln lerne  for to werche
Of beldynge  vpon chirches  may ȝe fynde
If it be good  in Thomas lyf of Ynde  
Ȝe lyn here ful of anger  and of Ire
With which the deuele  setteth ȝoure hert afyre
And chiden heere  the sely Innocent
Ȝoure wyf  that is so meke and pacient
And therfore Thomas  trowe me if þou lest
Ne stryue nat with thy wyf  as for the best
And bere this word awey  now be thy feyth
Touchyng swich thyng  lo what the wyseman seith


WithInne thyn hous  ne be þou no lyon
To thyne suggettȝ  do non oppression
Ne make thyn acqueyntaunce  nat to flee
And Thomas  ȝet eftsones charge I the
Be war from hire  that in thy bosom slepeth
War froo the serpent  that so slyly crepeth
vnder the gras  and styngeth sotilly
Be war my sone  and herkene paciently
That twenty thousand men  han lost here lyues
ffor stryuyng with here lemmans  and here wyues
Now syn ȝe han  so holy meeke a wyf
What nedeth ȝow  Thomas to maken strif
Ther nys Iwysse  no serpent so cruelle
Whan a man tret vpon his tail  ne half so felle
As womman is  whan she hath caught an Ire
vengeaunce is thanne  al that they desire
Ire is a synne on  of the greete of seuene
Abhominable  to the god of heuene
And to him self  it is destruccione
This euery lewed vyker  or Persone
Gan seyn  how Ire  engendreth homycide
Ire is in soth  executour of pryde
I coude of Ire  seyn so mechil sorwe
My tale shuld laste  til tomorwe
And þerfore preye I god  bothe day and nyght
An Irous man  god sende him litel myght
It is gret harm  and certes greet pitee
To sette an Irous man  in heye degree
 Whilom there was  an Irous potestate
As seith Senek  that duryng his estate
vpon a day  out redyn knyghtes twoo
And as fortune wolde  that it was so
That oon of hem cam hom  that othir nought
Anoon the knyght  byfore the Iuge is brought
That seide thus  thow hast thy felawe slayne
ffor which I deme the  to the deth certayne


And to another knyght  comaunded he
Go lede him to the deth  I charge the  
And happed as they wenten  by the weye
Toward the place  there he shuld deye
The knyght cam  which þat men wenden  had ben ded
Than thoughten they  it were the best red
To lede hem bothe  to the Iuge ageyne
They seiden lord  the knyght ne hath nat slayne
his felawe  heere he stant  hool alyue
 Ȝe shuln be deede quod he  so mote I thryue
This is to seyn  bothe on two and three
And to the first knyght  right thus spak he
I dampned the  thow must algate be deed
And thow also  must nedes lese thyn hed
ffor thow art cause  why thy felawe dyeth
And to the thridde knyght  right thus he seith
Thow hast nat do  that I comaunded the
And thus he dide  do slee hem alle three
 Irrous Cambises  was thus eke dronkelewe
And ay delited him  to ben a shrewe
And so byfel  a lord of his meyne
That loued vertuous  moralite
Seide on a day  betwix hem two right thus
A lord is lost  if he be vicious
And dronkenesse eke  is a foul recorde
Of any man  and namely in a lorde
There is ful many an eye  and many an ere
Awaytynge on a man  he wot nat where
ffor goddis loue  drynketh more attemprely
Wyn maketh a man  to leese wrecchedly
hys mynde  and eke hise lymes euerychone
 The reuers shalt thow se  quod he anone
And preeue it  be thyn owen experience
That wyn ne doth to folk no swich offence
There is no wyn  byreueth me my myght
Of hond ne foot  ne of myn eyen sight


And for despyt  he drank ful mechel more
An hundred part  than he had don byfore
And right anon  this Irrous cursed wrecche
This knyghtis sone  let byfore him fecche
Comaundynge him  he shulde byfore him stonde
And sodeynly  he tok his bowe in honde
And vp the stryng  he pulleth to his Ere
And with an arwe  he slow the child right there
Now wheither haue I  a syker hand or noone
Quod he  is al my myght  and mynde agone
hath wyn byreued me  myn eyen sight
What shulde I telle  the answere of the knyght  
His sone was slayn  there nys no more to seye
By war therfore  with lordes how ȝe pleye
Syngeth Placebo  and I shal if I can
But if it be  vnto a pore man
To a pore man  men shulde hise vices telle
But nat to a lord  though he shulde go to helle
 loo  Irrous Cirus  thilk percien
How destroyed he  the ryuer of Gysen
ffor that an hors of his  was dreynt thereInne
Whan that he went  Babylon to wynne
he made that the Ryuer  was so smal
That wommen myght  wade it oueral
lo  what seide he  that so wel teche can
Ne be no felawe  to non Irous man
Ne with no wood man  walke by the weye
lest the repente  I wol no forthere seye
Now Thomas leue brother  leeue thyn Ire
Thow shalt me fynde  as Iust as is a squire
holde nat the deuelis knyf  ay at thyn herte
Thyn anger doth the  al to sore smerte
But shewe to me  al thyn confessione
Nay quod this seke man  be seynt Symon
I haue ben shreue this day  at myn curat
I haue him told  holly al myn estat


It nedeth no more  to speke of it seith he
But if me liste  of myn humylitee
 Ȝeue me thanne of thy good  to make oure cloistre
Quod he  for many a muscle and many an Oistre
Whan other men  han ben ful wel at eese
hath ben oure fode  our cloistre for to reise
And ȝet god woot  vnethe the fundament
Parfourmed is  ne of oure pauement
Is nat a tyle ȝet  withInne oure wones
By god we owen  fourty pound for stones
Now help Thomas  for him þat harwed helle
Or elles mote we  oure bookes selle
And if þou lakke  oure predicacion
Than goth the world  al to destruccion
ffor who so fro this world  wold vs byreue
So god me saue Thomas  be ȝoure leeue
he wold byreue  out of this world the Sonne
ffor who can teche and worken  as we conne
And that is nat  of lytel tyme quod he
But sithe Ely was  and Helysee

In charitee  Ithanked be oure lorde
Now Thomas help  for seynt charitee  
And doun anoon  he sette him on his knee
 This syke man  wex ny wood  for Ire
he wolde that the frere  had ben afire
With his fals  dissimulacione
Swich thyng as is  in myn possessione
Quod he  that may I ȝeue ȝow and noon other
Ȝe seye me thus  how that I am ȝoure brother
 Ȝa certes quod the frere  trosteth wel
I toke oure dame  the lettre of oure seal
 Now wel quod he  and sumwhat shal I ȝeue
vnto ȝoure Holy Couent  whil I lyue
And in thyn hand  þou shalt it han anoone
On this condicione  and other noone


That þou departe it  so  my dere brother
That euery frere  haue as meche as other
Thus shalt þou swere  on thy professione
Withouten fraude  or cauellacione
 I swere it quod the frere  vpon my feith
And therwithal  his hond in his he leith
loo heere my feith  in me shal be no lak
 Thanne put thyn hand  adoun right be my bak
Seide this man  and grope wel behynde
Bynethe my buttok  there shalt þou fynde
A thyng that I haue  hid  in preuytee
 A thought this frere  that shal go with me
And doun his hand  he launched to the clift
In hope  for to fynde there  a ȝift
 And whan this syke man  felt this frere
Aboute his towel  gropen heere and there
Amydde his hand  he leet the frere a fart
There is no capel  drawyng in a cart
That myght han leet a fart  of swich a soun
 The frere vp stirt  as doth a wood lyon
A fals cherl quod he  for goddis bones
This hast þou for despyt  don for the nones
Thow shalt abye  this fart if I may
his meyne  which  þat herden swich a fray
Comen lepyng In  and chased out the frere
And forth he goth  with a ful angry chere
And fette his felawe  there as lay his stoor
he loked as he were  a wylde Boor
And grynt with the teth  so was he wroth
A sturdy paas  doun to the courte he goth
Where as there woned  a man of gret honour
To whom that he was  alwey confessour
This worthy man  was lord of that village  
This frere cam  as he were in a rage
Where as this lord  sat etyng at his bord
vnethe myght the frere  speke a word


Til at the laste  he seide god ȝow se
This lord gan loke  and seide benedicite
What frere Iohn  what maner world is this
I se wel that sum thyng  there is amys
Ȝe loken as the wode  were ful of theues
Sitte doun anoon  and telle me  what ȝoure gref is
And it shal ben amended  if I may
I haue quod he had  a despyt today
God ȝelde it ȝow  adoun in ȝoure village
That in this world  there nys so poere a page
That he nold han  abhominacion
Of that I haue resseyued  in the toun
And ȝet ne greueth it me  half so sore
As that the olde charl  with lokkes hore
Blasfemed hath  oure holy couent eke
 Now Maister quod this lord  I ȝow byseke
No Maister sire quod he  but seruytour
Though I haue had  in scole that Honour
God lyketh nat  that Raby men vs calle
Neither in market  ne in ȝoure large halle
No fors quod he  but telle me al ȝoure greef
Sire quod this frere  an odious meschef
This day betid is  myn order and me
And so par consquens  in ich degree
Of holy chirche  god amende it sone
Sire quod the lord  ȝe wot what is to done
Distempre ȝow nat  ȝe be my confessour
Ȝe be the salt of the erthe  and the sauour
ffor goddes loue  ȝour pacience now holde
Telle me ȝoure greef  and he anoon him tolde
As ȝe han herd byforn  ȝe wot wel what
The lady of the hous  ay stille sat
Til she had herd  what the frere seide
Ey goddis moder quod she  blisseful mayde
Is there ought elles  telle me feithfully
Madame quod he  how thynketh ȝow therby

I seye a cherl  hath doon a cherles dede
What shulde I sey  god late him neuere thee

Madame quod he  by god I shal nat lye
But I on other wyse  may be wreke  
I shal deffame him  ouer al where I speke
The fals blasfemour  that charged me
To parte  that wyl nat  departed be
To euery man Iliche  with meschaunce
The lord sat stille  as he were in a traunce
And in his herte  he rolleth vp and doun
how that this cherl had  ymaginacioun
To shewe swich a probleme  to the frere
Neuere erst er now  ne herd I swich matere
I trowe the deuele  put it in his mynde
In ars metryk  shal there no man fynde
Byforn this day  of swich a question
Who shulde make  a demonstracion
That euery man  shuld han lyke his part
As of a soun  or of a sauour of a fart
O nyce proud cherl  I shrewe his face
lo sires quod the lord  with harde grace
Who euere herde  of swich a thyng or now
To euery man Ilyke  telleth me how
It is an impossible  it may nat be
Ey nyce cherl  god late him neuere the
The rumblynge of a fart  and euery soune
Nis but of eyre  reuerberacione
And there it wasteth  litel and litel awey
There nys no man  can deme be my fey
If that it were  departed equally
What lo my cherl  lo ȝet how shrewedly
vnto my confessour  today he spak
I holde him certeyn  a demonyak


Now ete ȝoure mete  and late the cherl go pleye
lat him go hange him self  a deuel weye
 Now stod the lordes squyer  at his bord
That carf his mete  and herd word by word
Of al this thyng  of which I haue ȝow seyde
My lord quod he  be ȝe nat euele apaide

To ȝow sire frere  so ȝe be nat wroth
how that this fart  shulde euene deled be
Amonge ȝoure Couent  if it lyked me
Telle quod the lord  and thow shalt haue anoon
A govne cloth  by god and by Seynt Iohn
My lord quod he  whan that the wedir is fayre
Withoutyn wynd  or pertourbyng of eyre

But loke that it haue  his spokes alle
Twelue spokes hath a cart whel  comounly
And brynge me þanne twelue freres  wete ȝe why

Than shuln they knele adoun  by oon assent
And to euery spokes ende  in this manere
fful sadly leyn his nose  shal a frere
Ȝoure noble confessour  there god him saue
Shal holde his nose vpright  vnder the naue
Than shal this cherl  with bely stif and tought
As any tabour  hedir ben Ibrought
And sette him on the whel  right of this cart
vpon the naue  and make him late a fart
And ȝe shuln sen  vp perill of my lif
By preeue  which that is  demonstratif


That equally  the sovne of it  wyl wende
Ad eke the stynk  vnto the spokes ende
Saue that this worthy man  ȝoure confessour
Bycause he is a man  of gret Honour
Shal han the first fruyt  as reson is
The noble vsage of freres  ȝet is this
The worthy men of hem  shuln first be serued
And certeynly  he hath it wel deserued
he hath today taught vs  so mechil good
With prechynge in the pulpyt  there he stod
That I may vouchesaf  I seye for me
he had the first smel  of fartes three
And so wold al his Couent  hardily
he bereth him so fayre  and so holily
 The lord the lady  and eche man saue the frere
Seyden that Iankyn  spak in this matere
As wel as Euclide  or protholome
Towchynge the cherles  they seyden sotiltee
An hey wyt  made him speke  as he spak
he nys no fool  ne noo demonyak
And Iankyn hath Iwonne  a newe Govne
My Tale is doon  we ben almost at Tovne
Sire Clerk of Oxenford  oure Host sayde  
Ȝe ride as stille and coy  as dooth a mayde
Were newe spoused  syttynge at the bord
This day ne herd I  of ȝoure tonge a word
I trowe ȝe studye  abouten som Sophyme
But Salamon seith  þat euery thyng hath tyme
For goddis sake  as beth of betre cheere
It is no tyme  for to studyen heere
Telle vs som mery tale  be ȝoure feye
For what man  that is entred  in a pleye
He nedes must  vnto the pley assent
But preecheth nat  as freres don in lent
To maks vs  for oure olde synnes wepe
Ne that thy tale  make vs nat to slepe
Telle vs sum mery thyng  of auentures
Ȝoure termes  ȝoure coloures  and figures
Kepe hem in stoor  til so be  þat ȝe endite
Heye stile  as whan þat men  to kynges wryte
Spekith so pleyn  at this tyme  we ȝow preye
That we moun vnderstonde  what that ȝe seye
 This worthy Clerk  benygnely answered
Host quod he  I am vnder ȝoure ȝerde
Ȝe han of vs  as now  the gouernaunce
And therfore wold I do ȝow  obeisaunce


As fer as reson axeth  hardily
I wold ȝow telle a tale  which that I
lerned at Padowe  of a worthy Clerk
As proued be his wordes  and his werk
he is now deed  and nayled in his cheste
I preye to god  so ȝeue his soule reste
Fraunceys Petrak  the laureat poete
hyght this Clerk  whos Retoryk swete
Enlumyned al Itaille  of Poetrye
As lynyan dide  of Philosophye
Or lawe  or other art particuler
But deth that wol nat  suffren vs  dwellen heer
But as it were  a twynkelynge of an eye
hem bothe hath slayne  and alle shuln we deye
But forth to tellen  of this worthy man
That taught me this tale  as I began
I seye  that first  he with heye stile enditeth
Or he the dety  of his tale wryteth
A probleme  in the whiche  descryueth he
Pemond and of Saluces  the contree
And spekith of Appenym  the hilles heye
That ben the boundes  of westlumbardye
And of Mount vesulus  in speciale
Where as the Poo  out of a welle smalle
Taketh his first spryngynge  and his sours  
That Estward ay  encresith in his cours
To Emelie ward  To fferaro and venyse
The which a long thyng were  to deuyse
And trewely  as to my Iugement
Me thynketh it a thyng  impartinent
Saue he wole conueyen  his matere
But this is the tale  which þat ȝe moun heere
There is right at the west side  of ytaille
Doun at the rote  of vesulus the colde
A lusty pleyn  habundaunt of vytaille
Where many a Toun and Tour  þou mayst byholde
That founded were  in tyme of fadres olde
And many another  delitable syght
And Saluces  this noble contree hyght
 A Markys whylom  lord was of that londe
As were his worthy elderes  him byfore
And obeissant  ay redy to his honde
Were alle hise lieges  bothe lesse and more
Thus in delyt he lyueth  and hath doon ȝore
Byloued and dred  thurgh fauour of fortune
Bothe of his lordes  and of his Comune
 Therewith he was  to speken of lynage
The gentillest Iborn  of lumbardye
A fair persone and strong  and ȝong of age
And ful of honour  and curteysye
Discret Inow  his contree for to gye
Saue in somme thynges  he was to blame
And Walter  was this ȝong lordes name
 I blame him thus  that he considered nought
In tyme comyng  what myght him betyde
But on his lust present  was al his thought
As for to hauke and hunte  on euery syde
Wel ny  alle othere cures  leet he slide
And eke he nolde  and that was werst of alle
Wedde no wyf  for nought that myght byfalle


 Only that poynt  his peeple bar so sore
That flokmele on a day  to him they went
And oon of hem  that wysest was of lore
Or elles  that the lord best  wolde assent
That he shulde telle him  what the peeple ment
Or elles coude he shewe wel  swich mateer
he to the Markys seyde  as ȝe shuln heere
 O noble Markys  ȝoure humanyte  
Assureth vs  and ȝeueth vs hardynesse
As ofte  as tyme is  of necessite
That we to ȝow mow telle  oure heuynesse
Accepteth lord  thanne of ȝoure gentilnesse
That if we  with pytous hert  vnto ȝow pleyne
And lete ȝoure Eeres  nat my voys desdeyne
 Al haue I nat to done  in this matere
More than another man  hath in this place
Ȝet forasmeche  as ȝe  my lord so deere
han alwey shewed me  fauour and grace
I dar the betre  aske of ȝow a space
Of audience  to shewen oure request
And ȝe my lord  to don right as ȝow list
 For certes lord  so wel vs lyketh ȝow
And alle ȝoure werke  and euere han don  that we
Ne coude nat  oure self  deuysen how
We myghten lyuen  in more felicite
Saue o thyng lord  if it ȝowre wylle be
That for to be  a wedded man  ȝow list
Than were ȝoure peeple  in souerayne hertis rest
 Boweth ȝoure nekke  vnder that blisseful ȝok
Of Souereyntee  nought of seruyse
Which that men clepen  spousaile or wedlak
And thynketh lord  among ȝoure thoughtes wyse


how that oure dayes  passe in sondry gyse
For though we slepe or wake  or rome or ryde
Ay fleeth the tyme  it wyl no man abyde
 And though ȝoure grene ȝouthe  floure as ȝet
In crepeth age alwey  as stille as ston
And deth manaceth euere age  and smyt
In ech estate  for there eskapeth noon
And also certeyn  as we knowen echon
That we shuln deye  and vncerteyne we alle
Ben of that day  whan deth shal on vs falle
 Accepteth thanne of vs  the trewe entent
That neuere ȝet  refuseden ȝoure heeste
And we wyln lord  if that ȝe wyln assent
Chese ȝow a wyf  in short tyme at the leste
Born of the gentillest  and of the meste
Of al this lond  so that it ought seme
honour to god and ȝow  as we can deme
 Delyuere vs out  of al this besi drede
And take a wyf  for heye goddis sake
For if it so byfel  as god forbede
That thurgh ȝoure deth  ȝoure lynage shuld slake
And that a straunge successour  shuld take
Ȝoure heritage  O woo were vs on lyue  
Wherfore we preye ȝow  hastily to wyue
 Here meke preyere  and here pytous chere
Made the Markys hert  hane pytee
Ȝe wyln quod he  myn owen peeple deere
To that I neuere erst thought  streyne me
I me reioysed  of my liberte
That selde tyme  is founde in mariage
Ther I was free  I must ben in seruage


 But nathelees  I see ȝoure trewe entent
And troste vpon ȝoure wyt  and haue don ay
Wherfore of my free wyl  I wol assent
To wedde me  as sone as euere I may
But there as ȝe han  profred me today
To chese me a wyf  I ȝow relesse
That choys  and prey ȝow  of that profre cese
 For god it wot  that children often been
Vnlyke  here worthy elders  hem byfore
Bounte cometh al of god  nat of the streen
Of which  they ben Igendred  and Ibore
I troste in goddis bounte  and therfore
My mariage  and myn estat and reste
I hym bytake  he may do as him leste
 lat me alone  in chesyng of my wyf
That charge vpon my bak  I wol endure
But I ȝow preye and charge  vpon ȝoure lyf
That what wyf that I take  ȝe me assure
To worshipe hire  whyle that hire lyf may dure
In word and werk  bothe heere and euerywhere
As she an Emperoures doughter  were
 And forthermore  this shuln ȝe swere  that ȝe
Ageyn my choys  shuln neuere grucche ne stryue
For syn I shal forgo  my libertee
At ȝoure request  as euere mot I thryue
There as myn hert is sette  there wol I wyue
And but ȝe wyln assent  in swich manere
I preye ȝow  speketh no more  of this matere
 With hertly wyl  they sworn and assenten
To al this thyng  there seide no wyght nay
Bysekyng him of grace  or þat they wenten
That he wolde graunte hem  a certeyn day


Of his spousaille  as sone as euere he may
ffor ȝet alwey  the peeple sumwhat dredde
lest that the Markys  no wyf wold wedde
 he graunted hem a day  swich as him list
On which he wolde  be wedded sekerly
And seide  he dide al this  at here request  
And they with humble entent  ful buxumly
Knelyng vpoon here knees  ful reuerently
hym thanken alle  and thus they han an ende
Of here entent  and hom ageyn they wende
 And heerevpon  he vnto hise officers
Comaundeth  for the feest to purueye
And to his pryue knightis  and Squyers
Swich charge ȝaf  as him list on hem leye
And they  to his comaundement  obeye
And ech of hem dooth  al his diligence
To don vnto the feest  reuerence
Nought fer  fro thilke paleys  honurable
Whereas the Markys  shop his mariage
There stod a Thrope  of syght delitable
In which  that poore folk  of that village
hadden here beestes  and here herbergage
And of here labour  token here sustenaunce
After that the erthe  ȝaf hem habundaunce
 Amonges theise poore folk  there dwelt a man
Which that was holden  poorest of hem alle
But heye god  somtyme sende can
his grace  into a litel Oxes stalle
Ianycola  men of that Throp him calle
A doughter had he  fair Inow to sight
And Grysildes  this ȝonge mayden hight


 But for to speke  of vertuous beaute
Than was she oon  of the fayrest vnder Sonne
fful poorely  Ifostred vp  was she
No lykerous lust  was in hire hert Ironne
Wel oftere of the welle  than of the Tonne
She dranke  and for she wolde vertu plese
She knew wel labour  but noon Idel eese
 But though this Mayde  tendre were of age
Ȝet in the breest  of hire virgynytee
There was enclosed  ripe and sad corage
And in gret reuerence  and charitee
hire olde poore fader  fostred she
A fewe shepe  spynnyng on the feld  she kepte
She wolde nought  ben Idel  til she slepte
 And whan she homward cam  she wolde brynge
Wortes  or other Erbes  tymes ofte
The which she shredde  and seth for here lyuynge
And mad hire bed ful hard  and no thyng softe
And ay she kepte  hire fadres lyf on lofte
with euery obeisaunce  and diligence
That child may don  to fadres reuerence
 Vpon Grisilde  this poore creature  
fful often sithes  this Markys sette his eye
As he on huntyng rod  perauenture
And whan it fel  that he myght hire aspye
he nought  with wantoun lokyng  of folye
his eyen cast on hire  but in sad wyse
vpon hir chere  he wold him oft avyse
 Commendynge in his hert  hire wommanhede
And eke hire vertue  passyng any wyght
Of so ȝonge age  as wel in cheer as dede
ffor though the peeple  haue no gret insyght


In vertue  he considered ful right
hire bounte  and disposed that he wolde
wedde hire oonly  if euere he wedde shulde
 The day of weddynge cam  but no wyght can
Telle what womman  that it shulde be
ffor which meruayle  wondreth many a man
And seyden  whan they weren  in preuyte
wyl nat oure lord  ȝet leuen his vanyte
wyl he nat wedde  allas allas the whyle
why wyl he thus  hym self  and vs begyle
 But nathelees this Markys  hath don make
Of gemmes  sette in gold  and in Asure
Broches and rynges  for Grisildes sake
And of hire clothynge  toke he the mesure
Of a mayden  lyke  vnto hire stature
And eke of othere  ornamentis alle
That vnto swich a weddynge  shulde falle
 The tyme of vnderne  of the same day
Approcheth  that this weddynge  shulde be
And al the paleys  put was in aray
Bothe halle and chaumbres  eche in his degree
houses of office  stuffed with plentee
There maist þou se  of deynteuous vetaille
That may be founde  as fer as lasteth ytaille
 This ryal Markys  richely arayed
lordes and ladyes  in his companye
The which  vnto the feest  were Ipreyed
And of his retenue  the bachelerye
With many a soun  of sondry melodye
vnto the village  of the which I tolde
In this array  the right weye they holde


 Grisilde of this  god wot ful Innocent
That for hire shapen was  al this array
To fecchen water  at a welle is went
And cometh hom  as sone as euere she may  
For wel she had herd sey  that thilke day
The Markys shuld wedde  and if she myght
She wolde fayn han sen  som of that sight
 She thought I wyl  with othere Maydenes stonde
That ben myne felawes  in oure dore and se
The Markysesse  and therfore wol I fonde
To do at hom  as sone as it may be
The labour  which that longeth vnto me
And thanne I may  at leyser hire byholde
If she this weye  vnto the Castel holde
 And as she wolde  ouer the threswold gon
The Markys cam  and gan hire for to calle
And she sette doun  hire watir pot anoon
Beside the threswold  in an oxes stalle
And doun vpon hire knees  she gan to falle
And with sad countenaunce  knelith stille
Til she had herd  what was the lordis wylle
 This thoughtful Markys  spak vnto this mayde
fful soberly  and seide in this manere
Where is ȝoure fader  Grisildis he seyde
And she with reuerence  in humble cheere
Answered  lord  he is al redy heere
And In she goth  withouten lengere lette
And to the Markys  she hire fader fette
 he by the hond  than toke this poore man
And seide thus  whan he him had asyde
Ianycula  I neyther may ne can
lengere the plesaunce  of myn hert hyde


If that thow vouchesaf  what so betyde
Thy doughter wol I take  er that I wende
As for my wyf  vnto hire lyues ende
 Thow louest me  that wot I wel certeyn
And art my feithful leige man  Ibore
And al that lyketh me  I dar wel seyn
It lyketh the  and specially therfore
Telle me that poynt  that I haue seid byfore
If that thow wylt  vnto that purpos drawe
To take me  as for thyn sone in lawe
 This sodeyn caas  the man astoyned so
That red he wex abaist  and al quakynge
he stod  vnethe seide he wordes moo
But oonly thus  lord quod he my wyllynge
Is as ȝe wole  ne aȝeyns ȝoure likynge
I wyl no thyng  myn owen lord so deere
Ryght as ȝow lyst  gouerneth this matere
 Ȝet wol I  quod this Markys softly  
That in thy chaumbre  I and thow and she
haue a colacione  and wost thow why
ffor I wol aske  if it hire wyl be
To be my wyf  and reule hire after me
And al this shal be don  in thy presence
I wol nat speke  out of thyn audyence
 And in the Chaumbre  while they were aboute
here tretee  which as ȝe shuln after heere
The peeple cam  into the hous withoute
And wondred hem  in how honest manere
Ententifly  she kept hire fader dere
But vtterly  Grisildis wondir myght
ffor neuere erst  ne saw she  swich a sight


 No wonder is  though that she were astoned
To se so gret a gest  come into that place
She neuere was  to swich gestes woned
ffor which she loked  with ful pale face
But shortly  forth  this matere for to chace
Theise arn the wordes  that the Markys seyde
To this benygne  verray feithful Mayde
 Grisilde he seide  ȝe shuln wel vnderstonde
It lyketh to ȝoure fader  and to me
That I ȝow wedde  and eke it may so stonde
As I suppose  ȝe wol that it so be
But this demaunde  aske I first quod he
That syn it shal be don  in hasty wyse
Wol ȝe assent  or ellis ȝow avyse
 I seye this  be ȝe redy with good hert
To al my lust  and that I freely may
As me best thynketh  do ȝow laughe or smert
And neuere ȝe to grucche it  nyght ne day
And eke whan I sey ȝa  ȝe sey nat nay
Neither be word  ne frounyng countenaunce
Swere this  and heere I swere oure alliaunce
 Wondrynge vpon this thyng  quakyng for drede
She seyde  lord  vndigne and vnworthy
Am I  to thilke honour  that ȝe me bede
But as ȝe wol ȝoure self  right so wol I
And heere I swere  that neuere wyllyngly
In werk ne thought  I nyl ȝow disobeye
ffor to be deed  though me were loth to deye
 This is Inow  Grisilde myn quod he
And forth he gooth  with a ful sobre cheer
Out at the dore  and after that cam she
And to the peeple he seide  in this manere


This is my wyf quod he  that stondeth heere
Honoureth hire  and loueth hire I preye  
Who so me loueth  there is no more to seye
 And for that no thyng  of hire olde gere
She shulde brynge  into his hous  he bad
That wommen shulde  dispoylen hire right there
Of which theise ladyes  weren no thyng glad
To handle hire clothes  whereInne she was clad
But nathelees  this mayden bright of hewe
ffro foot to hede  they clothed han al newe
 Hire heres they kemed  that leyn vntressed
fful rudely  and with here fyngeris smale
A corone on hire hede  they han Idressed
And sette hire ful  of Ouches grete and smale
Of hire array  what shulde I make a tale
vnethe the peeple hire knew  for hire fairnesse
Whan she transmeeuyd was  in swich richesse
 This Markys  hath hire spoused  with a rynge
Brought for the same cause  and thanne hire sette
vpon an hors  snow whyte  and wel aumblynge
And to his Paleys  er he lengere lette
With ioyeful peeple  that hire lad and mette
Conveyed hire  and thus the day they spende
In reuel  tyl the Sonne gan descende
 And shortly forth  this mater for to chace
I seye  that to this newe  Markysesse
God hath swich fauour sent hire  of his grace
That it ne semed nought  by lyknesse
That she was born and fed  in rudenesse
As in a Cote  or in an Oxes stalle
But norisshed  in an Emperoures halle


 To euery wyght  she wexen is so deere
And worshipful  that folk there she was bore
And from hire birthe  knewen hire ȝere by ȝere
vnethe trowed they  but durst han swore
That to Ianicle  of which I spak byfore
She doughter were  for as by coniecture
hem thought she was  another creature
 ffor though that euere  vertuous was she
She was encresed  in swich excellence
Of thewes goode  Isett in hey bounte
And so discreet  and fair of eloquence
So benygne  and so digne of reuerence
And coude so  the peeples hertes embrace
That ech hire loueth  that loked in hire face
 Nat oonly of Saluces  in the toun
Publisshed was  the bounte of hire name
But eke beside  in many a Region  
If on seith wel  another seith the same
So spredeth  of hire heye bounte  the fame
That men and wommen  as wel ȝonge as olde
Gon to Saluces  vpon hire to byholde
 Thus Walter lowely  nay but really
Wedded  with fortunat honestete
In goddis pees  lyueth ful esily
At hom  and grace Inow outward had he
And for he saw  that vnder lowe degree
Was often vertue hid  the peeple him helde
A prudent man  and that is sen ful selde
 Nat oonly this Grisildis  thurgh hire wytte
Coude al the feet  of wyfly humblenesse
But eke whan that the cass  requered ytte
The comune profyt  coude she redresse


There nas discord  rancour ne heuynesse
In al that lond  that she ne coude appese
And wysely brynge hem alle  in reste and ease
 Though that hire husbonde  absent were or noon
If gentil men  or othere of the contree
Weren wrothe  she wolde brynge hem at oon
So wyse  and ripe wordes  had she
And Iuggementȝ  of so grete equyte
That she from heuene  sent was  as men wende
Peeple to saue  and euery wrong to amende
 Nought longe tyme after  that this Grisilde
Was wedded  she a doughter hath Ibore
Al had hire leuere  han born a knaue childe
Glad was this Markys  and his folk therfore
ffor though a mayden child  come al byfore
She may vnto a knaue child  atteyne
Be lyklihede  syn she nys nat bareyne
 There fel  as it byfalleth tymes moo
Whan that this child  hath souked but a throwe
This Markys in his hert  longeth so
To tempte his wyf  hire sadnesse for to knowe
That he ne myght  out of his hert throwe
This merueillous desir  his wyf to assaye
Nathelees god wot  he thought hire for to affraye
 he had assayed hire  Inow byfore
And fond hire euere good  what nedeth it
hire for to tempte  and alwey more and more
But as for me I seye  that euyl it sitte
Though summe men preyse it  for a sotil wyt  
To assaye a wyf  whan that it is no nede
And putten hire  in angwyssh and in drede


 ffor which this Markys  wrought in this manere
he cam a nyght alone  there as she lay
With sterne face  and with ful trouble cheere
And seide thus  Grisilde quod he  that day
That I ȝow toke  out of ȝoure poore array
And putte ȝow in estat  of heigh noblesse
Ȝe han it nat forgeten  as I gesse
 I seye Grisilde  this present dignitee
In which that I haue put ȝow  as I trowe
Maketh ȝow nat  forgeteful for to be
That I ȝow toke  in poore estat  ful lowe
For any wele  ȝe mot ȝoure seluen knowe
Take hede  of euery word  that I ȝow seye
There nys no wyght  that herith it but we tweye
 Ȝe wot ȝoure self wel  how that ȝe cam heere
Into this hous  it is nat longe agoo
And though to me  that ȝe be leef and deere
Vnto my gentiles  ȝe be no thyng soo
They seyn to hem  it is gret shame and woo
For to be suggettes  and ben in seruage
To the  that born art  of a smal lynage
 And namely  sithe thy doughter was Ibore
Theise wordes han they spoken  doutelees
But I desire  as I haue don byfore
To lyue my lif with hem  in reste and pees
I may nat in this caas  be rechelees
I mot don with thy doughter  for the beste
Nat as I wolde  but as myne gentiles liste
 And ȝet god wot  this is ful loth to me
But nathelees  withouten ȝoure wetynge
I wyl nat don  but this wol I quod he
That ȝe to me assenten  as in this thynge


Shewe now ȝoure pacience  in ȝoure werkynge
That ȝe me hight  and swor in ȝoure village
That day that maked was  oure mariage
 Whan she had herd al this  she nought ameeued
Neither in word  chere ne countenaunce
For as it semed  she was nought agreued
She seide lord  al lith in ȝoure plesaunce
My child and I  with hertly obeysaunce
Ben ȝoures alle  and ȝe moun saue or spille
Ȝoure owen thyng  werketh after ȝoure wylle
 There may no thyng  so god my soule saue  
lykyng to ȝow  that may displese me
Ne I desire  no thyng for to haue
Ne drede for to lese  saue oonly ȝe
This wyl is in myn hert  and ay shal be
No lengthe of tyme  or deth  may this deface
Ne chaunge my corage  to another place
 Glad was this Markys  of hire answerynge
But ȝet he feyned  as he were nat so
Al drery was his chere  and his lokynge
Whan that he shulde  out of the chaumbre goo
Sone after this  a furlonge weye or twoo
he preuyly hath told  al his entente
Vnto a man  and to his wyf him sente
 A maner of a Sergeaunt  was this pryue man
The which he feithful  often founden had
In thynges greete  and eke swich folk wel can
Don execucion  on thynges badde
The lord knew wel  that he him loued and dradde
And whan this sergeaunt  knew his lordes wylle
Into the chaumbre  he stalketh him ful stille


 Madame he seide  ȝe mot forȝeue it me
Though I do thyng  to which I am constreyned
Ȝe ben so wys  that right wel knowen ȝe
That lordes hestes  moun nat ben feyned
They moun wel ben beweilled  or compleyned
But men must nedes  to here lust obeye
And so wol I  there nys no more to seye
 This child am I  comaunded for to take
And spak no more  but out the child he hent
Dispetously  and gan a cher make
As though he wolde  han slayn it  or he went
Grisildis mot al suffre  and al consent
And as a lomb  she sitteth meke and stille
And leet this cruel Sergeaunt  don his wille
 Suspecious was the diffame  of this man
Suspect his face  suspect his word also
Suspect the tyme  in which he this bygan
Allas hire doughter  that she loued so
She wende he wolde  han slayn it right thoo
But natheless  she neither wep ne syked
Conformynge hire  to that the Markys lyked
 But at the laste  to speken she bygan
And mekely she  to the sergeaunt preyede
So as he was  a worthy gentil man
That she must kysse hire child  er that it deyede
And in hire arm  this litel child she leyde
With ful sad face  and gan the child to blisse  
And lulled it  and after gan it kysse
 And thus she seide  in hire benygne vois
Fare wel my child  I shal the neuere se
But sithe I haue the marked  with the crois
Of thilke fader  Iblissed mot thow be


That for vs deyed  vpon a cros of tree
Thy soule litel child  I him betake
For this nyght  shalt þou dyen for my sake
 I trowe that to a Norice  in this caas
It had ben hard  this reuthe for to se
Wel myght a moder thanne  han cried allas
But nathelees  so sad and stedefast was she
That she endured  al aduersitee
And to the Sergeaunt  mekely she seyde
haue heere ageyn  ȝoure litel ȝong mayde
 Goth now quod she  and doth my my lordes heste
But o thyng wold I preye ȝow  of ȝoure grace
That but my lord  forbad ȝow at the leste
Berieth this litel body  in sum place
That beestes ne no briddes  it torace
But he no word  wolde to the purpos seye
But toke the child  and went vpon his weye
 This Sergeaunt cam  vnto his lord ageyn
And of Grisildis wordes  and of hire chere
he told him poynt for poynt  in short and pleyn
And him presenteth  with his doughter dere
Sumwhat this lord  hath reuthe in his manere
But nathelees  his purpos held he stille
As lordes don  whan they wyln han here wille
 And bad this Sergeaunt  that he preuyly
Shulde this child ful softe  wynde and wrappe
With alle the circumstaunceȝ  tenderly
And carie it in a coffre  or in a lappe
But vpon peyne  his hede of for to swappe
That no man shulde knowe  of this entent
Ne whens he cam  ne whider that he went


 But at Boloigne  to his Suster deere
That thilke tyme  of Pauyk was Contesse
he shuld it take  and shewe hire this matere
Bysekyng hire  to don hire besynesse
This child to fostren  in al gentilnesse
And whos child that it was  he bad hire hyde
From euery wyght  for ought that may betide
 The Sergeaunt goth  and hath fulfilled this thyng
But to the Markys  now retourne we
For now goth he  ful fast ymaginyng
If by his wyues chere  he myght se  
Or by hire word  aperceyue that she
Were chaunged  but he neuere coude hire fynde
But euere in oon  Ilyke  sad and kynde
 As glad as humble  as bysy in seruyce
And eke in loue  as she was wont to be
Was she to him  in euery maner wyse
Ne of hire doughter  nought a word spak she
Noon accident  for noon aduersite
Was seen in hire  ne neuere hire doughter name
Ne nempned she  in ernest ne in game
 In this estate  there passed ben foure ȝere
Er she with childe was  but as god wole
A knaue child she bar  be this wautere
fful gracious  and fair for to beholde
And whan that folk  it to his fader tolde
Nat oonly he  but al his contree merye
Was for this child  and god they thanke and herye
 Whan it was two ȝer olde  and fro the breste
Departid of his norice  vpon a day
This Markys caught ȝet  another lyste


To tempte his wyf  ȝet oftere if he may
O nedlees  was she tempted in assay
But wedded men  ne knowe no mesure
Whan that they fynde  a pacient creature
 Wyf quod this Markys  ȝe han herd or this
My peeple sekerly  beren oure mariage
And namely  sithen my sone  Iborn is
Now is it werse  than euere in al oure age
The murmur sleeth myn herte  and myn corage
For to myn Eres  cometh the voys so smerte
That it wol ny  destroyed hath myn herte
 Now sey they thus  whan wauter is agoon
Than shal the blode  of Ianicle succede
And be oure lord  for other han we noon
Swich wordes seyn my peeple  it is no drede
Wel ought I  of swich murmur  take hede
For certeynly  I drede  swich sentence
Though they nouȝt pleyne and speke  in myn audience
 I wolde lyue in pees  if that I myght
Wherfore  I am disposed  vtterly
As I his Suster  serued be nyght
Right so thynke I  to serue him preuyly
This warne I ȝow  for ȝe nat sodeynly
Out of ȝoure selue  for no woo shulde outraye
Beth pacient  and therof I ȝow preye  
 I haue quod she  seid thus  and euere shal
I wol no thyng  ne nyl no thyng certeyn
But as ȝow list  nought greueth me at al
Though that my doughter  and my sone be slayn
At ȝoure comaundement  that is to slayn
I haue nought had no part  of children tweyne
But first sykenesse  and after woo and peyne


 Ȝe be my lord  doth with ȝoure owyn thynge
Right as ȝow list  asketh no reed of me
For as I left at home  al my clothynge
Whan I first cam to ȝow  right so quod she
Lefte I my wylle  and my liberte
And toke ȝoure clothynge  wherfore I ȝow preye
Doth ȝoure plesaunce  I wol ȝoure lust obeye
 And certes if I had had  prescience
Ȝoure wyl to knowe  or ȝe ȝoure lust me tolde
I wold it don  withouten negligence
But now I wot ȝoure lust  and what ȝe wolde
Al ȝoure plesaunce  ferme and stable I holde
For wyst I  that my deth  myght do ȝow eese
Right gladly wold I deye  ȝow to please
 Deth may nat make  no comparisone
Vnto ȝoure loue  and whan this Markys say
The constaunce of his wyf  he cast adoune
hise eyen two  and wondreth that she may
In pacience suffre  al this array
And forth he goth  with drery countenaunce
But to his herte  it was right gret plesaunce
 This vgly Sergeaunt  in the same wyse
That he hire daughter caught  right so he
Or werse  if men can werse deuyse
hath hent hir sone  that ful was of beaute
And euere in oone  so pacient was she
That she no chere made  of heuynesse
But kyst hire sone  and after gan him blisse
 Saue this she preyed him  if that he myght
hire lytel sone  he wolde in erthe graue
hise tendre lymes  delicat to sight
ffro foules and fro bestes  for to saue


But she noon answere  of him myght haue
He went his wey  as him no thyng ne rought
But to Boloigne  he it tenderly brought
 This Markys wondreth  euere lengere the more
Vpon hire pacience  and if that he
Ne had sothly  knowen ther byfore
That parfytly  hire children loued she  
he wolde han wende  that of som sotiltee
And of malice  or for cruel corage
That she had suffred this  with sad visage
 But wel he knew  that next him self certeyn
She loued hire children best  in euery wyse
But now of wommen  wold I asken fayn
If theise assayes  myght nat suffise
What coude a sturdy husbonde  more deuyse
To preue hire wyfhode  and hire stedfastnesse
And he contynuynge  euere in sturdynesse
 But there be folk  of swich condicion
That whan they han  a certeyn purpos take
They conne nat stynt  of here entencion
But right as they were bounden  vnto a stake
They wyl nat  of that first purpos slake
Right so this Markys  fullich hath purposed
To tempte his wyf  as he was first disposed
 He wayteth  if by word  or countenaunce
That she to him  was chaunged of corage
But neuere coude he fynde  variaunce
She was ay oon  in hert and in visage
And ay the ferthere  that she was in age
The more trewe  if that it were possible
She was to him  in loue  and more penyble


 For which it semed thus  that of hem two
There nas but oo wyl  for as Walter lest
The same lust  was hire pleasaunce also
And god by thanked  as fel for the best
She shewed wel  for no worldly vnrest
A wyf as of hire self  no thyng ne shulde
Wyln in effect  but as hire husbonde wolde
 The sclaunder of Wautere  ofte and wyde sprad
That of cruel herte  he wykkedly
For he  a pore womman  wedded had
hath mordred  bothe hise children preuyly
Swich murmur  was among hem comounly
No wonder is  for to the peeples Ere
There cam no word  but that they mordred were
 For which  there as his peeple ther byfore
had loued him wel  the sclaunder of his defame
Mad hem  that they him hated therfore
To ben a mortherere  is an hateful name
But nathelees  for ernest or for game
he of his cruel purpos  nold he stynt
To tempte his wyf  was sette al his entent  
 Whan that his doughter  twelue ȝer was of age
he to the courte of Rome  in subtyl wyse
Enformed of his wyl  sent his message
Comaundyng hem  swich bulles to deuyse
As to his cruel purpos  may suffise
How that the Pope  as for his peeples reest
Bad him to wedde  another if him list
 I sey he bad  they shulde countrefete
The Popes bulles  makyng mencion
That he hath leue  his first wyf to lete
As by the Popes  dispensacion


To stynte rancour  and discencion
Betwix his peeple and him  thus seide the bulle
The which they han  publisshed at the fulle
 The rude peeple  as it no wondir is
Wende ful wele  that it had ben right so
But whanne theise tidynggis  comen to Grisildis
I deme  that hire herte  was ful woo
But she elyke sad  for euere moo
Disposid was  this humble creature
The aduersite of fortune  al to endure
 Abidyng euere his lust  and his plesaunce
To whom that she was ȝeuen  hert and al
As to hire verray worldly  suffisaunce
But shortly  if I this story  tellen shal
This Markys  wryten hath in special
A lettre  in which he sheweth  his entent
And secretly  he to Boloigne  it sent
 To the Erl of Pauyk  which that hadde tho
Wedded his Suster  preyed he specially
To bryngen hom ageyn  hise children two
In honurable estat  al openly
But oo thyng he him preyed  vtterly
That he to no wyght  though men wolde enquere
Shulde nat telle  whos children that they were
 But seyn that the mayden  shulde wedded be
Vnto the Markys  of Saluce anoon
And as this Erl was preyed  so dide he
For at the day sette  he on his wey is gon
And forth he rod  ful fast anoon
Toward Saluce  this Mayde for to gyde
hire ȝonge brother  ridyng hire besyde


 Arrayed was  toward hire mariage
This fressh May  ful of gemmes clere
Hire brother which  that Seuene ȝer was of age  
Arayed eke ful fressh  in his manere
And thus in gret noblesse  and with glad chere
Toward Saluces  shapyng here Iourney
Fro day to day  they ryden in here wey
 A mong al this  after his wykked vsage
This Markys  ȝet his wyf to tempte more
To the outrest preue  of hire corage
ffully  to haue  experience and lore
If that she were  as stedefast as byfore
he on a day  in open audience
fful boistously  hath seid hire  this sentence
 Certes Grisilde  I had Inow plesaunce
To haue ȝow to my wyf  for ȝoure goodnesse
As for ȝoure trouthe  and for ȝoure obeysaunce
Nought for ȝoure lynage  ne for ȝoure richesse
But now knowe I  in verray sothfastnesse
That in gret lordship  if I me wel auyse
There is gret seruitute  in sondry wyse
 I may nat do  as euery plowman may
My peeple constreyneth me  to take
Another wyf  and crien day be day
And eke the Pope  rancour  for to slake
Consenteth it  that dar I vndertake
And trewely  thus meche  I wyl ȝow sey
My newe wyf  is comyng by the wey
 Be strong of hert  and voide anoon hire place
And thilke dower  that ȝe broughten me
Take it ageyn  I graunt it of my grace


Returneth to ȝoure fadres hous  quod he
Noman may alwey  haue prosperite
With euen hert  I rede ȝow to endure
The stroke of fortune  or of auenture
 And she ageyn answered  in pacience
My lord quod she  I wot and wyst alwey
how that bytwene  ȝoure magnificence
And my pouerte  no wyght ne can ne may
Maken comparison  it is no nay
I ne held me neuere digne  in no manere
To be ȝoure wyf  ne ȝoure chaumbrere
 And in this hous  there ȝe me lady made
The heye god take I  for my wytnesse
And also wysly  he my soule glade
I neuere held me lady  ne maistresse
But humble seruaunt  to ȝoure worthynesse
And euere shal  while þat my lyf may dure
Abouen euery  worldly creature  
 That ȝe so longe  of ȝoure benignite
han holden me  in honour and nobley
Where as I was  nought worthy for to be
That thanke I god  and ȝow  to whom I prey
fforȝelde it ȝow  there is no more to sey
Vnto my fader  gladly wol I wende
And with him dwelle  vnto my lyues ende
 There I was fostered  of a child ful smal
Til I be dede  my lyf there wol I lede
A wydewe clene  in body hert and al
And sithe I ȝaf to ȝow  my maydenhede
And am ȝoure trewe wyf  it is no drede
God shilde  swich a lordes wyf  to take
Another man  to husbonde or to make


 And of ȝoure newe wyf  god of his grace
So graunte ȝow welthe  and prosperite
ffor I wol gladly  ȝelden hire my place
In which that I was  blisful wont to be
For sithe it liketh ȝow  my lord quod she
That whilom weren  al myn hertis rest
That I shal gon  I wyl go whan ȝow list
 But there as ȝe me profre  swich doware
As I first brought  it is wel in my mynde
It were my wreched clothes  no thyng faire
The which to me  were hard now for to fynde
O goode god  how gentyl and how kynde
Ȝe semed by ȝoure speche  and ȝoure vysage
The day  that maked was  oure mariage
 But soth is seid  algate I fynde it trewe
For in effect  it preued is on me
loue is nought old  as whan that it is newe
But certes lord  for noon aduersitee
To deye in this cas  it shal nat be
That euere in word or werk  I shal repent
That I ȝow ȝaf myn hert  in hole entent
 My lord ȝe wot  that in my fadres place
Ȝe dide me stripe  out of my poore wede
And richely me elad  of ȝoure grace
To ȝow brought I nat ellis  out of drede
But filthe and nakednesse  and maydenhede
And heere ageyn  my clothyng I restore
And eke my weddyng ryng  for eueremore
 The remenaunt of ȝoure Ioweles  redy be
Withinne ȝoure chaumbre  I dar it safly seyn
Naked out of my fadres hous  quod she
I cam  and naked mot I turne ageyn  

Al ȝoure plesaunce  wold I folwe feyn
But ȝet I hope  it be nat ȝoure entent
That I smokles  out of ȝoure paleys went
 Ȝe coude nat do  so dishonest a thyng
That thilke wombe  in which ȝoure children ley
Shulde byforn the peeple  in my walkyng
Be seyn al bare  wherfore I ȝow prey
late me nat lyke a worme  go by the wey
Remembre ȝow  myn owen lord so dere
I was ȝoure wyf  though I vnworthy were
 Wherfore in guerdone  of my maydenhede
Which that I brought  and nought ageyn I bere
As vouchesaf  to ȝeue me to my mede
But swich a smok  as I was wont to were
That I therewith may wrye  the wombe of hire
That was ȝoure wyf  and here I take my leue
Of ȝow myn owen lord  leste I ȝow greue
 The smok quod he  that þou hast on thy bak
lat it be stille  and bere it forth with the
But wel vnethes  thilke word he spak
But went his wey  for reuthe and for pite
Byforn the folk  hire seluen stripeth she
And in hire smok  with foot and hede al bare
Toward hire fadres hous  forth is she fare
 The folk hire folwen  wepyng in here wey
And fortune ay  they cursen  as they gon
But she fro wepyng  kepeth hire eyen drey
Ne in this tyme  word ne spak she noon
hire fader  that this tidyng  herd anoon
Cursed the day  and tyme  that nature
Shop him to ben  a lyues creature


 For out of doute  this olde poore man
Was euere in suspect  of hire mariage
For euere he demed  sithe that it bygan
That whan the lord  fufilled had his corage
hym wolde thynke  it were a disperage
To his estate  so lowe for to light
And voyden hire  as sone as euere he myght
 Ageyns his doughter  hastily goth he
For he by noyse of folk  knew hire comyng
And with hire olde cote  as it myght be
he couered hire  ful sorwefully wepyng
But oon hire body  myght he it nat bring
For rude was the cloth  and she more of age
Be dayes feele  than at hire mariage  
 Thus with hire fader  for a certeyn space
Dwelleth this flour  of wyfly pacience
That neither by hire wordes  ne hire face
Byforn the folk  ne eke in here absence
Ne shewed she  that hire was don offence
Ne of hire heye estate  no remembraunce
Ne had she  as by hire countenaunce
 No wonder is  for in hire gret estate
hire goost was euere  in pleyn humylite
No tendre mouth  non hert delicate
No pompe  no semblaunt of ryalte
But ful of pacient benygnyte
Discrete  and prydles  ay honurable
And to hire husbond  ay meke and stable
 Men speken of Iob  and most for his humblesse
As clerkis whan hem list  konne wel endite
Namely of men  but as in sothfastnesse
Though Clerkis preyse wommen  but a lite


There can no man  in humblesse him aquyte
As women konne  ne konne be half so trewe
As wommen ben  but it be falle of newe
 Fro Boloigne  is this Erl of Pauyk come
Of which the fame  vp sprong  to more and lesse
And in the peeples Eres  alle and some
Was couth eke  that a newe markysesse
he with him brought  in swich pompe and richesse
That neuere was there seyn  with mannes eye
So noble aray  in al West lumbardye
 The Markys  which that shope  and knew al this
Er that this Erl was come  sent his message
For thilke sely  poore Grisildis
And she with humble hert  and glad visage
Nat with no swollen thought  in hire corage
Cam at his heste  and oon hir knees hire sette
And reuerently  and wysly she him grette
 Grisilde quod he  my wyl is outerly
This mayden  that shal wedded be to me
Resceyued be tomorwe  as ryally
As yt possible is  in myn hous to be
And eke that euery wyght  in his degree
haue his estate  in syttyng and in seruyse
And hey plesaunce  as I can best deuyse
 I haue no womman  sufficient certeyn
The chaumbres to araye  in ordinaunce
After my lust  and therfore wold I feyn  
That thyn were  al swich maner gouernaunce
Thow knowest eke  of olde al my plesaunce
Though thyn aray be badde  and euel beseye
Do thow thyn deuer  at the leste weye


 Nat oonly lord  that I am glad quod she
To do ȝoure lust  but I desire also
Ȝow for to serue  and pleese in my degree
Withouten feyntyng  and shal euere moo
Ne neuere for no wele  ne no woo
Ne shal the goost  withInne myn hert stynt
To loue ȝow best  with al myn trewe entent
 And with that word  she gan the hous to dight
And tables for to sette  and beddes make
And peyned hire  to don al that she myght
Preying the chaumbreres  for goddis sake
To hasten hem  and faste swepe and shake
And she the most  seruysable of alle
hath euery chaumbre arayed  and his halle
 Abouten the vnderne  gan this Erl alight
That with him brought  theise noble children twey
ffor which the peeple  ran to se the sight
Of here aray  so richely besey
And thanne at arst  amonges hem they sey
That Walter was no fool  though that him list
To chaunge his wyf  for it was for his best
 ffor she is feyrere  as they demen alle
Than is Grisilde  and more tendre of age
And fairere fruyt  bytwen hem shuld falle
And more plesaunt  for hire heigh lynage
hire brother eke  so fayr was of vysage
That hem to seen  the peeple hath caught plesaunce
Commendyng now  the Markys gouernaunce
 O stormy peeple  vnsad  and euere vntrewe
Ay vndiscret  and chaungyng as a fane
Delityng euere  in rumbul that is newe
ffor lyke the Mone  ay waxeth he and wane


Ay ful of clappyng  dere Inow a Iane
Ȝoure dome is fals  ȝoure constaunce euele preueth
A ful gret fool is he  that oon ȝow leueth
 Thus seiden sadde folk  in that Citee
Whan that the peeple  gased vp and doun
ffor they were glad  right for the nouelte
To han a newe lady  of here toun
No more of this  make I now mencion
But to Grisilde ageyn  I wol me dresse  
And telle hire constaunce  and hire besynesse
 fful besy was Grisilde  in euery thyng
That to the fest  was pertynent
Right nought was she abayst  of hire clothyng
Though it were rude  and somdele eke torent
But with glad chere  to the ȝate is she went
With othere folk  to grete the Markysesse
And after that  doth forth hire besynesse
 With so glad chere  hise gestes she resceyued
And so konyngly  euerich in his degree
That no defaute  no man perceyued
But ay they wondren  what she be
That in so poore aray  was for to se
And coude swich honour  and reuerence
And worthily they preisen  hire prudence
 In all this mene while  she ne stynt
This Mayde  and eke hire brother  to comende
With al hire herte  in ful benigne entent
So wel  that noman coude  hire pris amende
But at the last  whan that theise lordes wende
To setten hem doun to mete  he gan to calle
Grisilde  as she was besy  in the halle


 Grisilde quod he  as it were in his pley
how lyketh the my wyf  and hire beaute
Right wel quod she  my lord  for in good fey
A fairere saw I neuere noon  than she
I preye to god  ȝeue hire prosperite
And so hope I  that he wyl to ȝow send
Plesaunce I now  vn to ȝoure lyues end
 O thyng byseke I ȝow  and warne also
That ȝe ne pryke  with no turmentynge
This tendre Mayde  as ȝe han don moo
ffor she is fostred  in hire norisshynge
More tenderly  and to my supposynge
She coude nat  aduersite endure
As coude a poore  fostred creature
 And whan this Walter  saugh hire pacience
hire glad chere  and no malice at al
And he so oft  had don to hire offence
And she ay sad  and constaunt as a wal
Contenuyng euere  hire Innocence ouer al
This sturdy Markys  gan his hert dresse
To rewe vpoon hire wyfly  stedfastnesse
 This is Inow  Grisilde myn quod he
Be now nomore agast  ne euele apayd  
I haue thy feith  and thyn benygnytee
As wel as euere womman  was assayed
In gret astat  and poorely arrayed
Now knowe I deere wyf  thy stedfastnesse
And hire in armes toke  and gan hire kysse
 And she for wonder  toke of it no kepe
She herde nat  what thyng he to hire seyde
She ferd as she had stirt  out of a slepe
Tyl she  out of hire Masednesse  abreyde


Grisilde quod he  by god that for vs deyde
Thow art my wyf  noon other I haue
Ne neuere had  as god my soule saue
 This is thy doughter  which þou hast supposed
To be my wyf  that other feithfully
Shal be myn Eyr  as I haue ay disposed
Thow bar him  in thy body trewely
At Boloigne  haue I kept hem preuyly
Take hem ageyn  for now maist þou nat sey
That thow hast lorn  noone of þine children twey
 And folk that other wyse  han seyd on me
I warne hem wele  that I haue don this dede
ffor no malice  ne for no cruelte
But for to assaye  in the  thy wommanhede
And nat to slen myne children  god forbede
But for to kepen hem  preuyly and stille
Til I thy purpos knew  and al thy wylle
 Whan she this herd  on swouȝne doun she falleth
For pytous ioye  and aftir hire swownyng
She  bothe hire ȝonge children  vnto hire calleth
And in hire armes  pytously wepyng
Embracede hem  and tenderly kyssing
fful lyke a Moder  with her salte teres
She bathed bothe here visage  and here heres
 O which a pytous thyng  it was to se
hire swownyng  and hire humble voys to heere
Graunt mercy lord  god thanke it ȝow quod she
That ȝe han saued me  myne children dere
Now rekke I neuere  to be ded right heere
Sithe I stonde  in ȝoure loue  and in ȝoure grace
No force of deth  ne whan my spirit pace


 O tendre o dere  o ȝonge children myne
Ȝoure wooful Moder  wend stedfastly
That cruel houndes  or som foule venyme
had eten ȝow  but god of his mercy
And ȝoure benigne fader  tenderly  
hath don ȝow kepe  and in that same stounde
Al sodeynly  she fel adoun to grounde
 And in hire swough  so sadly holdeth she
hire children two  whan she gan hem embrace
That with gret sleight  and gret difficulte
The children  from hire arm  they gonne race
O many a teere  many a pytous pace
Doun ran of hem  that stoden hire beside
Vnethe aboute hire  myght they abyde
 Walter hire gladeth  and hire sorwe slaketh
Sche ryseth vp  abasshed  from hire traunce
And euery wyght  hire ioye  and feste maketh
Til she hath caught  ageyn  hire countenaunce
Walter hire doth  so feithful plesaunce
That it was deynte  for to se the chere
Bytwen hem two  syn they ben met in fere
 Theise ladyes  whan that they  here tyme sey
han taken hire  and into chaumbre gon
And stripen hire  out of hire rude aray
And in a cloth of gold  that bright shon
With a Corone  of many a riche ston
Vpon hire hede  they into halle hire brought
And there she was honoured  as hire ought
 Thus hath this pytous day  a blisful ende
ffor euery man and womman doth his myght
This day  in myrthe and reuel  to spende
Til on the walkene  shon the sterres light


ffor more solempne  in euery mannes sight
This feste was  and grettere of costage
Than was the reuel  of hire mariage
 fful many a ȝere  in heigh prosperitee
lyuen theise two  in concord and in reest
And richely his doughter  maryed he
Vnto a lord  oon of the worthiest
Of al Itayle  and thanne in pees and rest
his wyues fader  in his court he kepeth
Til that the soule  out of his body crepeth
 His sone succedith  in his heritage
In reste and pees  after his faderes day
And fortunat was eke  in mariage
Al put he nat his wyf  in gret assay
This world is nat so strong  it is no nay
As it hath ben  in olde tymes ȝore
And herkeneth  what this Auctor  seith therfore
 This storie is seid  nat for that wyues shulde  
ffolwe Grisilde  as in humilitee
ffor it were importable  though they wold
But for that euery wyght  in his degree
Shulde be constaunt  in aduersitee
As was Grisilde  therfore Petrak wryteth
This storie  which with heye stile  he endyteth
 ffor sithe a womman  was so pacient
Vnto a mortal man  wel more we ought
Resceyuen al in gree  that god vs sent
ffor gret skyl is  he preeue that he wrought
But he ne tempteth no man  that he bought
As seith Seynt Iame  if ȝe his pistel rede
he preeueth folk al day  it is no drede


 And suffreth vs  as for oure exercise
With sharpe skorges  and aduersitee
fful oft to be bete  in sondry wyse
Nat for to knowe  oure wyl  for certis he
Er we were born  knew al oure freeletee
And for oure best  is al his gouernaunce
lat vs thanne lyne  in vertuous suffraunce
 But oo word lordynggis  herkeneth or I go
It were ful hard  to fynde now a dayes
In al a Toun  Grisildis thre or twoo
ffor if þat thay were put  to swich assayes
The gold of hem  hath now so bad alayes
With bras  that though the coyne  be fair at eye
It wolde rather breste a two  than plye
 ffor which here  for the wyues loue of Bathe
Whos lyf  and al hire secte  God mayntene
In heigh maistrie  and elles were it skathe
I wol with lusty hert  fressh and grene
Seyn ȝow a song  to glade ȝow I wene
And late vs stynt  of ernestful matere
Herkeneth my song  that seith in this manere
GRisilde is ded  and eke hire pacience
And bothe at ones  Iberied in Itaylle
ffor which I crie  in open audience
No wedded man  so hardy be  to assaylle
his wyues pacience  in trost to fynde
Grisildis  for in certeyn he shal fayle


 O noble wyues  ful of heigh prudence
lat noon humilite  ȝoure tonges nayle
Ne late no Clerk  haue cause or diligence
To wryte of ȝow  a storie of swich meruaille  
As of Grisilde  pacient and kynde
lest Chechiuache  ȝow swelwe  in hire entraille
 ffolweth Ekko  that holdeth noon silence
But euere answereth  at the counter taille
Beth nat bedaffed  for ȝoure Innocence
But sharply taketh on ȝow  the gouernaille
Emprenteth wel  this lesson  in ȝoure mynde
ffor comune profyt  sithe it may availle
 Ȝe Archewyues  stondeth ay at defence
Syn ȝe ben stronge  as is a gret Camaille
Ne suffreth nat  that men ȝow do offence
And sklendre wyues  feble as in bataille
Beth egre  as a Tygre is beȝonde in Inde
Ay clappeth as a Mille  I ȝow counsaille
 Ne drede hem nat  doth hem no reuerence
For though thyn husbonde  armed be in maille
The arwes of thyn crabbed  eloquence
Shal perse his brest  and eke his auentaille
In ielousye  I rede eke thow him bynde
And þou shalt make him couche  as doth a quaille
 If thow be fair  there folk ben in presence
Shewe thow thy vysage  and thyn apparaille
If thow be foule  be free of thyn dispence
To gete the frendes  ay do thyn trauaille
Be ay of chere as light  as lef on lynde
And late him care  wepe  wrynge  and waille


 This worthy Clerk  whan ended was his tale
Oure host seyde  and swor by goddes bones
Me were leuere  than a Barel of ale
My wyf at hom  had herd this legend ones
This is a gentil tale  for the nones
As to my purpos  wyst ȝe my wylle
But thyng that wol nat be  lat it be stille
Wepyng and waylyng  care and other sorwe  
I knowe Inow  on Euen and on morwe
Quod the Marchaunt  and so don othere moo
That wedded ben  I trowe that it be so
fful wel I wot  it fareth so by me
I haue a wyf  the werste that may be
For though the fend  to hire Icoupled were
She wolde him ouermacche  I dar wel swere
what shulde I ȝow reherce  in special
hire heye malice  she is a shrewe withal
There is a long  and a large difference
Betwix Grisildis  grete pacience
And of my wyf  the passyng cruelte
were I vnbounden  also mot I the
I wolde neuere eft  comen in the snare
we wedded men  lyue in sorwe and care
Assay whoso wyl  and he shal fynde
That I seye soth  be seynt Thomas of Inde
As for the more part  Iseye nat alle
God shilde that it shulde  so byfalle
A goode sire hoost  I haue Iwedded be
Theise Monthes two  and more nat parde
And ȝet I trowe  that he that al his lyue
wyflees hath ben  though that men wold him ryue
vnto the hert  ne coude in no manere
Tellen so meche sorwe  as I now here
Coude tellen  of my wyues cursidnes
Now quod oure host  Marchaunt so god ȝow blis
Syn ȝe so mechil knowen  of that art
fful hertily I pray ȝow  telle vs part
Gladly quod he  but of myn owen sore
ffor sory hert  I telle may no more

WHilom there was dwellyng  in Lumbardie
A worthy knyght  that born was of Pauye
In which he leued  in gret prosperite
And Sexty ȝere  a wyfles man was he
And folwed ay  his bodily delyt
On wommen  there as was his appetit
As don theise fooles  that ben seculere
And whan that he was passed  sexty ȝere
Were it for holynesse  or for dotage  
I can nat sey  but swich a gret corage
had this knyght  to ben a wedded man
That day and nyght  he doth al that he can
To spye  where he myght  wedded be
Preying oure lord  to graunte him that he
Myght ones knowe  of thilk blisful lyf
That is bytwix  an husbonde and his wyf
And for to lyue  vnder that holy bond
with which  that first  god  man and womman bond
Noon other lyf seide he  is worth a bene
ffor wedlak is so esy  and so clene
That in this world  it is a Paradyse
Thus seyde this olde knyght  that was so wyse
And certeynly as soth  as god is kyng
To take a wyf  it is a glorious thyng
And namely whan a man  is old and hore
Than is a wyf  the fruyt of his tresore
Than shuld he take  a ȝong wyf and a feyre
Of which he myght  engender him an Eyre


And lede his lyf  in Ioye and solace
where alle theise bacheleres  syngen allas
whan that they fynd  any aduersitee
In loue  which is but childissh vanyte
And trewely it syt wel  to be so
That bacheleres  han oft tyme peyne and woo
On brotel ground  they bilde  and brothilnesse
They fynde  whan they wene sekernesse
They lyue but as a bird  or as a beest
In liberte  and vnder noon areest
There as a wedded man  in his estate
lyueth a lyf blisseful  and ordinate
vnder this ȝok  of mariage Ibounde
wel may his hert  in Ioye and blisse habounde
ffor who can be  so buxum as a wyf
who is so trewe  and eke so ententyf
To kepe him syke and hole  as is his make
ffor wel or woo  she wyl him nat forsake
She nys nat wery  him to loue and serue
Though that he lye  bedrede  til he sterue
And ȝet somme Clerkes seyn  it is nat so
Of which  Theofaste  is on of thoo
what force  though Theofaste list lye
Ne take þou no wyf quod he  for husbondrye
As for to spare  in houshold thyn dispence
A trewe seruaunt  doth more diligence
Thy good to kepe  than thyn owen wyf
ffor she wyl cleyme half part  al hire lyf  
And if þou be syke  so god me saue
Thyne verray frendes  or a trewe knaue
wyln kepe the bet  than she that wayteth ay
After thy good  and hath don many a day
And if thow take a wyf  of heye lynage
She shal be hauteyn  and of gret costage
Theise sentences  and an hondred thynges worse
wryteth this man  there god his soule curse


But take no kepe  of all swich vanyte
Diffye Theofaste  and herkene to me
A wyf is goddis ȝifte  verrayly
Alle othere manere ȝiftes  hardily
As  londes  Rentes  Pasture or Comune
Or mebles  alle ben ȝiftes of fortune
That passen  as a shadewe on a wal
But drede nat  if pleynly speke I shal
A wyf wol last  and in thyn hous endure
wel lengere  than the list perauenture
Mariage is  a ful gret sacrament
he that hath no wyf  I holde him shent
he lyueth helpelees  and al dissolate
I speke of folk  in seculer estate
And herkene why  I seye nat this for nought
That womman is  for mannes help Iwrought
The heye god  whan he had Adam maked
And saw him alone  bely naked
God of his gret goodnes  seide than
Lat vs now make  an helpe vnto this man
lyke to him self  and thanne he mad him Eue
here may ȝe se  and heereby may ȝe preeue
That wyf is mannes help  and his comfort
his paradise terrestre  and his disport
So buxum  and so vertuous is she
They must nedes  lyue in vnite
O flessh they ben  and oo flessh as I gesse
hath but on hert  in wele and in distresse
A wyf  a Seynt Mary benedicite
how myght a man  han ony aduersite
That hath a wyf  certes I can nat sey
The blisse ther is  betwix hem twey
There may no tonge telle  or herte thynke
if he be poore  she helpeth him to swynke
She kepeth his good  and wasteth neuere a dele
Al that hire husbonde lust  hire liketh wele


She seith nat ones nay  whan she seith ȝe  
Do this seith he  al redy sire seith she
O blisseful ordre of wedlak  preciouse
Thow that art so mery  and eke so vertuouse
And so comended  and approued eke
That ony man  þat holdith him worth a leke
vpoon his bare knees  ought al his lyf
Thanke his god  that him hath sent a wyf
Or ellis preye to god  hym for to sende
A wyf  to laste  vnto his lyues ende
ffor than his lyf  is sette in sekernes
he may nat be  disseyued as I gesse
So that he werke  after his wyues rede
Than may he boldely  bere vp his hede
They ben so trewe  and therwithal so wyse
ffor which  if þou wylt werke  as the wyse
Do alwey  so as wommen wol the rede
Lo how þat Iacob  as theise Clerkes rede
By good counseil  of his Moder rebekke
Bond the kydes skyn  aboute his nekke
ffor which  his fadres benyson he wan
Lo Iudyth  as the story eke telle can
Be wys counseil  she goddis peeple kepte
And slough him  Olofernus  while he slepte
lo Abygall  by good counseil  how she
Saued hire husbonde  Nabal  whan that he
Shulde haue be slayn  and loke Ester also
By good counseil  delyuered out of woo
The peeple of god  and mad him Mardochee
Of Assuer  enhaunced for to be
There nys no thyng  in gree superlatyf
As seith Senek  aboue an humble wyf
Suffre thy wyues tonge  as Caton byt
She shal comaunde  and þou shalt suffren it
And ȝet she wyl obeye  of curteisye
A wyf is kepere  of thyn husbondrye


wel may the syke man  bywaylle and wepe
There as nys no wyf  the hous to kepe
I warne the  if wysely þou wolt werche
loue wel thy wyf  as crist loued his chirche
If þou loue thy self  thow louest thy wyf
Noman hateth his flessh  but in his lyf
he fostreth it  and therfore bidde I the
Chere thy wyf  or thow shalt neuere thee
husbonde or wyf  what so men iape or pleye
Of worldly folk  holden the sekyr weye
They ben so knyt  there may noon harm betide  
And namely vpoon the wyues syde
 This olde knyght Ianuare  of which I tolde
Considered hath  withInne his dayes olde
The lusty lyf  the vertuouse quiete
That is in mariage  hony swete
And for hise frendes  oon a day he sent
To tellen hem  the effect  of his entent
with face sad  this tale he hath hem told
he seide frendes  I am hore and old
And almost god wot  oon pittis brynke
vpon my soule  somwhat must I thynke
I haue my body  fouly dispended
Blissed be god  that it shal be amended
And that anoon  in al the hast that I can
ffor I wol be certeyn  a wedded man
vnto sum maide  fair and tendre of age
I preye ȝow shapeth  for my mariage
Al sodeynly  for I wol nat abide
And I wyl fond  to spien of my syde
To whom I may be wedded  hastily
But forasmeche  as ȝe ben moo than I
Ȝe shuln rather  swich a thyng aspien
Than I  and where  me best were to allien
But oo thyng warne I ȝow  my frendes deere
I wol noon old wyf haue  in no manere


She shal not passe  sextene ȝer certeyn
Olde fyssh and ȝonge flessh  wolde I haue fayn
Bet quod he is a Pyke  than a Pykerell
And bet than olde Beef  is the tendre vell
I wol no womman  thretty ȝer of age
It is but benstraw  and gret forage
And eke theise olde wydewes  god it wot
They knowe so meche craft  on wades bot
So meche broken harm  whan hem liste
That with hem  shuld I neuere lyue in reste
ffor sondry scoles  maken subtil clerkes
A womman of many scoles  half a clerk is
But certeynly  a ȝonge thyng  moun men gye
Right as men moun warme wex  with hondis plye
Wherfore I seye ȝow  pleynly in a clause
I wol noon olde wyf haue  right for this cause
ffor if so were  I had swich myschaunce
That I in hire  coude haue no plesaunce
Than shuld I lede my lyf  in avoutree
And streight go to the deuel  whan I deye  
Ne children shulde I noone  vpoon hire geten
Ȝet were me leuere  houndes had me eten
Than that myn heritage  shulde falle
In straunge hand  and this I telle ȝow alle
I doute nought  I wot the cause why
Men shulde wedde  and forthermore wot I
There speketh many man  of mariage
That wot no more of it  than wot my page
ffor which causes  man shulde take a wyf
If he ne may nat  lyue chast his lyf
Take him a wyf  with gret deuocion
By cause of leueful  procreacion
Of children  to honour of god aboue
And nat oonly  for paramour or loue
And for they shuld  lecherie eschue
And ȝelde here dettes  whan that it is due


Or for that eche of hem  shulde helpen other
In myschief  as a suster shal the brother
And lyue in chastite  ful holily
But sires be ȝoure leue  that am nat I
ffor god be thanked  I dar mak avaunt
I fele myne lymes stark  and sufficeaunt
To do al that a man  bylongeth to
I wot my self best  what I may do
Though I be hore  I fare as doth a tree
That blomyth  er þat fruyt Iwexen be
A blosmy tree  nys neither drye ne dede
I fele me nowher hore  but oon myn hede
My herte and alle myne lymes  ben as grene
As laurell thurgh the ȝere  is for to sene
And syn that ȝe  han herd al myn entent
I preye ȝow to my wyl  ȝe wyln assent
Dyuerse men  diuersly him told
Of mariage  manye ensaumples old
Some blamed it  some preised it certeyn
But at the laste  shortly for to seyn
As al day falleth  altercacion
Betwixe frendes  in disputacion
There fel a strif  betwix hise bretheren two
Of which  þat on  was cleped  Placebo
Iustinus sothly  called was that other
Placebo seide  o Ianuare brother
fful litel nede  had ȝe my lord so deere
Counseil to aske  of ony that is heere
But that ȝe ben  so ful of sapience  
That ȝow ne lyketh  for ȝoure heygh prudence
To wyue fro the word  of Salamon
This word seide he  vnto vs euerychon
Werk al thyng be counseil  thus seide he
And thanne shalt þou nat  repente the
But though that Salamon  spak swich a word
Myn owen dere brother  and my lord


So wysly god my soule  brynge at rest
I holde ȝoure owen counseil  is the best
ffor brother myn  of me take this motyf
I haue now ben  a courte man al my lyf
And god it wot  though I vnworthy be
I haue stonden  in ful gret degree
Aboue lordes  of ful heigh astate
Ȝet had I neuere  with noon of hem debate
I neuere hem contraried  trewely
I wot wel that my lord  can more than I
What that he seith  I holde it ferme and stable
I seye the same  or ellis thyng semblable
A ful gret fool  is ony counseillour
That serueth any lord  of heigh honour
That dar presume  or ellys thynken it
That his counseil  shulde passe his lordes wyt
Nay  lordes be none fooles be my fay
Ȝe han ȝoure self  seid heere today
So heigh sentence  so holily and so wele
That I consente  and conferme euerydele
Ȝoure wordes alle  and ȝoure opynyon
By god there nys man  in al this toun
Ne in ytaille  coude bet haue Iseyd
Crist halt hym  of this counseille ful wel paid
And trewely it is  an heigh corage
Of ony man  that stopen is in age
To take a ȝong wyf  be my fader kyn
Ȝoure hert hangeth  oon a Ioly pyn
Doth now in this matere  right as ȝow lyst
ffor ffynally  I holde it for the best
 Iustinus that ay stille sat  and herde
Right in this wyse  he to Placebo answerde
Now brother myn  be pacient I pray
Syn ȝe han seid  and herkene what I sey
Senek  amongis hise othere wordes wyse
Seith  that a man  ought him right wel avyse


To whom hem ȝeueth his lond or his Catel
And syn I ought  avyse me right wel  
To whom I ȝoue  my good awey fro me
Wel meche more I ought  avysen me parde
To whom I ȝeue my body  for alwey
I warne ȝow wele  it is no childes pley
To take a wyf  withouten avysement
Men must enquere  this is myn assent
Wheiþer she be wys  and sobre  or dronkelewe
Or proud  or ellis  other weyes a shrewe
A chidere  or a wastour of thy good
Or riche or poore  or ellis mannyssh wood
Al be it so  that no man fynden shal
Noon in this world  that trotteth hool in al
Ne man ne best  swich as men coude deuyse
But natheles  it ought Inow suffise
With any wyf  if so were that she had
Moo goode thewes  than hire vices bad
And al this askith leyser  for to enquere
ffor god it woot  I haue wept many a tere
fful preuyly  syn that I hadde a wyf
Preyse who so wyl  a wedded mannys lyf
Certeyn I fynde in it  but cost and care
And obseruaunces  of alle blisses bare
And ȝet god wot  myne neyghebores aboute
And namely of wommen  many a route
Seyn  that I haue  the most stedefast wyf
And eke the mekest  on that berith lyf
But I wot best  where wryngeth me my sho
Ȝe moun for me  right as ȝow liketh do
Auyseth ȝow  ȝe ben a man of age
how that ȝe entren  into mariage
And namely  with a ȝong wyf and a fair
Be him that made  water  Erthe  and Eyr
The ȝongest man that is  in al this route
Is besy Inow to bryngen it aboute


To han his wyf alone  trosteth me
Ȝe shuln nat plese hire  fully ȝeres thre
That is to seyn  to don hire ful plesaunce
A wyf asketh  ful many an obseruaunce
I pray ȝow  that ȝe be nat  euele apaid
 Wel quod this Ianuarie  and hast þou seid
Straw for thy Senek and for thyne prouerbes
I counte it nat a panyere ful of herbes
Of scole termes wysere men than thow
As þou hast herd  assentyd right now
To my purpos  Placebo what seye ȝe  
I seye it is a cursed man  quod he
That lettith matrimoyne  sekerly
And with that word  they resyn sodeynly
And ben assentid fully  that he shulde
Be wedded  whan him list  and where he wolde
heigh fantasie  and curious besynesse
ffro day to day  gan in the soule impresse
Of Ianuarie  aboute his mariage
Many fair shap  and many a fair visage
There passeth thurgh his hert  nyght be nyght
As who toke a Myrour  polysshed bryght
And sette it  in a comune  Market place
Than shuld he se  ful many a fygure pace
By his Mirour  and in this same wyse
Gan Ianuarie  withInne his þouȝt deuyse
Of maydenes  which that dwelt him beside
he wyst nought where  that he myght abyde
ffor if that on  haue beaute in hire face
Another stondeth so  in the peeples grace
ffor hire sadnes  and hire benignitee
That of the peeple  the grettest voys hath she
And somme were riche  and had a bad name
But natheles  betwixt ernest and game
he at the last  apoynteth him oon one
And lete alle othere  from his hert gone


And chesith hire  of his owen auctorite
ffor loue is blynde  al day  and may nat se
And whan that he was  in his bed brought
he portrayed in his hert  and in his thought
hire ffressh beaute  and hire age tendre
hire mydel smal  and hire armes sklendre
hire wys gouernaunce  hire gentilnesse
hire wommanly beryng  and hire sadnesse
And whan that he  on hire was condescended
hym thought his choys  myght nat ben amended
ffor whan þat he him self  concluded had
him thought  eche other mannys wyt so bad
That inpossible it were  to replie
Ageyn his choise  this was his fantasie
hise frendes sent he to  at his instaunce
And preyed hem  to do him that plesaunce
That hastily they woldyn  to him come
he wold aquyt here labour  al and some
Nedith it no more  for him to go ne ride  
he was apoynted  there he wold abyde
Placebo cam  and eke hise frendes sone
And alderfirst  he bad hem alle a boone
That noone of hem  noone argumentez make
Ageyn the purpos  which þat he hath take
Which purpos  was plesyng to god  seide he
And verray ground  of his prosperite
he seide there was  a mayden in the toun
Which that of beaute  had gret renoun
Al were it so  she were of smal degree
Suffiseth hym  hire ȝouthe and hire beaute
Which maide he seide  he wolde han to his wyf
To leade in ease and holynesse  his lyf
And thanke god  that he myght haue hire al
That no wyght  his blisse parten shal
he preyed hem  to laboure in this nede
And shape that he  faille nat to spede


ffor than he seide  his spirit was at ease
Than is quod he  no thyng may me displese
Saue o thyng  prykketh in my conscience
The which I wol reherce  in ȝoure presence
I haue quod he herd seid  ful ȝore ago
There may no man haue  parfyt blisses two
This is to seyn  in erthe and eke in heuene
ffor though he kepe him  fro the sinnes seuene
And eke from euery braunche  of thilke tree
Ȝet is there  so parfyt felicite
And so gret ese  and lust in mariage
That euere I am agast  now in myn age
That I shal lede now  so mery a lyf
So delicat  withouten woo and strif
That I shal haue  myn heuene in erthe heere
ffor sithe that verray heuene  is bought so dere
With tribulacions  and gret penaunce
how shuld I than  that lyue in swich plesaunce
As alle wedded men  don with here wyues
Come to the blisse  there crist eterne  oon lyue ys
This is my drede  and ȝe myne bretheryn twey
Assoyleth me  this question  I prey
Iustinus  which that hated his foly
Answered anoon  right in his iapery
And for he wold  his longe tale abregge
he wold noon auctorite  allege
But seide sire  so there be noon obstacle
Othere than this  god of his heye myracle  
And of his mercy  may so for ȝow werche
That er ȝe han  ȝoure rightis of holi chirche
Ȝe may repent  of wedded mannys lyf
In which ȝe seyn  there nys no woo ne strif
And elles god forbede  but he sent
A wedded man  hym grace to repent
Wel oft rather  than a sengle man
And þerfore sire  the best red that I can


Despeire ȝow nought  but haue in ȝoure memorie
Parauenture she may  be ȝoure purgatorie
She may be goddis meene  and goddis whip
Than shal ȝoure soule  vp to heuene skip
Swiftere than an arwe  doth out of a bowe
I hope to god  hereafter shuln ȝe knowe
That there nys noon  so gret felicite
In mariage  ne neuere more shal be
That ȝow shal lette  of ȝoure sauacion
So that ȝe vse  as skyl is and reson
The lustes of ȝoure wyf  attemprely
Take hem nat ofte  but mesurabely
And that ȝe kepyn ȝow  eke  from other synne
My tale is don  for my wyt is thynne
Beth nat agast  hereof  my brother dere
But late vs waden  out of this matere
The wyf of Bathe  if ȝe han vnderstonde
Of mariage  which we han oon honde
Declared  hath  ful wel in litel space
ffareth now wel  god haue ȝow in his grace
 And with that word  this Iustinus and his brother
han tan here leue  and ech of hem of other
ffor whan they saugh  that it must nedes be
They wroughten so  by sleyte and wys tretee
That she this Mayde  which that Mayus hight
As hastily  as euere that she myght
Shal wedded be  vnto this Ianuarie
I trowe it were  to longe ȝow to tarie
If I ȝow told  of euery script and bond
By which that she  was feffed in his lond
Or for to rekken  of hire riche aray
But finally  Icomen is that day
That to the chirche  bothe be they went
ffor to resceyue  the holy sacrament
fforth cometh the prest  with stole aboute his nekke
And bad hire be lyke  Sarra and Rebekke


In wysdom  and in trouthe of mariage
And seide hise orisouns  as is vsage
And crouched hem  and bad god shuld hem blis
And mad al seker Inow  with holynes  
THus ben they wedded  with solempnyte
And at the fest sitteth  he and she
With othere worthy folk  vpoon the deys
Al ful of ioye and blisse  is the paleys
And ful of Instrumenteȝ  and of vetaille
The most deynteuous  of al ytaille
Byforn hem were there  Instrumentes of swich soun
That Orpheus  nor Thebes Amphioun
Ne maden neuere  swich a melody
At euery cours  than cam loud Mynstralsy
That neuere tromped  Ioab  for to here
Ne he Theodomas  half so clere
At Thebes  whan the Citee was in doute
Bacus  the wyn  hem shynketh al aboute
And venus laugheth  vpoon euery wyght
ffor Ianuarie  was bycome hire knyght
And wolde both assayen  his corage
In liberte  and eke in mariage
And with hire fyrbrond  in hire hand aboute
Daunceth byforn the Bryde  and al the route
And certeynly  I dar wel seyn this
That Ymeneus  which god of weddyng is
Saw neuere his lyf  so merye a wedded man
holde þou thy pees  thow Poete Marcian
That wrytest vs  that ilke weddyng mery
Of hire philosophie  and hym Marcury
And of the songes  that the Muses song
To smal is bothe thy penne  and eke thy tong
ffor to discryuen  of this mariage
whan tendre ȝouthe  hath wedded stoupyng age
There is swich myrthe  that it may nat be wretyn
Assayeth it ȝoure self  than may ȝe wetyn


If that I lye  or noon  in thys matere
Mayus that syt  with so benigne a chere
hire to byholde  it semed feyrie
Quene Ester  loked neuere with swich an eye
On Assure  so meke a loke hath she
I may ȝow nat deuyse  al hire beaute
But thus muche  of hire beaute  tellen I may
That she was lyke  the bright morwe of May
ffulfilled of al beaute  and plesaunce
This Ianuarie  is rauysshed  in a traunce
At euery tyme  he loked oon hire face
But in his hert  to gan hire to manace
That he that nyght  in armes wolde hire streyne
Hardere  than euere Parys  dide Elyne  
But nathelees  ȝet had he gret pitee
That thilke nyght  offende hire must he
And thought allas  o tendre creature
Now wolde god  ȝe myght wel endure
Al my corage  it is so sharp and kene
I am agaast  ȝe shuln it nat sustene
But god forbede  that I dide al my myght
Now wolde god  that it were wexin nyght
And that the nyght  wolde lasten euere moo
I wolde  that al this peeple  were ago
And finally  he doth al his labour
As he best myght  sauyng his honour
To hast hem fro the mete  in subtil wyse
The tyme cam  that reson was to ryse
And after that  men daunce  and drynke fast
And spices  al aboute the hous  they cast
And ful of ioye and blisse  is euery man
Al but a Squyere  hyght Damyan
which carf byforn the knyght  ful many a day
he was so rauysshed  oon his lady  May
That for the verray peyne  he was ny wood
Almost he swelt  and swoughned as he stood


So sore hath venus hurt him  with hire bronde
As that she bar it  daunsyng in hire honde
And to his bed  he went him hastily
No more of him  at this tyme speke I
But there  I lete him wepe Inow  and pleyne
Til fresshe May  wol rewen oon his peyne
O perilous fire  that in the bedstrawe bredeth
O famulere foo  that his seruyce bedeth
O seruaunt traytour  fals homly hewe
lyke to the Naddere  in bosom sly vntrewe
God shilde vs alle  from ȝoure acqueyntaunce
O Ianuarie  dronken in plesaunce
In mariage  se how thy Damyan
Thyn owen squyer  and thy born man
Entendeth  for to do the velanye
God graunt the  thyn homely foo  to spye
ffor in this world  nys werse pestilence
Than homely foo  al day in thy presence
Parfourmed hath the Sonne  his Ark diurne
No lengere may  the body of him soiourne
On the orison  as in that latitude
Night with his mantel  that is derk and rude
Gan ouersprede  the Emysperye aboute
ffor which  departed is  this lusty route
ffor Ianuarie  with thank oon euery syde
Hom to here hous  lustily they ryde  
where as they don  here thynges as hem list
And whan they saw here tyme  go to rest
 Sone after that  this hasty Ianuarie
wold go to bedde  he wold no lengere tarie
he drynketh  Ypocras  Clarre and Vernage
Of spices hote  to encresen his corage
And many a letuarie  had he ful fyne
Swich as the cursed Monk  Daun Constantyne
hath wryten in his bok  de Coitu
To ete hem alle  he was no thyng eschue


And to hise pryue frendes  thus seide he
ffor goddis loue  as sone as it may be
lat voyden al this hous  in curteys wyse
And they han don  right as he wol deuyse
Men drynken  and the trauers drawen anoon
The bryde was brought  abedde  as stille as a ston
And whan the bed  was with the prest Iblissed
Out of the chaumbre  hath euery wyght him dressed
And Ianuarie  hath fast in armes take
his fressh May  his paradyse his make
he lulleth hire  he kisseth hire ful ofte
with thikke bristelis  of his berd  vnsofte
lyke to the skyn  of houndes fissh  sharp as a brere
ffor he was shaue  al newe  in his manere
he rubbeth hire  aboute hire tendre face
And seide thus  allas  I mot trespace
To ȝow my spouse  and ȝow gretly offende
Er tyme come  that I wol doun descende
But natheles  considereth this quod he
There nys no werkeman  what so euere he be
That may bothe werke wel  and hastily
This wyl be don at leyser  parfytly
It is no force  how longe that we pleye
In trewe wedlake  coupled be we tweye
And blissed be the ȝok  that we ben Inne
ffor in actes  we moun do no synne
A man may do no synne  with his wyf
Ne hurte himself  with his owen knyf
ffor we han leue  to pleye  as by the lawe
Thus labureth he  til that the day gan dawe
And thanne he taketh a soppe  in fyn Clarre
And vpright in his bed  than sitteth he
And after that  he song ful loude and clere
And kissed his wyf  and mad wantoun chere
he was al coltyssh  ful of ragerye
And ful of Iergon  as a flekked pye


The slak skyn  aboute his nekke shaketh
While that he song  so chaunteth he and craketh  
And god wot  what that May  thought in hire hert
Whan she him saw  vpsittyng in his shert
In his nyghtcappe  and with his nekke lene
She preyseth nat  his pleiyng worth a bene
Than seide he thus  my reste wol I take
Now day is come  I may no lengere wake
And doun he leid his hede  and slepe til prime
And afterward  whan that he saw his tyme
vp riseth Ianuarie  but fresshe May
held hire chaumbre  vnto the ferthe day
As vsage is  of wyues  for the beste
ffor euery labour sumtyme  mote haue reste
Or ellis longe may he  nat endure
This is to seyn  no lyues creature
Be it of fyssh or bryd  or beest or man
Now wol I speke  of wooful Damyan
That langwyssheth for loue  as ȝe shuln heere
Therfore I speke to him  in this manere
I seide  o seely Damyan  allas
Answere to myn demaunde  as in this cas
how shalt þou  to thy lady fressh may
Telle thy woo  she wyl alwey sey nay
Eke if þou speke  she wyl thy woo bewrey
God be thyn helpe  I can no betyr sey
This syke Damyan  in venus fyre
So brenneth  that he deyeth for desyre
ffor which he put his lyf  in auenture
No lengere myght he  in this wyse endure
But preuyly a pennere  gan he borwe
And in a lettre wrot he  al his sorwe
In manere of a compleynt  or a lay
Vnto this fair  fressh May
And in a purs of sylk  heng oon his sherte
he hath it put  and leide it at his herte


The Mone that at noon  was that ilke day
That Ianuarie hath wedded  fressh May
In two of Taure  was into Cancre glyden
So longe hath Mayus  in hire chaumbre abeden
As custume is  vnto theise nobles alle
A bryde shal nat  eten in the halle
Til dayes foure  or thre dayes at the lest
Passed ben  than late hire go to feest
The ferthe day complet  fro noon to noon
whan that the heye masse  was Idon
In halle syt this Ianuarie  and May
As fressh as is  the bright Somers day  
And so byfel  how that this goode man
Remembred him  vpoon this Damyan
And seide  Seynt Marie  how may it be
That Damyan  entendeth nat to me
Is he ay syke  or how may it betyde
his squyers  which that stoden  þere beside
Excused him  bycause of his syknes
which letted him  to don his besynes
Noon other cause  myght make him tarie
That me forthynketh  quod this Ianuarie
he is a gentil Squyer  be my trewthe
If that he deyed  it were harm and reuthe
he is as wys  discrete  and as secree
As ony man I knowe  of his degree
And therto manly  and eke seruysable
And for to be a man  thrifty and able
But after mete  as sone as euere I may
I wyl my self  vysyte him  and eke May
To don him al the comfort  that I can
And for that word  him blissed euery man
That of his bounte  and his gentilnesse
he wolde so comfort  in sekenesse
his Squyer  for his gentil dede
Dame quod this Ianuarie  take good hede


At after mete  ȝe with ȝoure wommen alle
whan ȝe han ben in chaumbre  out of this halle
That alle ȝe gon  to se this Damyan
Doth him disport  he is a gentil man
And tellith him  that I wyl him visite
haue I no thyng  but rested me a lyte
And spede ȝow fast  for I wyl abyde
Til that ȝe slepe  fast be my syde
And with that word  he gan to him calle
A Squyer  that was Marchal  of his halle
And told him certeyne thynges  that he wolde
This fressh May  hath streyt  hire weye holde
with alle hire wommen  vnto Damyan
Doun by hise beddis syde  sytte she than
Comfortynge him  as goodly as she may
This Damyan  whan he his tyme sey
In secrete wyse  his purs and eke his bylle
In which that he wryten had  his wylle
hath put into hire hond  withouten more
Saue that he sigheth  wonder depe and sore
And softly to hire  right thus seide he  
Mercy  and that ȝe nought bewreye me
ffor I am ded  if that thyng be kydde
This purs  she withInne hire bosom  hidde
And went hire wey  ȝe gete no more of me
But vnto Ianuarie  ageyn comen is she
That oon his beddis syde  sat ful softe
And takith hire  and kysseth hire ful ofte
And leid him doun to slepe  and that anoon
She feyned hire  as though she must gon
There as ȝe wote  that euery wyght must nede
And whan she of this bille  hath taken hede
She rent it al to peces  at the last
And in the preeue  softely it cast
 who stodieth now  but fair fresshe May
Adoun  by olde Ianuarie  she lay


That slepe  til the coughe hath him waked
Anoon he preyed hire  to strepen hire al naked
he wold of hire he seide  haue som plesaunce
And seide  hire clothes  dide him combraunce
And she obeyeth him  be hire leef or loth
But lest that precious folk  be with me wroth
how that he wrought  I dar nat to ȝow telle
Or wheither hire thought yt  paradys or helle
But heere I lete hem  werken in here wyse
Til Euene song rong  and that they must aryse
were it by destenye  or by auenture
were it by enfluence  or by nature
Or constellacion  that in swich estate
The heuene stod  in that tyme fortunate
was  for to putte a bille  of venus werkes
ffor al thyng hath tyme  as seyn theise clerkes
To euery womman  for to gete hire loue
I can nought seye  but grete god aboue
That knoweth that noon acte  is causelees
he deme of alle  for I wol holde my pees
But soth is this  how that this fressh May
hath take swich impression  that day
Of pitee  of this syke Damyan
That fro hire hert  she ne dryue can
The remembraunce  for to don him eese
Certeyne thought she  whom that this þing displese
I rekke nought  for heere I him assure
To loue him best  of ony creature
Though he no more had  than his sherte
lo pitee  renneth sone  in gentil herte
Heere may ȝe se  how excellent fraunchise  
In womman is  whan they hem narwe avyse
Som tyraunt is  as there be many oone
That hath an herte  as hard as ony stone
which wold han lete him  sterue in the place
wel rather  than haue graunt him hire grace


And hem reioysen  in here cruel pride
And rekke nat  to ben an homycide
This gentil Mayus  fulfilled of pitee
Right of hire hond  a lettre maketh she
In which she graunted him  hire verray grace
There lakketh nought  oonly  but day and space
There as she myght  vnto his lust suffice
ffor it shal be  right as he wol deuyse
And whan she saw hire tyme  vpoon a day
To visite this Damyan  goth this May
And softly this lettre  doun she threst
vnder his Pilewe  rede it if him list
She taketh him by the hond  and hard him twist
So secrely  that no wyght it wyst
And bad him be al hole  and forth she went
To Ianuarie  whan that he for hire sent
vp risith Damyan  the next morwe
Al passed is  his syknes  and his sorwe
he kembeth  he proyneth him  and pyketh
he doth  al that his lady lust  and lyketh
And eke to Ianuarie  he goth as lowe
As euere dide a dogge  for the bowe
he is so plesaunt  to euery man
ffor craft is al  who so that do yt can
That euery wyght is fayn  to speke him good
And fully  in hise ladies grace  he stod
Thus lete I Damyan  aboute his nede
And in my tale  forth I wyl procede
 Some Clerkys holden  that felicite
Stant in delite  and therfore certeyne he
This noble Ianuarie  with al his myght
In honest wyse  as longeth to a knyght
shope him to lyue  ful deliciously
his housyng is arrayed  as honestly
To his degree  was maked  as a kynges
Amonges othere  of hise honest thynges


he mad a gardeyne  walled al with stone
A fairere gardeyne  what I no wher noone
ffor out of doute  I verraily suppose
That he that wrot  the Romauns of the Rose
Ne coude of it  the beaute wel deuyse  
Ne Priapus  myght nought suffise
Though he be god  of gardeynes for to telle
The beaute of the gardeyn  and the welle
That stod vnder a laurer  alwey grene
fful ofte tyme he  Pluto and his Quene
Proserpina  and al hire feyree
Disporten hem  and maken melodee
Aboute that welle  and daunsyng as men told
 This noble knyght  Ianuarie the old
Swich deynte hath  in it to walke and pley
That he wol suffre  no wyght bere the key
But he him self  for of the smal wyket
he bar alwey  of siluere  a cleket
With whiche  whan that him liste  he it vnshette
And whan he wold pay  his wyues dette
In somer seson  thider wold he go
And May his wyf  and no wyght but they two
And thynges  which  that were nat don abedde
he in the gardeyn  parfourmed hem  and spedde
And in this wyse  ful many a mery day
lyueth this Ianuarie  and this fressh May
 But worldly ioye  may nought alwey endure
To Ianuarie  ne to no creature
O sodeyne hap  o thow fortune vnstable
lyke to the Skorpion  so disceyuable
That flaterest with thyn hede  whan þou wylt stynge
Thy tail is deth  thurgh thyn envenemynge
O brotel ioye  o swete venym queynte
O monstre  that so sotelly  canst peynte
Thy ȝiftes  vnder hewe of stedfastnes
That thow disceyuest  bothe more and lesse


Why hast þou  Ianuarie  thus disceyued
That haddest him  for thy ful frend resceyued
And now þou hast byreft him  bothe his eyen
ffor sorwe of which  he desireth to deyen
Allas this noble Ianuarie  the free
Amydde hise lust  and his prosperitee
Is woxen blynd  and that al sodeynly
he wepeth  he weyleth also  pitously
And therewithal  the fire of Ielousie
leste that his wyf  shulde falle in som folie
So brent his hert  that he wolde fayn
That som man  bothe hire and him had slayn
ffor neither after his deth  ne in his lyf
Ne wolde he  þat she were  no loue ne wyf
But euere lyue as a wydewe  in clothes blake  
Shu as the Turtyl  that lost hath hire make
But at the last  after a moneth or twey
his sorwe gan to aswage  soth to sey
ffor whan he wyst  it myght noon other be
he paciently took  his aduersitee
Saue out of doute  he may nat forgon
That he nas ielous  euere more in on
Which ielousie  it was so outrageous
That neither in Halle  ne in non oþer hous
Ne in non other place  neuere the moo
he nolde suffre hire  for to ryde ne goo
But if he had hond  on hire alwey
ffor which ful ofte  wepeth fressh May
That loueth Damyan  so benygnely
That she mot either deyen  sodeynly
Or ellis she mot han him  as hire list
She wayteth whanne  hire hert wold brest
 vpon that other syde  Damyan
Bycomen is  the sorwefullest man
That euere was  for neither nyght ne day
Ne myght he speke  a word  to fressh May


As to his purpos  of no swich matere
But if that Ianuarie  must it heere
That had an hand  vpon hire  euere moo
But natheles  be wrytyng to and froo
And pryue signes  wyst he what she ment
And she knewe eke  the fyn of his entent
 O Ianuarie  what myght it the availle
Though þou myght seen  as fer as shippes seylle
ffor as good is blynd  disceyued be
As ben disceyued  whan a man may se
lo Argue  which that had  an hondred eyen
ffor al that euere he coude  poure or preyen
Ȝet was he blynd  as god wot so ben moo
That wenen wysely  that it be nat so
Passe ouer  is an ease  I sey no more
This fressh May  that I spak of bifore
In warme wex  hath enprented the cliket
That Ianuarie bar  of the smal wyket
By which  into his gardeyn  oft he went
And Damyan that knew  al hire entent
The cliket countrefetet  preuyly
There is nomore to seye  but hastily
Som wonder by this cliket  shal betide
Which ȝe shuln heren  if ȝe wiln abide  
 O noble Ouyde  ful soth seist þou god wot
What sleithe is it  though it be long and hot
That loue nyl fynde it out  in som manere
By Priamus and Tisbe  may ȝe leere
Though they were kept ful longe  and streite ouer alle
They ben accorded  rounyng thurgh a walle
There no wyght coude han founde out  swich a sleight
But now to the purpos  or that deyes eight
were passed  er that the monthe of Iull  byfelle
That Ianuarie hath caught  so gret a wylle
Thurgh eggyng of his wyf  him for to pley
In his gardeyn  and no wyght but they twey


That in a morwe  vnto this May seith he
Ryse vp my wyf  my loue  my lady free
The turtles voys is herd  my dowe so swete
The wynter is gon  with hise reynes wete
Come forth now  with thyne eyne Columbyne
how meche fairere  ben thyne brestes  than is wyne
The gardeyn is enclosed  al aboute
Come forth my swete spouse  for out of doute
Thow hast we wounded  in myn hert  O wyf
No spot ne knowe I in the  in al my lyf
Come forth  and late vs taken  oure disport
I chese the for my wyf  and my comfort
Swiche olde  lewede wordes  vsed he
On Damyan  a signe mad she
That he shulde go byforn  with his clyket
This Damyan  than hath opened the wyket
And in he stirt  and that in swich manere
That no wyght  myght him se  neither heere
And stille he syt  vnder a bussh anoon
This Ianuarie  as blynd as ony ston
With Mayus in his hond  and no wyght moo
Into this fressh gardeyn  is agoo
And claped to  the wyket  sodeynly
Now wyf quod he  here is but ȝe and I
Thow art the creature  that I best loue
ffor be that lord  that syt in heuene aboue
leuer I had to deyen  on a knyf
Than the offende  trewe dere wyf
ffor goddis sake  thynk how I the ches
Nought for no coueitise  douteles
But oonly for the loue  I had to the
And though that I be olde  and may nat se
Beth to me trewe  and I wyl telle ȝow why  
Thre thynges certes  shuln ȝe wynne therby
ffirst  loue of Crist  and to ȝoure self  honour
And al myn heritage  bothe toun and tour


I ȝeue it ȝow  maketh chartres as ȝow list
This shal be don  tomorwe or the sonne rist
So wysly god my soule  brynge into blysse
I preye ȝow first  in couenaunt ȝe me kisse
And though I be ielous  wyte me nought
Ȝe ben so depe  enprented in my thought
That whan I considre  ȝoure beaute
And therwithal  the vnlikly age of me
I may nought certes  though I shulde deye
fforbere to ben  oute of ȝoure companye
ffor verray loue  this is withouten doute
Now kisse we wyf  and late vs rome aboute
 This fresshe May  whan she theise wordes herd
Benygnely  to Ianuarie she answerd
But first and forward  she bygan to wepe
 I haue quod she  god wot  a soule to kepe
As wel as ȝe  and also myn honour
And of my wyfhod  thilke tendre flour
Which that I haue assured  in ȝoure hond
Whan that the prest  to ȝow my body bond
Wherfore I wyl answere  in this manere
By the leue of ȝow  that ben my lord so dere
I preye to god  that neuere dawe the day
That I ne sterue  as foule as a womman may
If euere I do  vnto my kyn  that shame
Or ellis if that I  enpeire so my name
That I be fals  and if I do that lak
Do stripe me  and put me in a sak
And in the nexte Ryuer  do me drenche
I am a gentil womman  and no wenche
Why speke ȝe thus  but men ben euere vntrewe
And wommen han of ȝow  repref ay newe
Ȝe conne noon other countenaunce  I leue
But speke to vs  as of vntrust and repreue
And with that word  she saw where Damyan
Sat in a Bussh  and coughe she bygan


And with hire fynger  a signe mad she
That Damyan shulde  clymbe vp oon a tree
That charged was  with fruyt  and vp he went
ffor verraily he knew  al hire entent
And euery signe  that she coude make
Wel betir than Ianuarie  hire owen make  
ffor in a lettre  she had told him alle
Of this matere  how he werken shalle
And thus I lete him sitte  vpoon this Perie
And Ianuarie and May  romyng ful merye
 Bright was the day  and blew the firmament
Phebus hath of gold  hise stremes doun sent
That gladen euery flour  with hise warmnes
he was that tyme  in gemine · as I gesse
But litel from his  declinacion
Of Cancer  Iouis exaltacion
And so byfel  in that bright morwe tyde
That in that gardeyn  in the ferther syde
Pluto that is kyng  of fayrie
And many a lady  in his companye
ffolwyng his wyf  the Quene of Proserpyne
Ech after other  as right as a lyne
While that she gadered  floures in the mede
In Claudian  ȝe moun the stories rede
how in his grisly Cart  he hire fette
 The kyng of fayrie  doun him sette
vpon a benche  of torues faire and grene
And right anoon  thus seide he to the Quene
Now wyf quod he  there may no wyght sey nay
The experience  so preeueth it euery day
The treson  which that womman doth to man
Ten hondred thouȝsand  wel tellen I can
Notable  of ȝoure vntrewthe  and brotilnes
O noble Salamon  rychest of Ryches
ffulfilled of sapience  and of worldly glorie
fful worthy ben thyne wordes  to memorie


To euery wyght  that wyt and reson can
Thus preiseth he ȝet  the bounte of man
Among a thouȝsand men  ȝet fond I one
But of wommen alle  ȝet fond I noone
Thus seith the kyng  that knoweth ȝoure wykkednes
And Ihesus filius Sirac  as I gesse
Ne speketh of ȝow  but selde reuerence
A wylde fyre  and corupte pestilence
So fal vpoon ȝoure bodyes  ȝet tonyght
Ne se ȝe nought  this honurable knyght
Bycause allas  that he is blynd and old
his owen man  shal make him cokewold
lo where he syt  the lechour oon the tree
Now wol I graunte  of my mageste
Vnto this olde  blynde  worthy knyght  
That he shal haue  aȝein  his eyen sight
And whan that his wyf  wold don him velanye
Than shal he knowe  al hire harlotrye
Bothe in repreef of hire  and othere moo
 Ȝee shal quod Proserpyne  wyl ȝe so
Now be my modres soule  sire I ȝow swere
That I shal ȝeuen hire  sufficeaunt answere
And alle wommen after  for hire sake
That though they be  in ony gilt take
with face bold  they shuln hem self excuse
And beren hem doun  that wolden hem accuse
ffor lakke of answere  noon of hem shal deyen
Al had a man  sen a thyng  with hise eyen
Ȝet shuln we wommen  visage it hardily
And wepe and swere  and chide sotelly
So that ȝe men  shuln ben as lewed as gees
what rekketh me  of ȝoure auctorites
I wot wel  that this Iew  this Salamon
ffond of vs wyues  fooles  many on
But though that he fond  no good womman
Ȝet hath there founden  many another man


wommen ful trewe  ful goode and vertuous
wytnesse of hem  that dwellen  in cristis hous
with martirdom  they preeued heere constaunce
The Romayns Iestes  eke  make remembraunce
Of many a verrey  trewe wyf  also
But sire be not wroth  al be it so
Though that he seide  he fond no trewe womman
I prey ȝow take this sentence  as I telle can
She ment thus  that in soueraigne bounte
Nis noon but god  neither he ne she
Ey for verrey god  that nys but one
what make ȝe so meche  of Salamone
what though he mad a temple  goddis hous
what though he were riche  and glorious
So mad he a temple eke  of fals goddis
who myght don a thyng  that more forboden is
Pardee  as fair as ȝe  his name plaistre
he was a lecchour  and an ydolatre
And in his elde  he verray god forsoke
And if that god ne hadde  as seith the boke
Spared him  for his fadres sake  he shulde
haue lost his regne  rather than he wolde
I sette nought  of al the velanye
That he of wommen wrot  a botirflye  
I am a womman  nedes must I speke
Or ellis swelle  til myn hert breke
ffor sithe he seide  that we ben iangelers
As euere hole mote I  brouke my tresses
I shal nat spare  for no curteisie
To speke him harm  that wolde vs velanye
Dame quod this Pluto  be no lengere wroth
I ȝeue it vp  but sithe I swor myn oth
That I wolde graunt him  his sight aȝeyne
my word shal stonde  I warne ȝow certeyne
I am a kyng  it syt me nought to lye
And I quod she  a Quene of fayrie


hire answere shal she haue  I vndertake
lat vs no moo wordes  hereof make
for sothe I wyl no lengere  ȝow contrarie
 Now late vs turne aȝein  to Ianuarie
That in the gardeyn  with hise fair May
Syngeth ful meriere  than the Popyngay
Ȝow loue I best  and shal  and other noon
So longe aboute the Aleys  is he gon
Til he was come ageyn  to thilke perye
where as this Damyan  sitteth ful merye
And heygh  among theise fressh leues grene
This fressh May  that is so bright and shene
Gan for to sighe  and seide allas my syde
Now sire quod she  for ought that may betide
I must haue on of the peeres  that I se
Or I mot deye  so sore longeth me
To eten  of the smale peeres grene
helpe for hire loue  that is heuene Quene
I telle ȝow wel  a womman in my plight
May haue to fruyt  so gret an appetit
That she may deyen  but she it haue
Allas quod he  that I haue here no knaue
That coude clymbe  allas allas quod he
ffor I am blynde  ȝe sire no force quod she
But wolde ȝe vouchesaf  for goddis sake
The Perie  withInne ȝoure armes  for to take
fful wel I wote  that ȝe mystrosten me
Than shulde I clymbe  wel Inow quod she
So I my fote  may sette vpoon ȝoure bak
Certes quod he  therof shal be no lak
Myght I ȝow helpen  with myn hert blode
he stouped doun  and she vpon his bak stode
And caught hire by a twist  and vp she goth
Ladyes I pray ȝow  that ȝe be nat wroth  
I can nat glose  I am a rude man
And sodeynly anoon  this Damyan


Gan pullen vp the smok  and in he thronge
And whan that Pluto  saw this grete wronge
To Ianuarie  he ȝaf anoon his sight
That he thanne  right wel  se myght
And whan þat he  had caught his sight ageyn
Ne was there neuere man  of thyng so feyn
But oon his wyf  his thought was euere moo
vpoon the tree  he cast hise eyen two
And saw that Damyan  hys wyf had dressed
In swich manere  it may nought ben expressed
But if I wold speke  vncurteislye
And vp he ȝaf a rooryng  and a crye
As doth the Moder  whan the child shal deye
Out  help  allas  harrow  he gan to crye
O stronge lady  store  what dost thow
And she answered  sire  what eyleth ȝow
haue pacience and reson  in ȝoure mynde
I haue ȝow holpe  of bothe ȝoure eyen blynde
vp perile of my soule  I shal nat lyen
As me was taught  to helen with ȝoure eyen
was no thyng betir  for to make ȝow se
Than strogle with a man  vpoon a tree
God wot I dide it  in ful good entent
Strogle quod he  ȝa algate In it went
God ȝeue ȝow bothe  oon shames deth to deyen
he swyued the  I saw it with myne eyen
And elles be I hanged  by the hals
And thanne is quod she  my medycyne fals
ffor certeynly  if that ȝe myght se
Ȝe wolde nat seye  theise wordes vnto me
Ȝe han som glemeryng  and no parfyt sight
I se quod he  as wel as euere I myght
Thanked be god  with bothe myne eyen twoo
And be my trewthe  me thouȝt he dide the so
 Ȝa mase mase  good sire quod she
This thank haue I  for I made ȝow se


Allas quod she  that euere I was so kynde
Now dame quod he  late al passe out of mynde
Come adoun my leef  and if I haue mysseyd
God help me so  as I am euele apayd
But be my fadres soule  I wende haue sen
how that this Damyan  had by the leyn
And that thy smok  had leyn vpoon thy brest  
Ȝa sire quod she  ȝe moun seyn as ȝow lest
But sire  a man  that waketh out of his slepe
he may nat so sodeynly  take kepe
vpoon a thyng  ne seyn it so parfitly
That til he be awaked  verrayly
Right so a man  þat long hath blynd Ibe
Ne may nought sodeynly  so wel se
ffirst  whan his sight  is newe comyn ageyn
As he that hath a day  or tweyne seyn
Til that ȝoure sight  be satled a while
There may ful many a sight  ȝow begyle
Beth war I preye ȝow  for by heuene kyng
fful many a man weneth  to seyn a thyng
And it is al another  than it semeth
he that mys conceyueth  mys demeth
And with that word  she lepe doun fro the tree
This Ianuarie  who is glad but he
he kissith hire  and clippeth hire ful ofte
And oon hire wombe  he streked hire ful softe
And to his Paleys  hom he hath hire ladde
Now goode men  I preye ȝow alle beth gladde
Thus endeth heere my tale  of Ianuarie
God blisse vs alle  and oure lady Seynt Marie
EY goddis mercy  seide oure hoost tho
Now swich a wyf  I preye god kepe me fro
lo swich sleightes  and subtilitees
In wommen ben  for ay as besiens bees
Ben they  vs sely men for to deceyue
And froo a soth  euere wyl they weyue
By this Marchauntes tale  it preueth wel
But doutelees  as trewe as any stel
I haue a wyf  though that she pore be
But of hire tonge  a labbyng shrewe is she
And ȝet she hath an hepe  of vices moo
Therof no fors  lat alle suche thynges goo
But wyte ȝe what  in counseile be it seyde
Me reweth sore  I am vnto hire teyde
ffor and I shuld rekene  euery vyce
Which that she hath  Iwys I were to nyce  
And cause why  it shulde reported be
And tolde to hire  of some of this meyne
Of whom it nedeth nat  for to declare
Syn wommen connen oute  such chaffare
And eke my wyt  suffiseth nat therto
To tellen al  wherfore my tale is do
Squyere come ner  if it ȝoure wylle be
And seye somwhat of loue  for certes ȝe
Konen theroon  as meche as any man
Nay sire quod he  but swich thyng as I can
With hertly wylle  for I wil nought rebelle
Ageyn ȝoure lust  a tale wol I ȝow telle
haue me excused  if I speke amys
My wyl is good  and lo my tale is this
At Sarray  in the lond of Tartarye
There dwelled a kyng  that werred Russye
Thorugh which there deyed  many a doughty man
This noble kyng was cleped  Cambyuscan
Which in his tyme  was of so gret renoun
That ther was nowher  in no region
So excellent a lord  of al thyng
him lakked no thyng  that longeth to a kyng
As of the secte  of which that he was born
he kept his lay  to which that he was sworn
And therto he was hardy  wys and riche
And pitous and Iust  alwey Iliche
Sooth of his word  benygne and honurable
Ad of his corage  alwey sad and stable
Ȝong fressh and strong  in armes desirous
As any bacheler  of al his hous
A faire persone he was  and fortunat
And kept alwey so wel  Real estat
That there nas nowher  such another man
 This noble kyng  this Tartre Cambiuscan
hadde two sones  on Elfeta his wyf
Of which the eldest hight  Algarsyf
That other sone  was called Camballo
A doughter hadde  this worthy kyng also
That ȝongest was  and hight Canacee  
But for to telle ȝow  al hire beaute
It lith nought in my tonge  or my konnynge
I dar nought vndertake  so heigh a thynge


Myn englyssh eke is  insufficient
It must ben a Rethor  excellent
That coude hise colours  longyng for that art
If he shulde hire discryuen  euery part
I nam noon suche  I mot speke as I can
And so byfel  that whan this Cambiuscan
hadde twenty wynter  born his Diademe
As he was wont  fro ȝere to ȝere I deme
he lete the feste  of his Natiuitee
Do crien thurghout Sarray  his Citee
The last ydus of March  after the ȝer
Phebus the Sonne  ful iolyf was and cler
ffor he was ney  his exaltacion
In martes face  and in his mancion
In Aries  the coleryk hote signe
fful lusty was the wedir  and benygne
ffor which the foules  ageyn the sonne shene
What for the seson  and the ȝonge greene
fful loude songen  in here affeccions
hem semed haue geten hem  proteccions
Ageyns the swerd of wynter  kene and colde
This Cambiuscan  of which I haue ȝow tolde
In real vestiment  syt on his deys
With Diademe ful heigh  in his paleys
And halt his feste  so solempne and so riche
That in this world  ne was þere noon it liche
Of which  if I shal tellen  al the array
Than wold it occupie  a someres day
And eke it nedeth nat  for to deuyse
At euery cours  the ordre of here seruyse
I wyl nought tellen  of here straunge sewes
Ne of here swannes  ne here heronsewes
    
    
    
    

I wyl nought tarien ȝow  for it is pryme
And for it is no fruyt  but losse of tyme
vnto my first  I wyl haue myn retours
And so byfel after  the thridde cours
whil that this kyng syt thus  in his nobleye
Herkenyng his mynstralles  here thynges pleye
Biforn him at the bord  deliciously
In at the halle dore  al sodeynly  
There cam a knyght  vpon a steede of Bras
And in his hand  a brode Myrour of glas
Vpon his thombe  he hadde of gold a ryng
And by his syde  a naked swerd hangyng
And vp he rideth  vnto the heigh bord
In al the halle  ne was there spoke a word
ffor merueille of this knyght  him to byholde
fful bisily they wayten  ȝonge and olde
 This straunge knyght  that cam thus sodeynly
Al armed saue his hed  ful richely
Salueth kyng and Quene  and lordes alle
By ordre  as they setyn  in the halle
With so heigh reuerence  and obeisaunce
As wel in speche  as in his countenaunce
That Gawayn  with his olde curteisye
Though he were come ageyn  out of fairye
Ne coude him nought amende  with a word
And after this  bifore the heigh bord
he with a manly voice  seide his message
After the fourme vsed  in his langage
Withouten vice of silable  or lettre
And for his tale  shulde seme the bettre
Accordant to his wordes  was his chiere
As techeth art of speche  hem that it lere
Al be it  that I can nought  sowne his stile
Ne can nought clymben  ouer so heigh a stile
Ȝet sey I this  that as to comune entent
Thus meche amounteth  al þat euere he ment


If it so be  that I haue it in mynde
 He seide the kyng of Arabe  and of Ynde
My lige lord  on this solempne day
Salueth ȝow  as he best can and may
And sendeth ȝow  in honour of ȝoure feste
By me  that am al redy  at ȝoure heste
This steede of Bras  that esily and wel
Can in the space  of oo day naturel
That is to seyn  in foure and twenty houres
Whereso ȝow list  in drought or ellis shoures
Beren ȝoure body  into euery place
To which ȝoure herte wylneth  for to pace
Withouten wem of ȝow  thurgh foule and fair
Or if ȝow list  to fleighe as heigh in the eyr
As doth an Egle  whan him list to sore  
This same Steede  shal bere ȝow eueremore
Withouten harm  til ȝe be there ȝow list
Though that ȝe slepen  on his bak and rest
And turne ageyn  with writhyng of a pyn
he that it wrought  he coude many a gyn
he wayted many  a constellacion
Or he had don  this operacion
And knew ful many  a sel  and many a bonde
 This Mirour eke  that I haue in myn honde
hath swich a myght  that men moun in it se
Whan there shal fallen  any aduersitee
vnto ȝoure regne  or to ȝoure self also
And openly  who is ȝoure frend or foo
And ouer al this  if any lady bright
hath set hire herte  on any maner wyght
If he be fals  she shal his treson see
his newe loue  and al his subtiltee
So openly  there shal no thyng hyde
Wherfore  ageyns this lusty someres tyde
This Myrour and this Ryng  that ȝe may se
he hath sent  to my lady Canacee


Ȝoure excellente doughter  that is here
The vertu of the Ryng  if ye wiln heere
Is this  that if hire list  it  for to were
vpon hire thombe  or in hire purs it bere
There nys no foule  that flieth vnder the heuene
That she ne shal wel  vnderstonde his steuene
And knowe his menyng  openly and pleyn
And answere him  in his langage ageyn
And euery gras  that groweth vpon rote
She shal eke knowe  and whom it wol do bote
Al ben hise woundes  neuere so depe and wyde
 This naked swerd  that hangeth be my syde
Swich vertu hath  that what man þat ȝe smyte
Thurghout his armure  it wil kerue and byte
Were it as thikke  as is a braunched ook
And what man þat is wounded  with the strok
Shal neuere be hol  til that ȝow list of grace
To stroke him with the plat  in thilke place
There he is hurt  this is so meche to seyn
Ȝe mote with the plat swerd  ageyn
Stroke him in the wounde  and it wol close
This is a verray soth  withouten glose
It failleth not  whil it is in ȝoure wolde  
 And whan this knyght  hath thus his tale Itolde
he rideth out of halle  and doun he light
his Steede which that shone  as sonne bright
Stant in the courte  as stille as ony ston
This knyght is to his chaumber  lad anon
And is vnarmed  and to mete Isette
The presentes  ben ful richelich Ifette
This is to seyn  the swerd and the Mirour
And born anon  vnto the heigh Tour
With certeyne officers  ordeyned therfore
And to Canacee  the Ryng is bore
Solempnely  there she sat at the table
But sekerly  withouten any fable


The hors of Bras  that can nought be remewed
Is stant as it were  to the ground Iglewed
There may no man  out of that place it dryue
ffor non engyne  of wyndas or polyue
And cause why  for they conne nought the craft
And therfore in the place  they han it laft
Til that the knyght  hath taught hem the manere
To voiden him  as ȝe shuln after here
 Greet was the prees  that swarmeth to and froo
To gauren on this hors  that stondeth so
ffor it so heigh was  and so brode and longe
So wel proporcioned  for to be stronge
Right as it were a Steede  of lumbardie
Therewith so horsly  and so quyk at eye
As it a gentil poleis  courser were
ffor certes from his taille  vnto his ere
Nature ne art  ne coude him nought amende
In no degree  as al the peple wende
But euere moo  here moost wondre was
how that it coude gon  and was of bras
It was a fayrie  as the peeple semed
Diuerse folk  diuersely han demed
As many hedes  as many wyttes ben
They mormered  as doth a swarm of been
And maden skyles  after here fantasies
Rehersyng  of this olde poetries
And seiden it was like  the pegasee
The hors that hadde  wenges for to flee
Or ellis it was  the Grekes hors sinon
That brought Troye  to destruccion
As men moun  in theise old gestes rede
Myn herte quod on  is eueremo in drede  
I trowe some men of armes  ben thereInne
That shapen hem  this Citee for to wynne
It were right good  that al such thyng were knowe
An other rouned  to his felawe lowe


And seide he lyeth  for it is rather lyk
An apparence Imade  by some magyk
As iogeloures pleyen  at thise grete
Of sondry doutes  thus they Iangle and trete
As lewede peeple demen  comunely
Of thynges that ben made  more subtily
Than they can  in here lewednes comprehende
They demen gladly  to the baddere ende
 And some of hem wondred  on the Mirour
That born was vp  vnto the maister Tour
how men myght in it  swich thynges se
Another answered and seide  it myght wel be
Naturely  by composicions
Of anglys  and of sligh reflexions
And seiden  that in Rome  was swich on
They spoken of Alocen  and vitulon
Of Aristotle  that wretyn in here lyues
Of queynt Miroures  and of perspectyues
As knowen they  that han here bokes herd
And other folk  han wondred on the swerd
That wolde percen  thurghout euery thyng
And feln in speche  of Thelephus the kyng
And of Achilles  for his queynt spere
ffor he coude with it  bothe hele and dere
Right in swich gise  as men moun with the swerd
Of which right now  ȝe han ȝoure seluen herd
They speken of sondry hardyng  of metal
And speken of medicynes  therwithal
And how and whanne  it shulde Iharded be
Which is vnknowe  algates vnto me
Tho speken they  of Canaces ryng
And seiden alle  that swich a wonder thyng
Of craft of Rynges  herd they neuere non
Saue that he Moyses  and kyng Salamon
hadden a name of konnyng  in swich art
Thus seith the peeple  and drawen hem apart


But nathelees some seiden  that it was
Wonder to make  of ffern asshen  glas
And ȝet is glas  nought lyke asshen of fern
And for they han Iknowen it  so fern  
Therfore cesseth here iangelyng  and here wonder
As sore wonder some  on cause of thonder
On ebbe on flode  on gossomer and on myst
And on alle thynge  til þat the cause is wist
Thus iangle they  and demen and deuyse
Til that the kyng  gan fro the bord arise
 Phebus hath lost  the angle mediornal
And ȝet ascendyng  was the best roial
The gentil leon  with his aldiran
Whan that this tartre kyng  Cambyuscan
Ros fro his bord  there as he sat ful heye
Bifore him goth  the loude mynstralcye
Til he come to his chambre  of parementȝ
There as there sounen  diuerse Instrumentȝ
That it is like an heuene  for to here
Now dauncen lusty venus  children dere
ffor in the ffissh  here lady sat ful heye
And loketh on hem  with a frendlich eye
This noble kyng  is set vpon his Trone
This straunge knyght  is to him fet ful sone
 And on the daunce he goth  with Canacee
here is the reuel  and the Iolitee
That is nat able  a dul man to deuyse
he must han knowen loue  and his seruyse
And ben a feestlich man  as fressh as May
That shulde ȝow deuysen  swich aray
who coude telle ȝow  the fourrme of daunces
So vncouth  and swich fressh countenaunces
Swich subtil lokyng  and dissimulynges
ffor drede  of gelous mennes  aparceyuynges
Noman but launcelot  and he is ded
Therfore I passe  of al this lustied


I sey no more  but in this Iolynesse
I lete hem  til men to the Soper dresse
The Styward  bit spices for to hye
And eke the wyn  and al this melodye
The vsshers  and the Squyery is gon
The spices and the wyn  is come anon
They ete and drynke  and whan this had an ende
vnto the temple  as reson was  they wende
 The seruyse don they  and soupen al be day
what nedeth to ȝow  rehercen here  here array
Eche man wot wel  that a kynges fest
Hath plentee to the meest  and to the leest
And deyntes moo than ben  in my knowyng  
At after soper  goth this noble kyng
To sen this hors  of Bras  with al a route
Of ladyes  and of lordes  him aboute
 Swich wondryng was there  on this hors of Bras
That syn the gret assege  of Troie was
There as men wondred  on an hors also
Ne was there swich a wondryng  as was tho
But fynaly  the kyng axed the knyght
The vertu of this courser  and the myght
And preyed him to telle  his gouernaunce
This hors anon  gan for to trippe and daunce
whan that the knyght  leid hand vpon his reyne
And seide sire  there nys no more to seyne
But whan ȝow list  to riden any where
Ȝe moten trille a pyn  stant in his Ere
which I shal tellen ȝow  betwixe vs two
Ȝe moten nempne him  to what place also
Or to what contre  that ȝow list to ryde
And whan ȝe come there  as ȝow list abide
Bid him decende  and trille an other pyn
ffor þereInne lith the effect  of al the gyn
And he wol doun decende  and don ȝoure wille
And in that place  he wol abyden stille


Though al the world  the contrarie had swore
he shal nat thens be drawe  ne be bore
Or if ȝow list  to bidde him  thens gon
Trille this pyn  and he wol vanysshe anon
Out of the sight  of euery manere wyght
And come ageyn  be it day or nyght
whan that ȝow list  to clepen him ageyn
In swich a gyse  as I shal to ȝow seyn
Betwixen ȝow and me  and that ful sone
Ryde whan ȝow list  there is no more to done
 Enformed whan the kyng was  of this knyght
And hath conceyued  in his wyt aright
The manere and the fourme  of al this thyng
fful glad and blithe  this noble lusty kyng
Repaireth to his reuel  as byforn
The brydel is  into the Tour Iborn
And kept among his Iueles  lief and deere
The hors vanysshed  I not in which manere
Out of here sight  ȝe gete no more for me
But thus I leete  in lust and Iolitee
This Cambyuscan  his lordes festeiynge
Til wel neygh  the day bygan to springe  
The norice of digestion  the sleep
Gan on hem wynke  and bad hem taken kep
That mechel drynk and labour  wyl haue rest
And with a galpyng mouth  hem alle he kest
And seide that it was tyme  to lye adoun
ffor blod was  in his dominacion
Cherisheth blood  natures frend quod he
They thanked him galpyng  by two by three
And euery wyght  gan drawe him to his rest
As sleep hem bad  they toke it for the best


here dremes shuln nat now  ben tolde for me
fful were here hedes  of fumositee
That causeth dreem  of which there is no charge
They slepe  til that it was  prime large
The moste parte  but it were Canacee
She was ful mesurable  as wommen be
ffor of hire fader  had she taken leue
To gon to rest  sone after it was eue
hire list nat appalled  for to be
Ne on the morwe  vnfestliche for to se
And slept hire first sleep  and thanne awoke
ffor swich a ioie  she in hire hert toke
Bothe of hire queynt Ryng  and hire Mirour
That twenty tyme  she chaunged hire colour
And in hire sleep  right for the inpression
Of hire Mirour  she had a vision
wherfore  er that the sonne  gan vp glyde
She cleped vpon hire Maistres  hire beside
And seide  that hire list for to ryse
Theise olde wommen  that ben gladly wyse
As is hire Maistresse  answered anon
And seide Madame  whider wolde ȝe gon
Thus erly  for the folk ben alle in rest
I wil quod she arrisen  for me lest
No lengere for to slepe  and walke aboute
hire Maistresse clepeth wommen  a gret route
And vp they risen  wel an ten or twelue
vp riseth fressh Canacee  hire selue
As rody and bright  as doth the ȝonge Sonne
That in the Ram  is foure degrees vp ronne
Non heighere was he  whan she redy was
And forth she walketh  esily a paas
Arrayed after the lusty seson  swote
lightly for to pleye  and walke on foote
Nat but with fyue or sexe  of hire meyne  
And in a trenche  forth in the Park goth she


 The vapor  which  that from the erthe glode
Made the Sonne to seme  rody and brode
But nathelees it was  so fair a sight
That it made alle here hertes  for to light
What for the Seson  and the morwenyng
What for the foules  that she herd syng
ffor right anon  she wist what they ment
Right by here song  and knew al here entent
 The knotte why  that euery tale is told
If it be taried  til the lust be cold
Of hem  that after it  han herkened ȝore
The sauour passeth  euere lengere the more
ffor fulsumnesse  of his prolixitee
And by this same reson  thynketh me
I shulde vnto the knot  condescende
And maken of here walkyng  sone an ende
 Amydde a tree ful drye  as white as chalk
As Canace was pleiyng  in hire walk
There sat a faucon  ouer hire hed ful heye
That with a pitous voice  so gan to crye
That al the wode  resouned of hire cry
Ibetyn had she hire self  so pitously
with bothe hire wenges  til the red blod
Ran endelong the tree  there as she stood
And euere in on alwey  she cried and shright
And with hire beek  hire seluen she so twight
That there nas tygre  ne so cruel beste
That dwelleth either in wode  or in foreste
That nolde han wept  if that he wepe coude
ffor sorwe of hire  she shright alwey so loude
 ffor þere was neuere ȝet  no man alyue
If that I coude  a faucon wel discryue
That herd of swich an other  of fairnesse
As wel of plumage  as of gentilnesse
Of shap  of al that myght Irekened be
A faucon peregryn  than semed she


Of fremd land  and eueremo there she stod
She swoughned now and now  for lakke of blood
Til wol ny is she fallen  fro the Tree
This faire kynges doughter  Canacee
That on hire fyngre  bare the queynt Ryng
Thurgh which  she vnderstod wel  euery thyng
That any foul  may in his ledne seyn
And coude answere him  in his ledne ageyn  
hath vnderstonden  what this faucon seide
And wel neigh for the routhe  almest she deiede
And to the tree  she goth ful hastily
And on this faucon  loketh pytously
And held hire lappe abrod  for wel she wiste
The faucon must fallen  fro the twiste
when that it swoughneth next  for lak of blood
A longe while  to wayten hire she stood
Til at the laste  she spak in this manere
vnto the hauke  as ȝe shuln after heere
what is the cause  if that it be to telle
That ȝe ben  in this furyal peyne of helle
Quod Canacee  vnto this hauke aboue
Is this for sorwe of deth  or losse of loue
ffor as I trowe  theise ben causes two
That causen moost  a gentil herte woo
Of other harm  it nedeth nat to speke
ffor ȝe ȝoure self  vpon ȝoure self ȝow wreke
which preeueth wel  that either Ire or drede
Mote ben encheson  of ȝoure cruel dede
Syn that I se  noon other wyght  ȝow chace
ffor loue of god  as doth ȝoure seluen grace
Or what may ben ȝoure helpe  for west north est
Ne saw I neuere or now  no bryd nor beest
That ferde with him self  so pitously
Ȝe slee me with ȝoure sorwe  verreyly
I haue of ȝow  so gret compassion
ffor goddes loue  come fro the tree adoun


And as I am  a kynges doughter trewe
If that I verreyly  the causes knewe
Of ȝoure dissese  if it lay in my myght
I wolde amende it  or that it were nyght
As wisly helpe me  gret god of kynde
And herbes shal I  right Inowe fynde
To hele with ȝoure hurtes  hastily
Tho shright this faucon  ȝet more pitously
Than euere she dide  and fel to grounde anon
And lith aswoughne  as ded as lith a ston
Til Canacee  hath in hire lappe  hire take
Into that tyme  she gan of swough awake
And after that  she of swouȝnyng gan abreyde
Right in hire haukes ledne  thus she seide
 That pitee renneth sone  in gentil herte
ffelyng his similitude  in peynes smerte
Is preeued al day  as men moun it se
As wel by werk  as by auctoritee  
ffor gentil herte  kitheth gentillesse
I se wel ȝe han  of my distresse
Compassion  my faire Canacee
Of verray wommanly  benygnetee
That nature  in ȝoure principiis hath set
But for non hope  for to fare the bet
But for to obeye  vnto ȝoure herte free
And for to maken othere  Iwar by me
As by the whelp  is chastised the leon
Right for that cause  and that conclusion
whil that I haue a leiser  and a space
Myn harm I wil confessen  or I pace
And whil that oon  hire sorwe tolde
That other wep  as she to water wolde
Til that the faucon  bad hire to be stille
And with a syke  right thus she seide hire wylle
 There I was bred  allas that ilke day
An forstred in a roche  of marbel gray


So tenderly  that no thyng eyled me
I nyst nat  what was aduersitee
Til I coude flee  ful heigh vnder the sky
Tho dwelled a Tercelet  me fast by
That semed welle  of al gentillesse
Al were he ful of treson  and falsnesse
It was so wrapped  vnder humble chere
And vnder hew of trouthe  in such manere
vnder plesaunce  and vnder besy peyne
That no wyght wold han wend  he coude feyne
So diep in greyn  he dyed hise colours
Right as a serpent  hideth vnder floures
Til he may sen his tyme  for to byte
Right so  this god of loues ypocrite
Doth his sermouns  and obeisaunces
And kepeth in semblaunt  alle his obseruaunces
That sovneth into gentillesse  of loue
As on a Toumbe  is al the fair aboue
And vnder is the cors  swich as ȝe wote
Swich was this ypocrite  bothe cold and hote
And in this wyse  he serued his entente
That saue the fend  noon wist what he ment
Til he so longe had weped  and compleyned
And many ȝere  his seruyse to me feyned
Til that myn herte  to pitous and to nyce
Al Innocent  of his crowned malice
So fered of his deth  as thought me
vpon hise othes  and on his seurtee  
Graunted him loue  on this condicion
That euere mo  myn honour and renoun
were saued  bothe pryue and apert
This is to seyn  that after his desert
I ȝaf him al myn hert  and al my thought
God wot and he  that other weyes nought
And toke his herte  in chaunge of myn for ay
But soth is seide  gon sithen many a day


A trewe wyght and a thef  thynke nat on
 And whan he sey the thyng  so fer Igon
That I had graunted him  fully my loue
In swich a gyse  as I haue seid aboue
And ȝeuen him  my trewe herte  as free
As he swore  that he ȝaf his herte to me
Anon this Tigre  ful of doublenesse
ffel on his knees  with so deuout humblesse
with so heigh reuerence  as by his chere
So like a gentil louere  of manere
So rauysshed  as it semed for the ioye
That neuere Iason  or Paris of Troye
Iason certes  ne non other man
Syn lameth was  that alderfirst bygan
To louen two  as wryten folk byforn
Ne neuere syn  the first man was born
Ne coude man  by twenty thousand parte
Countrefete the sophimes  of his arte
Ne were worthy  don bokelyn his galoche
There doublenesse or feynyng  shulde approche
Ne so coude thanke a wyght  as he did me
his manere was an heuene  for to se
To any womman  were she neuere so wys
So peynted he and kempt  at poynt deuys
As wel hise wordes  as his countenaunce
And so loued him  for his obeisaunce
And for the trouthe  I demed in his herte
That if so were  that any thyng him smerte
Al were it neuere so lite  and I it wiste
Me thought I felt deth  myn herte twiste
And shortly so ferforth  this thyng is wente
That my wyl was  his willes Instrumente
This is to seyn  my wyl obeyed his wille
In alle thynge  as fer as reson fille
kepyng the boundes  of my worship euere
Ne neuere hadde I thyng  so lief ne leuere


As hym god woot  ne neuere shal no moo  
This last lengere  than a ȝer or twoo
That I supposed of him  nought but good
But fynally  thus at the laste it stod
That fortune wolde  that he must twynne
Out of that place  which that I was Inne
where me was woo  that is no question
I can nat make of it  discripcion
ffor oo thyng dar I tellen  boldely
I knowe what is the peyne of deth  therby
Swich harm I felt  for he ne myght byleue
So on a day of me  he tok his leue
So sorweful eke  that I wende verreily
That he had felt  as muchel harm as I
whan that I herd him speke  and saugh his hewe
But natheles I thought  he was so trewe
And eke that he repeire  shulde ageyn
withInne a litel tyme  soth to seyn
And reson wolde eke  that he must go
ffor his honour  as often happeth so
That I made vertu  of necessite
And toke it wel  syn that it must be
As I best myght  I hidde fro him my sorwe
And tok him by the hand  Seynt Iohn to borwe
And seide him thus  I am ȝowres al
Beth swich as I to ȝow  haue ben and shal
what he answered  it nedeth nat reherce
who can seyn bet  than he  and don werse
whan he hath al wel seid  than hath he don
Therfore byhoued hire  a ful long spon
That shal ete with the fend  thus herd I seye
So at the laste  he must forth his weye
And forth he fleeth  til he come þere him luste
 Whan it come him to purpos  for to reste
I trowe that he hadde  thilke text in mynde
That al thyng  repairyng to his kynde


Gladeth him self  thus seyn men as I gesse
Men louen of propre kynde  newfangelnesse
As briddes don  that men in kages fede
ffor though thow nyght and day  take of hem hede
And strowe here cage  as faire and softe as sylk
And ȝeue hem sugre  hony bred and mylk
Ȝet right anon  as that his dore is vppe
he with his feet  wol spurne doun his cuppe
And to the wode he wole  and wormes ete
So newefongel ben they  of here mete  
And louen nouelries  of propre kynde
No gentillesse of blod  ne may hem bynde
So ferde this Tercelet  allas that day
Though he were gentil born  and fressh and gay
And goodlich for to sen  and humble and free
he sey vpon a tyme  a kyte flee
And sodeynly  he loued  this kyte so
That al his loue  is clene fro me ago
And hath his trouthe Ifalsed  in this wyse
Thus hath the kyte my loue  in hire seruyse
And I am born  withouten remedie
And with that word  this faucon gan to crie
And swoughned eft  in Canacees barm
 Gret was the sorwe  for the haukes harm
That Canacee  and alle hire wommen made
They nyste how they myghte  the faucon glade
But Canacee hom bereth hire  in hire lappe
And softly in plaistris  gan hire wrappe
There as she with hire hook  had hurt hire selue
Now can nat Canacee  but herbes delue
Out of the ground  and make salues newe
Of herbes preciouse  and fyne of hewe
To helen with this hauke  fro day to nyght
She doth hire besynesse  with al hire myght
And by hire beddes hed  she mad a Mewe
And couered it  with veluettes blewe


In signe of trouthe  that is in wommen sene
And al withoute the Mewe  is peynted grene
In which were peynted  alle theise false foules
As ben theise Tidifs  Tercellettes and Oules
Right for despit  were peynted hem beside
And Pies on hem  for to crie and chide
That lete I Canacee  hire hauke kepyng
I wol no more as now  speke of hire Ryng
Til it come eft to purpos  for to seyn
how that this faucon  gat hire loue ageyn
Repentaunt  as the story telleth vs
By mediacion  of Kambalus
The kynges sone  of which that I ȝow tolde
But hensforth  I wol my processe holde
To speke of auentures  and of batailles
That neuere ȝet was herd  so greete meruailles
ffirst wol I telle ȝow  of Cambyuscan
That in his tyme  many a citee wan
And after wol I speke  of Algerlif
how that he wan  Theodera to his wif
ffor whom ful ofte  in gret perile he was  
Ne had he ben holpen  by the Steede of Bras
And after wol I speken  of Kambalo
That faught in listes  with the bretheren two
ffor Canacee  or that he myght hire wynne
And there I lefte  I wil aȝein begynne
In feiþ Squyer  þu hast þe wele yquytte
And gentilly  I preise wele thy witte
Koþ þe ffrankeleyn  consideryng þy youthee
So felyngly þou spekest  sir I the alough þe
As to my dome  þere is none that is here
Of elloquence  þat shall be þy pere
Yf þat þou lyve  god yeue þe gode chaunce
And in vertue  send the contynuaunce
For of thy speche  I haue grete deynte  
I haue a son  and by þe Trinitee
I hade leuer  þan xxli worþ lond
Though it right now  were fall in myn hond
He were a man  of soch discrescioun
As þat ye ben  fye on possessioun
But yf a man  be vertuous withall 
I haue my son subbed  and yitte shall
ffor he to vertue  listeth nat to entende
But for to pley at Dys  and dispende
And lese all þat he hath  is his vsage
And he hath leuer  talken with a page
Than to commoun  with ony gentle wight
Where he myght lerne  gentilnes aright
Strawe for gentilnes  koth our Hoost
What ffrankeleyn  parde sir wele þou wost
That ecch of you  mot tellen atte leest
A tale or two  or breke his heest
That knowe I wele sir  koth þe ffrankeleyn
I pray you haueth me nat  in disdeyn


Though to this man  I speke a word or two
Tell on thy tale without  wordes mo 
Gladly sir hoost koth he  I woll obeye
Vnto your will  now herkeneth what I seye
I woll you nat contrarie in no wise
As fer þat  all my wittes wollen suffise
I pray to god  þat it may plesen you
Than wote I wele  þat it is gode ynow
Thise old gentle Bretons  in her dayes
Of diuers auentures  maden layes
Romaunced in her first bretons tung
Which laies  with her Instrumentes þey song
Or els reden hem  for her plesaunce
And one of hem  haue I in remembraunce
Which I shall seyn  with gode will  as I can  
But sires  bycause I am a borell man
At my begynnyng first I you beseche
Haue me excused of my rude speche
I lerned neuer retoryk certeyn
Thyng þat I speke  mot be bare and pleyn
I slepe neuere on the mount of parnaso
Ne lerned neuer Marcus Tullyus Sythero
Colours ne knowe I noon  without drede
But soch colours  þat growen in the mede
Or els soch as men dye  or peynt
Colours of Rethoryk ben to me queynt
My spirit feleth nat of soch matere
But yf you list my tale shull ye here
IN Amoryk þat called is Bretayne
There was a knyght  þat loued and did his peyne
To serue a lady  in his best wise
And many a labour  many a grete emprise


He for his lady wrought or she were won
ffor she was one  þe fairest vnder son
And eke þereto come  of so high kynrede
That well vnethes durst þis knyght for drede
Tell hir his wo  his peyn  and his distresse
But at þe last  she for his worthynesse
And namely  for his meke obeysaunce
Hath soch a Pite caught of his penaunce
That priuely  she fell of his accorde
To take hym  for hir housbond and hir lord
Of soch lordshipe  as men  han of her wyfes
And for to lede the more in blys  her lyfes
Of his free will  he swore hir  as a knyght
That neuer in all his lyue  he day ne night
Ne shold vpon hym take  no maistrie
Ageyn hir will  ne kithe hir ielousye
But hir obeye  and folow hir will in all
As ony louer  vnto his lady shall
Saue þat the name of soueraintee
That wold he haue  for shame of his degree
She thanked hym and with full grete Humblesse
She seide sire  sithe of ȝoure gentillesse
Ȝe profre me  to haue so large a reyne
Ne wolde neuere god  bytwixte vs tweyne
As in my gilt  were either werre or strif
Sire  I wil be ȝoure humble  trewe wyf
haue here my trouthe  til that myn herte breste
Thus ben they bothe  in quiete and in reste
 ffor oo thyng sires  safly dar I seye
That frendes  euerich other  mot obeye
If they wiln longe  holden compaignye
loue wol nat be constreyned  by maistrye
Whan maistre cometh  god of loue anoon
Beteth hise wynges  and farewel he is gon
loue is a thyng  as any spirit free
Wommen of kynde  desiren libertee


And nat to be constreyned  as a thral
And so doon men  If I sooth seyn  shal
loke who that most  is pacient in loue
he is at his auauntage  al aboue
Pacience  is an heigh vertu  certeyn
ffor it venquyssheth  alle theise clerkes seyn
Thynges  that rigour shulde neuere ateyne
ffor euery word  men moun nat chide or pleyne
Lerneth to suffre  or elles so mot I gon
Ȝe shuln it lerne  wheiþer so ȝe wol or noon
ffor in this world certeyn  there no wyght is
That he ne doth or seith  somtyme amys
Ire  sykenesse  or constellacion
Wyn  woo  or chaungyng of complexion
Causeth ful ofte  to don amys or spekyn
On euery wrong  a man may nat be wrekyn
After the tyme  must be temperaunce
To euery wyght  that can on gouernaunce
And therfore hath  this wys worthy knyght
To lyue in ease  suffraunce hire behight
And she to him  ful wysly gan to swere
That neuere shulde there be  defaute in hire
 heere moun men sen  an humble wys accord
Thus hath she take hire seruaunt  and hire lord
Seruaunt in loue  and lord in mariage
Thanne was he  bothe in lordshipe  and seruage
Seruage nay  but in lordshipe aboue
Sithe he hath bothe  his lady and his loue
His lady certes  and his wyf also  
To which  that lawe of loue  accordeth to
And whan he was  in this prosperitee
hoom with his wyf  he gooth to his contree
Nat fer fro Pedmarke  there his dwellyng was
Where as he lyueth  in blisse and in solas
 Who coude telle  but he had wedded be
The ioye  the ese  and the prosperitee


That is bytwixte  an husbonde  and his wyf
A ȝere and more  lasteth this blisful lif
Til that the knyght  of which I speke of thus
That of kairud  was cleped Arueregus
Shoope him to gon  and dwelled a ȝere or tweyne
In Engelond  that cleped was eke Bretaigne
To seke in armes  worshipe and honour
ffor al his lust  he sette in swich labour
And dwelled there  the ȝere  the book seith thus
 Now wol I stynten  of this Arueragus
And speken I wol  of Dorigen his wif
That loueth hire husbonde  as hire hertes lyf
ffor his absence  wepeth she and syketh
As doon theise noble wyues  whan hem liketh
She morneth  waketh  wayleth  fasteth  pleyneth
Desire of his presence  hire so destreyneth
That al this wyde world  she sette at nought
hire frendes  which that knewe  hire heuy thought
Conforten hire  in al that euere they may
They prechen hire  they tellen hire  nyght and day
That causelees  she sleth hire self  allas
And euery confort  possible in this cas
They don to hire  with al here besynesse
Al for to make hire leue  hire heuynesse
 By processe  as ȝe knowen euerychon
Men moun so longe  grauen in a ston
Til som figure  therInne empreynted be
So longe han they  conforted hire  til she
Receyued hath  by hope and by reson
The empryntynge  of hire consolacion
Thurgh which  hire gret sorwe  gan aswage
She may nat alwey duren  in swich rage
 And eke Arueragus  in al this care
hath sent hire lettres hom  of his welfare
And that he wol come hastily  ageyn
Or elles had this sorwe  hire hert slayn


 hire frendes saugh  hire sorwe gan to slake
And preyeden hire on knees  for goddes sake  
To come and romen hire  in compaignye
Awey to dryue  hire derk fantasie
And finally she graunted  that requeste
ffor wel she saugh  that it was for the beste
 Now stood hire Castel  fast by the see
And often with hire frendes  walketh she
hire to disporte  vpon the banke an heigh
Whereas she many a ship  and barge seigh
Seylyng here cours  where as hem list to goo
But thanne was that  a parcel of hire woo
ffor to hire self  ful ofte allas seith she
Is there no ship  of so manye as I se
Wil bryngen hom my lord  thanne were myn herte
Al warisshed  of hise bittre peynes smerte
 Another tyme  there wold she sitte and thynke
And cast hire eighen  dounward fro the brynke
But whan she seigh  the grisly Rokkes blake
ffor verrey fere  so wold hire hert quake
That on hire feet  she myght hire nought sustene
Than wolde she sitte adoun  vpon the grene
And pitously  into the See byholde
And seyn right thus  with sorweful sikes colde
Eterne god  that thurgh thy purueaunce
ledest the world  by eterne gouernaunce
In ydel as men seyn  ȝe no thyng make
But lord theise grisly  fendly rokkes blake
That semen rather  a foul confusion
Of werk  than any fair  creacioun
Of swich a parfyt wys god  and a stable
Why han ȝe wrought this werk  vnresonable
ffor by this werk  South  North  West ne Est
Ther nys Ifostred no man  ne bryd ne beest
It dooth no good  to my wytte  but annoyeth
Se ȝe nat lord  how mankynde it destroyeth


An hundred thouȝsand bodyes  of mankynde
han Rokkes slayn  al be they nought in mynde
Which mankynde is so faire  a part of thy werke
That thow it madest  like to thyn owen merke
Thanne semed it  ȝe had a gret chierte
Toward mankynde  but how thanne may it be
That ȝe swich menes make  it to destroyen
Which menes do no good  but euere annoyen
I wot wel  clerkes wiln seyn as hem lest
By argumenteȝ that al is for the best  
Though I ne can the causes  nought Iknowe
But thilke god  that made wynd to blowe
As kepe my lord  this is myn conclusion
To clerkes lete I  al disputisioun
But wolde god  that alle theise Rokkes blake
Were sonken into helle  for his sake
Theise Rokkes slen myn herte  for the fere
Thus she seide  with many a pytous tere
hire frendes saugh  that it was no disport
To romen by the See  but discomfort
And shopen for to pleyen  somwher elles
They leddyn hire by Ryuers  and by welles
And eke in othere places  delitables
They dauncen  and they pleyen at chesse  and tables
 So on a day  right in the morwe tyde
vnto a gardeyn  that was there beside
In which they had mad  here ordinaunce
Of vitaille  and of other purueaunce
They gon and pleye hem  al the longe day
And this was on the sexte morwe  of May
Which May had peynted  with his softe shoures
This gardeyn ful of leues  and of floures
And craft of mannys hand  so curiously
Arrayed had this gardeyn  trewely
That neuere was there gardyn  of swich a prys
But if it were  the verray Paradys


The odour of floures  and the fressh sight
Wolde han maked  any hert light
That euere was born  but if to gret sykenesse
Or to gret sorwe  helde it in destresse
So ful it was of beaute  with plesaunce
At after dyner  gonne they to daunce
And synge also  saue Dorigen allone
Which made alwey  hire compleynt and hire mone
ffor she ne saugh him  on the daunce goo
That was hire husbonde  and hire loue also
But nathelees  she must a tyme abyde
And with good hope  late hire sorwe slyde
 Vpon this daunce  amonges othere men
Daunced a Squyer  byfore Dorigen
That fresshere was  and Ioliere of array
As to my doom  than is the monthe of May
he syngeth  daunceth  passyng any man
That is  or was  sithe that the world bygan
Therewith he was  if men shulde him discryue  
On of the best faryng man  on lyue
Ȝong  strong  right vertuous  and riche and wys
And welbyloued  and holden in gret prys
And shortly  if the sothe  I tellen shal
vnwetyng of this  Dorigen at al
This lusty squyere  seruaunt to venus
Which that Icleped was  Aurelius
hadde loued hire best  of any creature
Two ȝere and more  as was his auenture
But neuere durst he tellen hire  his greuaunce
Withouten cuppe he drank  al his penaunce
he was dispeyred  nothyng durst he seye
Saue in hise songes  somwhat wolde he wreye
his woo  as in a gentil compleynyng
he seide he loued  and was byloued no thyng
Of which matere  made he many layes
Songes  compleyntes  roundels  virelayes


how that he durst nat  his sorwe telle
But languyssheth  as a fire doth in helle
And deye he must  he seide  as dide Ekko
ffor Narcisus  that durst nat telle hire wo
In othere manere  than ȝe heere me seye
Ne durst he nat to hire  his woo bewreye
Saue that perauenture  somtyme at daunces
There ȝonge folk kepen  here obseruaunces
It may wel be  he loked on hire face
In swych a wyse  as man that asketh grace
But no thyng wist she  of his entent
Nathelees it happed  er they thens went
Bycause that he was  hire neighebour
And was a man of worshipe and honour
And hadde Iknowen him  of tyme ȝore
They fel in speche  and forth more and more
vnto that purpos  drough Aurelius
And whan he saw his tyme  he seide thus
 Madame quod he  by god that this world made
If that I wiste  it myght ȝoure hert glade
I wolde that day  that ȝour Arueragus
Went ouer the see  that I Aurelius
hadde went  there neuere I shulde haue come ageyn
ffor wel I woot  my seruyse is in veyn
My gerdon is  but brestyng of myn herte
Madame  reweth vpon  my peynes smerte
ffor with a word  ȝe moun me slen or saue
Heere at ȝoure feet  god wolde that I were graue  
I ne haue as now  no leiser more to seye
haue mercy swete  or ȝe wol do me deye
 She gan to loke vp  on Aurelius
Is this ȝoure wil quod she  and seye ȝe thus
Neuere erst quod she  ne wist I what ȝe mente
But now Aurelie  I knowe ȝoure entente
By thilke god  that ȝaf me soule and lyf
Ne shal I neuere ben  an vntrewe wyf


In word ne werk  as fer as I haue wit
I wol ben his  to whom that I am knyt
Take this for fynal answere  as of me
But after that in pley  thus seide she
 Aurelie quod she  by heigh god aboue
Ȝet wolde I graunte ȝow  to ben ȝoure loue
Syn I ȝow se  so pitously compleigne
loke what day  endelong Britaigne
Ȝe remoue alle the Rokkes  ston by ston
That they ne lette ship  ne bot to gon
I seye whan ȝe han mad  the coost so clene
Of Rokkes  that there nys no stoon Isene
Thanne wol I loue ȝow best  of any man
haue heere my trouthe  in al that euere I can
 Is there non other grace in ȝow  quod he
No by that lord quod she  that maked me
ffor wel I wot  that it shal neuere betide
late swich folies  from ȝoure herte slide
What deynte  shulde a man han  in his lyf
ffor to go loue  another mannes wyf
That hath hire body  whan so þat him liketh
Aurelius ful ofte  sore siketh
 Woo was Aurelie  whan that he this herde
And with a sorweful hert  he thus answerde
Madame quod he  this were an inpossibile
Thanne moot I deye  of sodeyn deth possible
And with that word  he turned him anoon
Tho come hire othere frendes  many oon
And in the Aleyes  romeden vp and doun
And nothyng wisten  of this conclusion
But sodeynly bygonne  reuel newe
Til that the bright sonne  lost his hewe
ffor thorisonte hath reft  the sonne his light
This as meche to seye  as it was nyght
And hoom they gon  in Ioye and in solas
Saue oonly  wrecched Aurelius  Allas


He to his hous is gon  with sorweful herte  
he seeth he may nat  froo his deeth asterte
hym semed that he felt  his hert colde
vp to the heuene  hise hondes he gan holde
And on hise knees bare  he sette him doun
And in his rauyng  seide his orisoun
ffor werray woo  out of his wyt he breide
he nyste what he spak  but thus he seide
With pitous herte  his pleynt hath he bygonne
vnto the goddes  and first vnto the Sonne
 he seide Apollo  god and gouernour
Of euery plaunte  herbe  Tree and flour
That ȝeuest after  thy declynacion
To eche of hem  his tyme and his sesoun
As thyn herberwe chaungeth  lowe or heighe
lord Phebus  cast thy mercyable eye
On wrecched Aurelie  which that am but lorn
loo lord my lady  hath my deth Isworn
Withouten gilt  but thyn benygnetee
vpon my dedly hert  haue some pitee
ffor wel I woot  lord Phebus  if ȝow list
Ȝe moun me helpen  saue my lady best
Now vouchesaf  that I may ȝow deuyse
how that I may be holpen  and in what wyse
 Ȝoure blisful suster  lucyna the shene
That of the see  is chief goddes and quene
Though Neptunus  haue deitee in the see
Ȝet emperesse abouen him  is she
Ȝe knowen wel lord  that right as hire desire
Is to be quyked and lighted  of ȝoure fyre
ffor which she folweth ȝow  ful besily
Right to the see  desireth naturely
To folwen hire  as she that is goddesse
Bothe in the See  and Ryuers more and lesse
Wherfore lord Phebus  this is my requeste
Do this myracle  or do myn herte breste


That now next  at this apposicioun
which in the signe shal be  of the leoun
As preieth hire  so gret a flood to brynge
That fyue fadme at the leste  it ouer springe
The heieste Rokke  in armoryk Brytayne
And late this flode  endure ȝeres tweyne
Thanne certes to my lady  may I seye
haldeth ȝoure heste  the Rokkes ben aweye
 lord Phebus  do this myracle for me
Preye hire she go  no fastere cours than ȝe  
I seye  preieth ȝoure suster that she goo
No faster cours than ȝe  theise ȝeres twoo
Thanne shal she ben euene  at the fulle alwey
And spryng flood lastynge  bothe nyght and day
And but she vouchesaf  in swich manere
To graunte me  my souereigne lady deere
Preye hire to synken  euery Rokke adoun
Into hire owen derk  region
vnder the ground  there pluto dwelleth Inne
Or neuere moo shal I  my lady wynne
Thy temple in delphos  wol I barfot seke
lord Phebus  se the teeres on my cheke
And of my peyne  haue som compassion
And with that word  in sorwe he fel adoun
And longe tyme he lay forth  in a traunce
 his brother which that knew  of his penaunce
vp caughte him  and to bedde he hath him brought
Dispeired in this turment  and this thought
late I this wooful creature  lye
Chese he for me  wheiþer he wil lyue or dye
 Arueragus with hele  and gret honour
As he that was  of Chyualrie the flour
Is comen hom  and othere worthy men
O bliful artow now  thow Dorigen
That hast thy lusty housbonde  in thyne armes
The fresshe knyght  the worthy man of armes


That loueth the  as his owne hertes lyf
No thyng list him  to ben ymagnityf
If any wyght had spoke  whil he was oute
To hire of loue  he ne hadde of it  no doute
he nought entendeth  to no swich matere
But daunceth  Iusteth  maketh hire good chere
And thus in ioye and blisse  I late hem dwelle
And of the seke Aurelius  wol I telle
 In langour  and in turment furious
Two ȝere and more  lay wrecched Aurelius
Er any foot  he myght on erthe goon
Ne comfort in this tyme  had he noon
Saue of his brother  which that was a clerk
he knew of al this woo  and al this werk
ffor to noon other creature  certeyn
Of this matere  he durst no word seyn
vnder his brest  he bare it more secree
Than euere dide Pamphilus  for Galathee
his brest was hole  withoute for to sene
But in his herte  ay was the arwe kene  
And wel ȝe knowe  that of a sursanure
In surgerie  is perilous the cure
But men myght touche the arwe  or come therby
his brother weep  and wailed preuyly
Til at the laste  him fel in remembraunce
That whiles he was  at Orleens in fraunce
As ȝonge clerkes  that ben likerous
To reden artes  that ben curious
Seken in euery halke  and euery herne
Particulere sciences  for to lerne
he him remembred  that vpon a day
At Orliens  in studie  a book he say
Of magyk naturel  which his felawe
That was that tyme  a bacheler of lawe
Al were he there  to lerne another craft
hadde preuely  vpon his deske Ilaft


Which book spak muchel  of the operaciouns
Touchyng the xxviijty mansciouns
That longeth to the mone  and swich folie
As in our dayes  is nat worth a flie
ffor holichirche feith  in oure byleue
Ne suffreth noon illusion  vs to greue
And whan this book  was in his remembraunce
Anoon for ioye  his herte gan to daunce
And to him self  he seide priuely
My brother shal be warisshed  hastily
ffor I am syker  that there be sciences
By which men make  dyuerse apparences
Swich as theise subtile tregetoures  pleye
ffor ofte atte festes  haue I wel herd seye
That Tregetours  withInne an halle large
han made come in  a water and a barge
And in the halle  rowen vp and doun
Some tyme hath semed come  a grym leoun
And somtyme floures springe  as in a Mede
Somtyme a vyne and grapes  white and reede
Somtyme a castel  al of lyme and ston
And whan him lyked  voided it anoon
Thus semed it  to euery mannes sight
Now thanne conclude I thus  that if I myght
At Orliens  some olde felawe Ifynde
That hadde this mones mansiouns  in mynde
Or other magyk  naturel aboue
he shulde wel make my brother  haue his loue
ffor with an apparence  a Clerk may make
To mannes sight  that alle the Rokkes blake  
Of Britaygne  were Ivoided euerychon
And shippes by the brynke  come and gon
And in swich fourme  endure  a day or two
Thanne were my brother warisshede  of his woo
Thanne must she nedes holden  hire byheste
Or elles he shal shame hire  atte the leste


 What shulde I make  a lengere tale of this
vnto his brothers bed  he comen is
And swich confort  he ȝaf him for to gon
To Orliens  that he vp stirte anoon
And on his wey forthward  thanne is he fare
In hope for to ben lissed  of his care
 Whan they were come  almoost to that Citee
But if it were  a two forlong or three
A ȝonge Clerk romyng  by him self  they mette
Which that in latyn  thriftily hem grette
And after that he seide  a wonder thyng
I knowe quod he the cause  of ȝoure comyng
And er they ferthere  any foote wente
he told hem al that was  in here entente
 This Britoun Clerk  him asked of felawes
The which that he had knowe  in olde dawes
And he answered him  that they deede were
ffor which he wep ful ofte  many a teere
Doun of his hors  Aurelius light anoon
And with this Magicien  forth he is goon
hom to his hous  and maden hem wel att ese
hem lakked no vitaille  that myght hem plese
So wel arrayed hous  as there was oon
Aurelius in his lyf  saw neuere noon
he shewed him  er he wente to soupere
fforestes Parkes  ful of wylde dere
There saw he hertes  with here hornes heye
The grettest  that euere was seyn  with eye
he saw of hem  an hundred slayn with houndes
And some with arwes blede  of bittere woundes
 he saw whan voided were  the wilde deere
Theise faucons  vpon a fair Ryuere
That with here haukes  han the heroun slayn
Tho saw he knyghtes  Iustyng in a pleyn
And after this  he dide him swich plesaunce
That he him shewed  his lady on a daunce


On which him self he daunced  as him thought
And whan this Maister  that this Magyk wrought  
Saw it was tyme  he clapt hise handes two
And fare wel  al oure reuel was agoo
And remeeued they neuere  out of the hous
While they saugh  al this sight merueillous
But in his studie  there as hise bookes bee
They seten stille  but no wyght  but they three
To him this maister called  his squyere
And seide him thus  is redy oure soupere
Almost an houre it is  I vndertake
Sithe I ȝow bad  oure souper for to make
Whan that theise worthy men  wenten with me
Into my studie  there as my bookes be
 Sire quod this squyere  whan that it lyketh ȝow
It is al redy  though ȝe wol right now
Go we thanne soupe  quod he  for the beste
Theise amerous folk  somtyme mot han here reste
 At after souper  fel they in tretee
What somme  shulde this maistres  gerdoun be
To remeeuen alle the Rokkes  of Brytaigne
And eke from gerounde  to the mouth of sayne
he mad it straunge  and swor so god him saue
lasse than a thouȝsand pound  he wolde nat haue
Ne gladly for that somme  he wolde nat gon
Aurelius  with blisful herte anoon
Answered thus  fy on a thousand pound
This wide world  which that men seye is round
I wolde it ȝeue  if I were lord of it
This bargeyn is ful dreue  for we ben knyt
Ȝe shal be paid trewely  by my trouthe
But loketh now  for no necligence  or slouthe
Ȝe tarie vs heere  no lengere than tomorwe
Nay quod this Clerk  haue heere my feith to borwe
To bedde is gon Aurelius  whan him leste
And wel ny al that nyght  he had his reste


What for his labour  and his hope of blisse
his wooful herte  of penaunce had a lisse
 vpon the morwe  whan that it was day
To Britaigne toke they  the right way
Aurelius  and this Magicien byside
And ben descended  there they wolde abyde
And this was  as theise bookes me remembre
The colde frosty sesoun  of Decembre
 Phebus wex old  and hewed like latoun
That in his hote  declinacioun  
Shoon  as the burned gold  with stremes bright
But now in Capricorn  adoun he lyght
Whereas he shon ful pale  I dar wel seyn
The bittre frostes  with the sleet and reyn
Destroyed hath the grene  in euery ȝerd
Ianus syt by the fyre  with double berd
And drynketh of his bugle horn  the wyn
Biforn him stant Brawn  of the tusked swyn
And nowel crieth  euery lusty man
 Aurelius  in al that euere he can
Doth to this Maister  chiere and reuerence
And preieth him  to doon his diligence
To bryngen him  out of hise peynes smerte
Or with a swerd  that he wold slitte his herte
 This subtil clerk  swich routhe had of this man
That nyght and day  he spedde him that he can
To wayten a tyme  of his conclusioun
This is to seyn  to make illusioun
By swich an apparence  or Iogelrie
I ne can no termes  of Astrologie
That she and euery wyght  shulde wene and seye
That of Brytaigne  the Rokkes were aweye
Or elles they were sonken  vnder grounde
So at the laste  he hath his tyme Ifounde
To make his Iapes  and his wrechednesse
Of swich a supersticies  cursednesse


his tables tolletanes  forth he brought
fful wel corrected  ne there lakked nought
Neither his collect  ne his expans ȝeres
Ne hise rootes  ne hise othere geres
As ben hise centris  and hise argumenteȝ
And hise proporcionelles  conuenienteȝ
ffor hise equaciouns  in euery thyng
And by hise eighte spere  in his werkyng
he knew ful wel  how fer alnath was shoue
ffro the hed  of thilk fixe Aries aboue
That in the ix spere  considered is
fful subtilly  he kalculed al this
Whan he had founde  his first mansioun
he knewe the remenaunt  by proporcioun
And knew the arisyng  of his Mone wel
And in whos face and terme  and euerydel
And knewe ful wele  the Mones mansioun
Acordaunt  to his operacioun
And knew also  hise othere obseruaunces
ffor which illusions  and swich meschaunces  
As hethen folk vseden  in thilke dayes
ffor which no lengere  maketh he delayes
But thurgh his Magyk  for a weke or tweye
It semed  that alle the Rokkes  were aweye
 Aurelius  which that ȝet  despayred is
Wheither he shal han his lyf  or fare amys
Awayteth nyght and day  on this myracle
And whan he knew  that there was noon obstacle
That voided were theise Rokkes  euerychon
Doun to his maistres feet  he fel anoon
And seide  I wooful wrecched Aurelius
Thank ȝow lord  and lady myn  venus
That me han holpen  for my cares colde
And to the Temple  his weye  forth hath he holde
Where as he knew  he shulde his lady se
And whan he saugh his tyme  anoon right he


With dredful herte  and with humble chere
Salued hath  his souerayn lady dere
 My rightful lady  quod this wooful man
Whom I moost drede and loue  as I best can
And lothest were  of al this world  displese
Nere it that I  for ȝow haue swich dissese
That I must deyen heere  at ȝoure foot anoon
Nought wolde I telle  how me is woobygon
But certes  either must I dye or pleyne
Ȝe sleen me giltlees  for verray peyne
But of my deth  though that ȝe haue no routhe
Avyseth ȝow  er that ȝe breke ȝoure trouthe
Repenteth ȝow  for thilke god aboue
Or ȝe me sleen  bycause that I ȝow loue
ffor Madame wel ȝe woot  what ȝe han hight
Nat that I chalenge  any thyng of right
Of ȝow  my souerayn lady  but ȝoure grace
But in a gardeyn ȝonder  at swich a place
Ȝe wot right wel  what ȝe behighten me
And in myn hond  ȝoure treuthe plight ȝe
To loue me best  god wot ȝe seide so
Al be  that I vnworthy am therto
Madame  I speke it for the honour of ȝow
More than to saue  myn hertes lyf right now
I haue do so  as ȝe comaunded me
And if ȝe vouchesaf  ȝe may go se
Doth as ȝow list  haue ȝowre bihest in mynde  
ffor quykke or ded  right there ȝe shal me fynde
In ȝow lith al  to do me lyue or deye
But wel I woot  the Rokkes ben aweye
he taketh his leue  and she astoned stode
In al hire face  nas a drope of bloode
She wend neuere han come  in swich a trappe
 Allas quod she  that euere this shulde happe
ffor wende I neuere  by possibilitee
That such a moastre  or merueille myght be


It is ageyns  the processe of nature
And hom she goth  a sorweful creature
ffor verrey fere  vnethe may she goo
She wepeth weyleth  al a day or two
And swoughneth  that it reuthe was to se
But why it was  to no wyght told she
ffor ought of toune  was goon Arueragus
But to hire self she spak  and seide thus
With face pale  and with ful sorweful chere
In hire compleynte  as ȝe shuln after heere
Allas quod she  oon the fortune  I pleyne
That vnwar  wrapped hast me  in thy cheyne
ffro which to escape  woot I no socoure
Saue oonly deth  or ellis dishonoure
Oon of theise two  bihoueth me to chese
But nathelees  ȝet haue I leuere to lese
My lyf  than of my body haue a shame
Or knowe my seluen false  or lese my name
And with my deth  I may be quyte Iwys
hath there nat  many a noble wyf er this
And many a mayde  Islayn hire self  allas
Rather than with hire body  do trespas
 Ȝis certes  lo þeise stories beren wytnesse
Whan thretty Tyraunteȝ  ful of cursednesse
had slayn Phidon  in Athenes atte feste
They comaunded his doughtren  fort arreste
And bryngen hem biforn him  in despit
Al naked  to fulfille here foule delit
And in here fadres blod  they mad hem daunce
Vpon the pauement  god ȝeue hem myschaunce
ffor which theise wooful maydenes  ful of drede
Rathere than they wold lese  here maydenhede
They pryuely ben stirt  into a welle
And dreynt hem seluen  as the bookes telle
 They of Metene  lete enquere and seke
Of lacedomye  fifty maydenes eke


On which they wolden doon  here lecherie  
But was there noon  of al that companye
That she nas slayn  and with a good entente
Ches rather for to deye  than assente
To ben oppressed  of here maydenhede
Why shulde I thanne to dye  ben in drede
lo eke the Tiraunt  Aristoclides
That loued a mayden  hight Stymphalides
Whan that hire fader  slayn was  on a nyght
Vnto Dianes temple  gooth she right
And hente the ymage  in hire handes twoo
ffro which ymage  wold she neuere goo
 No wight ne myght  hire handes of it arrace
Til she was slayn  right in the selue place
Now sithe that maydenes  hadden swich despit
To ben defouled  with mannes foule delit
Wel ought I wyf  rather my seluen slee
Than be defouled  as it thynketh me
What shal I seyn  of Hasterubales wyf
That at Cartage  byrafte hire selue hire lif
ffor whan she saw  that Romeyns wan the Toun
She took hire children alle  and skipte adoun
Into the fire  and ches rathere to deye
Than any Romayn  dide hire velanye
 hath nat lucresse  Islayn hire self allas
At Rome  whan she oppressed was
Of Tarquyn  for hire thoughte it was a shame
To lyuen  whan she had lost hire name
 The Seuene Maydenes  of Melesie also
han slayn hem self  for verrey drede and woo
Rather than folk of Sawle  hem shulde oppresse
moo than a thousand stories  as I gesse
Coude I now telle  as touchyng this matere
 Whan habradate was slayn  his wyf so deere
hire seluen slow  and leet hire blood to glide
In habradeces woundes  depe and wyde


And seide my body  atte þe leste weye
There shal no wyght defoulen  if I maye
What shulde I moo ensaumples  hereof sayn
Sithe that so manye  han hem seluen slayn
Wel rathere than they wolde  defouled be
I wol conclude  that it is bet for me
To sleen my self  than be defouled thus
I wol be trewe  vnto Arueragus
Or rather slee my self  in some manere
As dide Democienis  doughter dere  
Bycause that she wolde nought  defouled be
 O Cedasus  it is ful greet pitee
To reden how thyne doughtren deyeden  allas
That slowen hem self  for suche manere cas
 As greet pitee was it  or wel more
The Theban Mayden  that for Nichamore
hire seluen slough  right for such manere woo
 Another Theban mayden  did right so
ffor oon of Macedoigne  had hire oppressed
She with hire deth  hire maydenhod redressed
 What shal I seyn  of Nycerates wyf
That for such cas  byrefte hir self hir lyf
 how trewe eke was  Alcebiades
his loue  that rathere for to dyen chees
Than for to suffre his body  vnberied be
 loo which a wyf  was Alceste quod she
 What seith Omere  of goode Penelopee
Al grece knoweth  of hire chastitee
 Parde of laodomia  is wryten thus
That whan at Troie  was slayn Protheselaus
No lengere wolde she lyue  after his day
 The same of noble Portia  telle I may
Withoute Brutus  coude she nat lyue
To whom she had al hool  hire herte ȝyue
 The parfyt wyfhod  of Arthemesye
honoured is  thorugh al the Barbarye


 O Theuta Quene  thy wyfly chastitee
To alle wyues  may a myrour be
    
    
Thus pleyned Dorigen  a day or tweye
Purposyng euere  that she wolde deye
But nathelees  vpon the thridde nyght
hoom come Arueragus  this worthy knyght
And axed hire  why that she wepe so sore
And she gan wepen  euere the lengere the more
Allas quod she  that euere was I born
Thus haue I seide quod she  thus haue I sworn
And told him al  as ȝe han herd byfore
It nedeth nat  reherce it ȝow no more
 This housbond with glad chere  and frendly wyse
Answered and seide  as I shal ȝow deuyse
Is there out elles  Dorigen but this
Nay nay quod she  god help me so as wys
This is to meche  and it were goddis wylle
Ye wyf koth he  let slepen that is still  
It may be wele  perauenture yitte today
ye shull your trouth hold by my fay
ffor god so wisly  haue mercy vpon me
I hade wele leuer  stikked for to be
For verray loue  which that I to you haue  
But yf  ye shold your trouth  kepe and save
Trouth is the hiest thyng  þat man may kepe
But with þat word he brast anon to wepe
And seid  I you forbede vpon peyn of deth
That neuer while you  lasteth lyf or breth
To no wight tell þou of this auenture
As I may best I woll my wo endure
Ne make no countenaunce  of hevynes
That folk of you  mow deme harme or gesse
And forth he cleped a squyer  and a meid
Goth forth anon  with Dorigen he seid


And bryng hir  to soch a place anoon
They take her leue  and on her wey þey gon
But þey ne wist why she theder went
He nold no wight tell his intent
    
    
    
    
    
    
This Squyer  which þat hight Aurelius
On Dorigen  that was so amerus
Of auenture  happed hir to mete
Amyd the toun  right in þe quykkest strete
And she was boun  to go the wey forth right
Toward the gardyn  there as she hade hight
And he was to þe  gardynward also
ffor wele he spied  whan she wold go
Out of hir hous  to ony maner place
But þus þey mette  of auenture or grace
And he salueth hir  with gode intent
And axed of hir  whiderward she went
And she answerd  half as she were mad
Vnto the gardyn as myn housbond bad
My trouth for to hold  Allas Allas
Aurelius gan wonder  on þis caas
And in his hert hade grete compassioun
Of hir  and hir lamentacioun
And of Arueragus  þe worthy knyght
That bade hir hold  all þat she hade hight
So loth hym was  his wif  shold breke hir treuth
And in his hert  he caught of þis grete reuth
Consideryng þe best  on euery side
That from his lust  yitte leuer were hym bide
Than don so heigh  a  cherlyssh wrecchednes  
Ayeinst  fraunchise  and all gentilles


ffor which in fewe wordes  seid he þus
Madame seith to your lord  Arueragus
That seth I se  his grete gentilles
To you  and eke  I se wele  your distres
That hym were leuer haue shame  and þat were reuth
Than ye to me  shold breke þus your treuth
I haue wele leuer euer to suffre wo
Than I depart the love  bitwene you two
I you relese madame  into your honde
Quyte euery surement And euery bonde
That ye han made  to me  as herebyforn
Seth thylk tyme  which þat ye were born
My trouth I plight I shall you neuer repreue
Of no byhest and here I take my leue
As of þe truest  and þe best wyf
That euer yitte  I knew in all my lyf
But euery wyf  be ware  of hir byhest
On Dorigen  remembreth atte lest
Thus can a Squyer don a gentle dede
As wele  as can a knyght without drede
She thanketh hym  vpon her knees bare
And home to hir housbond  is she fare
And told hym all  as ye han herd me seid
And be ye siker  he was so wele appeid
That it were impossible  me to write
What shold I lenger  of þis caas endite
Arueragus  and Dorigen his wyf
In souerayn blys  leden forth her lyf
Neuer eft  was þere angre  hem bitwene
He cherissheth hir  right as she were a quene
And she was to hym true  for euermore
Of thise ij folk  ye gete of me no more
Aurelius  þat his cost  hath all forlorn
Curseth the tyme  þat euer was he born
Allas koth he  allas that I behight
Of pured gold a Ml pound of wight


Vnto this Philisophre  how shall I do
I sey no more  but þat I am fordo
Myn heritage mot I nedes sell  
And ben a begger  here may I nat dwell
And shamen al my kynrede  in this place  
But I of hym  myght gete bettre grace
But nathelees  I wyl of hym assaye
At certeyne dayes  ȝere by ȝere to paye
And thanke him  of his grete curteisie
My trouthe wil I kepe  I wyl nought lye
 With herte sore  he gooth vnto his coffre
And brought gold  vnto his Philosophre
The value of fyue hundred pound  I gesse
And him bisecheth  of his gentillesse
To graunt him dayes  of the remenaunt
And seide Maister  I dar wel make auaunt
I failled neuere  of my trouthe  as ȝet
ffor sikerly my dette  shal be quyt
Towardes ȝow  how euere that I fare
To goon a begged  in my kirtel bare
But wolde ȝe vouchesauf  vpon seuretee
Two ȝere or thre  for to respiten me
Thanne were I wel  for elles mot I selle
Myn heritage  ther nys na more to telle
 This Philosophre  sobrely answerde
And seide thus  whan he theise wordes herde
haue I nat holden  couenaunt vnto the
 Ȝis certes  wel and trewely  quod he
hast thow nat had thy lady  as the liketh
 No no quod he  and sorwefully he syketh
What was the cause  telle me if thow can
 Aurelius his tale  anoon bygan
And told him al  as ȝe han herd bifore
It nedeth nat to ȝow  reherce it more
 he seide Arueragus  of gentillesse
hadde leuere dye  in sorwe and in distresse


Than that his wyf  were of hir trouthe fals
The sorwe of Dorigene  he told him als
how loth hire was  to ben a wykked wyf
And that she lost had leuere  that day  hir lyf
And that hir trouthe  she swor of Innocence
She neuere erst  had herd speke  of apparence
That mad him han of hire  so gret pitee
And right as freely  as he sent hir me
 sent I hire  to him ageyn
 some  ther nys na more to seyn
 hre  answerd leue brother
 dide gentilly to other
Thow art a Squyer  and he is a knyght  
But god forbede  for his blisful myght
But if a Clerk  coude doon a gentil dede
As wel as any of ȝow  it is no drede
 Sire I relesse the  thy thousand pound
As thow right now  were cropen out of the ground
Ne neuere er now  ne haddest knowen me
ffor sire  I wol nat take  a peny of the
ffor al my craft  ne nought for my trauaille
Thow hast Ipaid wel  for my vitaille
It is Inow  and farewel haue good day
And toke his hors  and forth he goth his wey
lordynges this question  than wil I axe now
Which was the moost free  as thynketh ȝow
Now telleth me  or that ȝe ferthere wende
I can namore  my tale is at an ende
There was as telleth Titus liuius
A knyght  that called was virginius
ffulfild of honour  and of worthynesse
And strong of frendes  and of gret richesse
This knyght a doughter hadde  by his wyf
No children hadde he moo  in al his lyf
ffair was this mayde  in excellent beautee
Abouen euery wyght  that man may se
ffor nature hath  with souereyne diligence
Iformed hire  in so gret excellence
As though she wolde seyn  lo I nature
Thus kan I forme  and peynte a creature
Whan that me list  who kan me countrefete
Pigmalion nought  though he ay forge and bete
Or graue  or peynte  for I dar wel seyn
Appelles ȝanȝis  shulde werche in veyn
Outher to graue  or peynte  or forge  or bete
If they presumeden  me to countrefete
ffor he that is  the fourmere principal
hath maked me  his vicaire general
To forme  and peynten  erthely creaturis
Right as me list  and ech thyng in my cure
vnder the moone  that may wane and waxe
And for my werk  right no thyng wol I axe    
My lord and I  ben ful of oon accord
I made hire  to the worshipe of my lord
So do I  alle myne othere  creatures
What colour that they han  or what figures
Thus semeth me  that nature wolde seye
This mayde of age  twelue ȝer was and tweye
In which that nature  hadde swich delit
ffor right as she kan peynte  a lilye whit
And reed as Rose  right with swich peynture
She peynted hath  this noble creature
Er she were born  vpoon hire lymes free
Where as by right  swich coloures shulde bee
And Phebus dyed hath  hire tresses grete
lyke to the stremes  of his burned hete
And if that excellent  was hir beaute
A thousand fold  moore vertuous was she
In hire ne lakked  no condicion
That is to preyse  as by discrecion
As wel in goost as body  chaast was she
ffor which she floured  in virginite
With alle humylite  and abstinence
With alle attemperance  and pacience
With mesure eke  of berynge and array
Discret she was  in answerynge alwey
Though she were wys Pallas  dar I seyn
hire facounde eke  ful wommanly and pleyn
Noo countrefeted termes  had she
To seme wys  but after hire degree
She spak  and alle hire wordes more and lesse
Sovnyng in vertu  and in gentillesse
Shamefast she was  in maydens shamefastnesse
Constant in herte  and euere in bisinesse
To dryue hir out  of ydel slogardye
Bacus had of hir mouth  right no maistrie
ffor wyn and ȝouthe  dooth venus encrees
As men in fyr  wol casten oille or grees
  
And of hire owene vertu  vnconstreyned
She hath ful ofte tyme syke  hir feyned
ffor that she wolde fleen  the compaignye
where likly was  to treten of folye
As is at festes  reuels  and at daunces
That ben occasiouns  of daliaunces
Swich thyng  maken children for to be
To sone rype  and bold as men moun se
Which is ful perilous  and hath be ȝoore  
ffor al to sone  moun they lerne loore
Of boldnesse  whan she woxen is a wyf
 And ȝe maistresses  in ȝoure olde lyf
That lordes doughtres  han in gouernaunce
Ne taketh of my wordes  no displesaunce
Thenketh that ȝe ben set  in gouernynges
Of lordes doughtres  oonly for two thynges
Outher for ȝe han kept  ȝoure honeste
Or elles ȝe han falle  in freelete
And knowen wel Inow  the olde daunce
And han forsaken fully  swich meschaunce
ffor euere moo  therfore for cristes sake
To teche hem vertu  loke that ȝe ne slake
 A thef of venyson  that hath forlaft
his likerousnesse  and al his olde craft
kan kepe a forest  best of any man
Now kepeth wel  for if ȝe wole ȝe kan
loke wel that ȝe  vnto no vice assente
leest ȝe be dampned  for ȝowre wykke entente
ffor who so doth  a traytour is certeyn
And taketh kepe  of that that I shal seyn
Of alle treson  souerayn pestilence
Is whan a wyght bitraiseth  Innocence
Ȝe fadres and ȝe modres  eke also
Though ȝe han children  be it on or moo
Ȝoure is the charge  of al hir surueaunce
Whil that they ben  vnder ȝoure gouernaunce
  
Beth war  if be ensaumple of ȝoure lyuynge
Or by ȝoure necligence  in chastisynge
That they perisshe  for I dar wel seye
If that they doon  ȝe shul it deere abeye
vnder a Shepherde  soft and necligent
The wolf  hath many a sheep and lamb torent
Suffiseth on ensample  now as heere
ffor I moot turne ageyn  to my matere
 This mayde  of which  I wol this tale expresse
So kept hir self  hir neded no Maistresse
ffor in hir lyuyng  maydens myghten rede
As in a book  euery good word  or dede
That longeth to a mayden  vertuous
She was so prudent  and so bountevous
ffor which the same out sprong  on euery syde
Bothe of hir beaute  and hire bounte wyde  
That thurgh that lond  they preised hir echone
That loued Vertu  saue Envye allone
That sory is  of oother mennes wele
And glad is of his sorwe  and his vnhele
The doctour  makith this discripcioun
This mayde vpon a day  went in the toun
Toward a temple  with hir moder deere
As is of ȝonge maydens  the manere
 Now was there thanne  a Iustice in that toun
That gouernour was  of that Regioun
And so bifel  this Iuge  his eyen caste
vpon this mayde  auysynge him ful faste
As she coom forby  there as this Iuge stod
Anoon his herte chaunged  and his mood
So was he caught  with beaute of this mayde
And to him self  ful pryuely he sayde
This mayde shal be myn  for any man
Anoon the fend  into his herte ran
And taughte him sodeynly  that he by sleighte
The mayden to his purpos  wynne myghte
  
ffor certes by no force  ne by no mede
him thoughte he was nat able  for to spede
ffor she was strong of frendes  and eke she
Confermed was  in swich souerayn bounte
That wel he wiste  he myght hir neuere wynne
As for to make hir  with hir body synne
ffor which  by greet deliberacioun
he sent after a cherl  was in the toun
Which that he knew  for subtil and for bold
This Iuge vnto this cherl  his tale hath told
In secree wyse  and maad him to ensure
he shulde telle it  to no creature
And if he dide  he shulde leese his hed
Whan that assented was  this cursed reed
Glad was this Iuge  and maked him gret chere
And ȝaf him ȝiftes  preciouse and deere
 Whan shapen was  al here conspiracye
ffro poynt to poynt  how that his lecherye
Parfourmed shulde ben  ful subtilly
As ȝe shuln heere it  after openly
 hom goth the cherl  that hight Claudyus
This fals Iuge  that hight Apius
So was his name  for this is no fable
But knowen for historial thyng  notable  
The sentence of it  soth is out of doute
This fals Iuge  goth now fast aboute
To hasten his delyt  al that he may
And so byfel  sone after on a day
This fals Iuge  as telleth vs the storie
As he was wont  sat in his Consistorie
And ȝaf his domes  vpon sondry cas
This fals Cherl cam forth  a ful gret pas
And seide lord  if that it be ȝoure wille
As doth me right  vpon this pitous bille
In which I pleyne  vpon virginius
And if that he wol seyn  it is nat thus
  
I wol it preeue  and fynde good wytnesse
That sooth is  that my bille  wol expresse
 This Iuge answered of this  in his absence
I may nat ȝeue  diffynytif sentence
lat do him calle  and I wol gladly heere
Thow shalt haue al right  and no wrong here
 virginius cam to wyte  the Iuges wille
And right anon was red  this cursed bille
The sentence of it  was as ȝe shuln heere
 To ȝow my lord sire Apius  so dere
Sheweth ȝoure pore seruaunt Claudius
how that a knyght  called virginius
Ageyns the lawe  ageyn al equytee
holdeth expres  ageyn the wyl of me
My seruaunt  which that is my thral by right
Which fro myn hous  was stolen vpon a nyght
Whil that she was ful ȝong  this wyl I preeue
By witnesse lord  so that it nat ȝow greue
She nys his doughter nat  what so he seye
Wherfore to ȝow my lord  the Iuge  I preye
Ȝelde me my thral  if that it be ȝoure wille
lo this was al  the sentence  of his bille
virginius gan  vpon the thral biholde
But hastily  or he his tale tolde
And wolde haue preued it  as shulde a knyght
And eke by wytnessynge  of many a wyght
That al was fals  that seide his aduersarie
This cursed Iuge  wolde no thyng tarie
Ne heere a word more  of virginius
But ȝaf his Iugement  and seide thus
 I deme anoon this cherl  his seruaunt haue
Thow shalt no lengere  in thyn hous hir saue
Go brynge hire forth  and put hire in oure warde  
The cherl shal han his thral  this I awarde
 And whan this worthy knyght  virginius
Thurgh sentence  of this Iustice Apius
  
Muste by force  his deere doughter ȝiuen
vnto the Iustice  in lecherye to lyuen
he goth him hom  and sette him in his halle
And leet anoon  his deere doughter calle
And with a face deed  as asshen colde
vpon hire humble face  he gan biholde
With fadres pitee  stikynge thurgh his herte
Al wolde he  from his purpos nat conuerte
 Doughter quod he  virginia by thy name
There ben two weyes  either deth or shame
That thow must suffre  allas that I was bore
ffor neuere thow deseruedest  wherfore
To dyen with a swerd  or with a knyf
O deere doughter  endere of my lyf
Which I haue fostred vp  with swich plesaunce
That thow were neuere  out of myn remembraunce
O doughter  which that art  my laste woo
And in my lif  my laste ioye also
O gemme of chastitee  in pacience
Take thow thy deth  for this is my sentence
ffor loue  and nat for hate  thow must be ded
My pitous hand  moot smyten of thyn hed
Allas  that euere Apius the say
Thus hath he falsly  Iuged the today
And told hire al the cas  as ȝe bifore
han herd  nat nedeth it  to telle it more
 O mercy deere fader  quod this mayde
And with that word  she bothe hir armes leyde
Aboute his nekke  as she was wont to doo
The teeris borst out  of hire eighen two
And seide  goode fader  shal I dye
Is there no grace  is þere no remedye
 No certes  deere doughter myn quod he
 Than ȝif me leiser  fader myn quod she
My deth for to compleyne  a litel space
ffor pardee  Iepte ȝaf his doughter grace  
ffor to compleyne  er he hir slow  allas
And god it woot  no thyng was hir trespas
But for she ran  hir fader first to se
To welcome him  with gret solempnytee
And with that word  she fel a swoughne anon  
And after  whan hire swoughnyng is agon
She riseth vp  and to hire fader seide
Blissed be god  that I shal dye a mayde
Ȝif me my deth  er that I haue a shame
Doth with ȝoure child  ȝoure wil  a goddes name
And with that word  she preieth him ful ofte
That with his swerd  he shulde smyte softe
And with that word  a swoughne doun she fil
hire fader  with ful sorweful herte  and wil
hir hed of smote  and by the top it hente
And to the Iuge  he gan it to presente
As he sat ȝet  in doom Consistorie
And whan the Iuge it saw  as seith the storie
he bad to take him  and anhange him faste
But right anoon  a thousand peeple in thraste
To saue the knyght  for routhe and for pitee
ffor knowen was  this fals Iniquitee
 The peeple anoon  hadden suspect in this thyng
By manere of the cherles  chalangyng
That it was by the assent  of Apius
They wisten wel  that he was lecherous
ffor which  vnto this Apius they gon
And cast him in a prison  right anoon
Where as he slow him self  and Claudyus
That seruaunt was  vnto this Apius
Was demed for to hange  vpon a tree
But that virginius  of his pitee
So preyed for him  that he was exiled
And elles certes  had he ben bigyled
The remenaunt were anhanged  moore and lesse
That were consentant  of this cursednesse
  
 heere moun men sen  how synne hath his merite
Beth war  for no man woot  whom god wol smyte
In no degree  ne in which manere wyse
The worm of conscience  may agryse
Of wykked lyf  though it so pryue be
That no man wot therof  but god and he
ffor he be lewed man  or elles lered
he noot howe sone  that he shal ben afered
Therfore I rede ȝow  this counsel take
fforsaketh synne  er synne ȝow forsake
Oure Hoost bygan to swere  as he were wood  
harrowe quod he  by nayles and by blood
This was a fals cherl  a false Iustise
As shameful deeth  as herte kan deuyse
Come to theise Iuges  and here Aduocates
Algate this sely mayde  is slayn  allas
Allas  to dere abought she hire beaute
Wherfore I seye alday  that men moun se
That ȝiftes of fortune  and of nature
Ben cause of deeth  to many a creature
    
    
Of bothe ȝiftes  that I speke of now
Men han ful ofte  more for harm than prow
 But trewely  myn owyn Maister deere
This is a pitous tale  for to heere
But nathelees  passe ouer  is no fors
I preye to god  so saue thy gentil cors
And eke thyne vrynals  and thyne Iurdones
Thyn ypocras  and eke thy Galiones
And euery boiste  ful of thy letuarie
God blisse hem  and oure lady Seynt Marie
So mote I then  thow art a propre man
And lyke a prelat  by Seynt Ronyan
Seyde I nat wel  I kan nat speke in terme
But wel I woot  thow doost myn herte to erme
That I almost haue caught  a Cardynacle
By Corpus bones  but I haue tryacle
Or elles a draught of moiste  and corny ale
Or but I heere anoon  a murie tale
  
Myn herte is loste  for pitee of this mayde
Thow beal amy  thow Pardoner he sayde
Telle vs sum myrthe  of Iapes right anoon
 It shal be don quod he  by Seynt Ronyon
But first quod he  heere at this Alestake
I wol bothe drynke and eten  of a Cake
But right anoon  theise gentils gonne to crie
Nay lat him nat telle vs  of no ribaudie
Telle vs som moral thyng  that we may lere
Some wyt  and thanne wol we gladly heere
I graunte Iwys quod he  but I must thynke
vpon som honest thyng  whil that I drynke

Lordynges quod he  in chirches whan I preche
I peyne me to haue  an hauteyn speche
And rynge out  as round  as gooth a belle
ffor I can al by rote  that I telle
ffirst I pronounce  whennes that I come
And thanne myne Bulles shewe I  alle and some
Oure liege lordes seel  on my patente
I shewe first  my body to warente
That no man be so bold  ne preest ne Clerk
Me to distourbe  of Cristes holy werk
And after that  than telle I forth my tales
Bulles of Popes  and of Cardynales
Of Patriarkes  and of Busshopes I shewe
And in latyn speke I  wordes fewe
To Saffron with  my predicacioun
In euery village  and in euery toun
This is my Teme  and shal  and euere was
Radix malorum  est Cupiditas
Thanne shewe I forth  my longe cristal stones
Icrammed ful of cloutes  and of bones
Relikes ben they  as wenen they ichon
Thanne haue I in a loton  a shulder bon
Which that was  of an holy Iewes sheep
Goode men I seye  take of my wordes keep
If that this bon  be wasshe in any welle
If Cow or Calf or Oxe  or sheep swelle
That any worm hath ete  or worm Istonge
Take water of that welle  and wasshe his tonge
  
And it is hool anoon  and forthere more
Of pokkes and of Scabbe  and euery sore
Shal euery sheep be hool  that of this welle
Drynketh a draughte  take kepe eke what I telle
If that the goode man  that the bestes oweth
Wol euery wyke  er that the Cok him croweth
ffastyng drynken  of this welle a draughte
As thilke holy Iew  our eldres taughte
his bestes and his stoor  shal multiplie
And sire also  it heleth Ialousie
ffor though a man be falle  in Ialous rage
lat maken with this water  his potage
And neuere shal he more his wyf mystriste
Though he the sothe  of hire defaute wiste
Al hadde she taken Preestes  two or thre
 heere is a Miteyn eke  that ȝe may se
He that his hond  wol putte in this Mitayn  
he shal haue multipliyng  of his grayn
Whan he hath sowen  be it whete or Otes
So that he offre pens  or ellis grotes
Goode men and wommen  oo thyng warne I ȝow
If any wight  be in this chirche now
That hath don synne horrible  that he
Dar nat for shame  of it Ishryuen be
Or any womman  be she ȝong or old
That hath Imaked  hire housbonde Cokewold
Swich folk shuln haue  no power ne no grace
To offren to my relikes  in this place
And who so fyndeth him  out of swich blame
They wol come vp  and offre a goddis name
And I assoille him  by the auctoritee
Which that by bulle  Igraunted was to me
 By this gaude  haue I wonne ȝer by ȝer
An hundred mark  sithe I was Pardoner
I stonde like a Clerk  in my pulpet
And whan the lewede peeple  is doun Iset
  
I preche so  as ȝe han herd bifore
And telle an hundred  false iapes more
Thanne peyne I me  to strecche forth the nekke
And Est and west  vpon the peeple I bekke
As doth a dowue  sittyng on a berne
Myn handes and my tonge  goon so ȝerne
That it is ioye  to seen my besynesse
Of auarice  and of swich cursednesse
Is al my prechyng  for to make hem free
To ȝeue here pens  and namely vnto me
ffor myn entente is nat  but for to wynne
And no thyng  for correccion of synne
I rekke neuere  whan that they ben beryed
Though that here soules  gon a blakeberyed
ffor certes  many a predicacion
Cometh ofte  of yuel entencion
Som for plesaunce of folk  and flaterie
To ben avaunced  by ypocrisye
And som for veyn glorie  and som for hate
ffor whan I dar  noon other weyes debate
Thanne wol I stynge him  with my tonge smerte
In prechyng  so that he  shal nat asterte
To ben defamed falsly  if that he
hath trespased  to myne bretheren or to me
ffor though I telle nought  his propre name  
Men shuln wel knowe  that it is the same
By signes  and by othere circumstaunces
Thus quyte I folk  that doon vs displesaunces
Thus spitte I out my venym  vnder hewe
Of holynease  to semen holy and trewe
But shortly  myn entente I wol deuyse
I preche of no thyng  but for coueytise
Therfore my teme is ȝet  and euere was
Radix malorum  est cupiditas
 Thus can I preche  ageyn that same vice
Which that I vse  and that is Auarice
  
But though my self  be gilty in that synne
Ȝet kan I maken  othere folk to twynne
ffrom Auarice  and sore to repente
But that is nat  my principal entente
I preche no thyng  but for coueitise
Of this matere  it oughte Inow suffise
 Thanne telle I hem  ensaumples many oon
Of olde stories  longe tyme agoon
ffor lewede peeple  louen tales olde
Swich thynges konne they  wel reporte and holde
What trowe ȝe  that whiles I may preche
And wynne gold and siluer  for I teche
That I wol lyue  in pouertee wilfully
Nay nay  I thought it neuere trewely
ffor I wol preche  and begge in sondry londes
I wol nought do no labour  with myne hondes
Ne make baskettes  and lyue therby
By cause  I wol nat beggen ydelly
I wol noone of the Apostles  countrefete
I wol haue moneye  wolle  Chese and whete
Al were it ȝeuen  of the poorest page
Or of the poorest wydewe  in a village
Al shulde hire children sterue  for famyne
Nay I wol drynke licour  of the vyne
And haue a ioly wenche  in euery toun
But herkeneth lordynges  in conclusioun
Ȝoure likyng is  that I shall telle a tale
Nowe haue I dronke  a draughte of corny Ale
By god I hope  I shal ȝow telle a thyng
That shal by reson  ben at ȝoure likyng
ffor though my self  be a ful vicious man
A moral tale  ȝet I ȝow telle can
Which I am wont to preche  for to wynne
Now holde ȝoure pees  my tale I wol bigynne

IN fflaundres whilom  was a compaignye  
Of ȝonge folk  that haunteden folye
As ryot hasard  Stewes and Tauernes
whereas with harpes  lutes and Gyternes
They daunce  and pleyen atte dees  bothe day and nyght
And ete also  and drynken ouer here myght
Thurgh which they doon  the deuele sacrifice
withInne that deueles temple  in cursid wyse
By superfluitee  abhominable
here othes ben so grete  and so dampnable
That it is grisly  for to here hem swere
Oure blissed lordes body  they toteere
hem thoughte  that Iewes rent him nought Inow
And ech of hem  at otheres synne low
And right anoon  than comen Tombesterys
ffetise and smale  and ȝonge ffrutesterys
Syngeris with harpes  Baudes  wafererys
which ben  the verray deueles officeris
To kyndele and blowe  the fir of lecherie
That is annexed  vnto Glotonye
The holy wryt take I  to my wytnesse
That luxurye  is in wyn  and dronkenesse
 lo how that dronken Loth  vnkendely
lay by hise doughtres two  vnwetyngly
So dronke he was  he nyste what he wroughte
Herodes  who so wel  the stories soughte
    
      
whan he of wyn  was replet at his feste
Right at his owne table  he ȝaf his heste
To slen the Baptist Iohn  ful giltelees
Senek seith a good word  doutelees
he seith  he can no difference fynde
Bitwix a man  that is out of his mynde
And a man  which that is dronkelewe
But that woodnesse  Ifallen in a shrewe
Perseuereth lengere  than doth dronkenesse
O Glotonye  ful of cursednesse
O cause first  of oure confusion
O original  of our dampnacion
Til Crist had bought vs  with his blod ageyn
lo howe deere  shortly for to seyn
Abought was  thilke cursed vilenye
Corrupt was al this world  for glotonye
Adam oure fader  and his wyf also
ffro Paradys  to labour and to woo
Were dryuen  for that vice  it is no drede
ffor whil that Adam fasted  as I rede  
he was in Paradys  and whan that he
Ete of the fruyt  defended  on a tree
Anoon he was out cast  to woo and peyne
O glotonye  on the wel ought vs pleyne
O wiste a man  how many maladies
ffolwen of excesse  and of glotonyes
he wolde ben  the more mesurable
Of his diete  sittyng at his table
Allas the shorte throte  the tendre mouth
Maketh that Est and west  and North and south
In Erthe in Eyr in water  man to swynke
To gete a gloton  deyntee mete and drynke
Of this matere  o Poule  wel kanstow trete
Mete vnto wombe  and wombe eke vnto mete
Shal god destroyen bothe  as Paulus seith
Allas  a foul thyng is it  by my feith
  
To seye this worde  and foulere is the dede
whan man so drynketh  of the white and rede
That of his throte  he maketh his pryuee
Thurgh thilke cursed  superfluitee
The Apostle wepyng  seith ful pitously
There walken manye  of which ȝow told haue I
I seye it now wepyng  with pitous vois
There ben enmys  of Cristes crois
Of which the ende is deth  wombe is here god
O wombe o bely  o stynkyng Cod
ffulfild of donge  and of corrupcioun
At either ende of thee  foule is the soun
how gret labour and cost  is the to fynde
Theise Cookes  how they stampe and streyne and grynde
To tornen substaunce  into Accident
To fulfille  al thy lykerous talent
Out of the harde bones  knokke they
The mary  for they caste nought awey
That may goo thurgh the golet  softe and swote
Of spicerie  of leef of bark and roote
Shal ben his sause  Imaked be delyt
To maken him ȝet  a newere appetit
But certes  he that haunteth  swich delices
Is ded  whil that he lyueth in tho vices
 A lecherous thyng is wyn  and dronkenesse
Is ful of stryuyng  and of wrecchednesse
O dronke man  disfigured is thy face
Sour is thy breth  foul artow to embrace
And thurgh thy dronke nose  semeth the soun  
As though thow seidest ay  Sampson Sampson
And yet god woot  Sampson drank neuere no wyn
Thou fallest  as it were  a stiked swyn
Thy tonge is lost  and al thyn honest cure
ffor dronkenesse  is verray sepulture
Of mannys wyt  and his discrecion
In whom that drynke  hath dominacion
  
he kan no counseil kepe  it is no drede
Now kepe ȝow fro the white  and fro the rede
And namely  fro the white wyn of lepe
That is to selle  in ffysshstrete or in Chepe
This wyne of Spaigne  crepeth subtelly
In othere wynes  growyng faste by
Of which there riseth  swich fumositee
That whan a man  hath dronken draughtes three
And weneth that he be  at hom in Chepe
he is in spaigne  right at the Toun of lepe
Nat at the Rochel  ne at Burdeux Toun
And thanne wol he seye  Sampson Sampson
 But herkneth lordynges  o word I ȝow preye
That alle the souereyne actes  dar I seye
Of victories  in the olde testament
Thurgh verray god  that is omnipotent
were don in abstinence  and in preyere
loketh the Bible  and there ȝe moun it lere
loke Attilla  the grete conquerour
Deyede in his slep  with shame and dishonour
Bledyng ay at his nose  in dronkenesse
A Capitayn shulde lyue  in sobrenesse
And ouer al this  avyseth ȝow right wel
what was comaunded  vnto lamwel
Nat Samuel  but lamwel sey I
Redeth the Bible  and fynde it expresly
Of wyn ȝeuyng  to hem that han Iustise
Na more of this  for it may wel suffise
 And now that I haue spoken  of Glotonye
Now wol I ȝow defenden  hasardrye
hasard  is verray moder of lesynges
And of deceyte  and cursed forswerynges
Blasphemynge of Crist  manslaughtre and wast also
Of catel and of tyme  and forther moo
It is repreue  and contrarie of honour
ffor to ben holde  a comune hasardour
  
And euere the heyer  he is of estat
The more is he holden  desolat  
If that a Prynce  vseth hasardrye
In alle gouernaunce  and policye
he is  as by comune opinion
Iholde the lasse  in reputacion
 Stilbon  that was a wys embassadour
was sent to Corynthe  in ful gret honour
ffro lacedomye  to maken here alliance
And whan he cam  him happed per chaunce
That alle the gretteste  that were of that lond
Pleiyng atte hasard  he hem fond
ffor which  as sone as it myght be
he stal him hom ageyn  to his contre
And seide  there wyl I nat lese my name
Ne wyl nat take on me  so gret defame
Ȝow for to allie  vnto noone hasardoures
Sendeth othere wyse  embassadoures
ffor by my trouthe  me were leuere dye
Than I ȝow shulde  to hasardoures allye
ffor ȝe that ben  so glorious in honours
Shuln nat allye ȝow  with hasardours
As by my wyl  ne as be myn tretee
This wys Philosophre  thus seide he
loke eke  that to the kyng Demetrius
The kyng of Parthe  as the boke seith vs
Sent him a peyre of dys of gold  in skorn
ffor he had vsed hasard  there biforn
ffor which he held his glorie  or his renoun
At no value  or reputacioun
lordes moun fynde  othere manere pleye
honest Inow  to dryue the day aweye
 Now wyl I speke  of othes false and grete
A word or two  as olde bokes trete
Gret sweryng is a thyng  abhomynable
And false sweryng is ȝet  more repreuable
  
The heigh god  forbad sweryng at al
Wytnesse on Mathew  but in special
Of sweryng seith  the holy Ieremye
Thow shalt swere soth thyne othes  and nat lye
And swere in doom  and eke in rightwysnesse
But Idel sweryng  is a cursednesse
Byholde and se  that in the first table
Of heigh goddes hestes  honourable
How that the secund hest of him  is this
Take nat myn name in ydel  or amys
Lo rathere he forbedeth  swich sweryng  
Than homicide  or many a cursed thyng
I seye  that as by ordre  thus it standith
This knowen they  that hise hestes vndirstondith
how that the secunde heest of god  is that
And forthere ouere  I wol the telle al plat
That vengeaunce  shal nat parten  fro his hous
That of hise othes  is to outrageous
By goddes precious herte  and by his nayles
And by the blod of Crist  that is in hayles
Seuene is my chaunce  and thyn synk and treye
By goddes armes  if thow falsely pleye
This dagger shal  thurghout thyn herte goo
This fruyt cometh  of the becched bones two
fforsweryng  Ire  falsnesse  homycyde
Now for the loue of Crist  that for vs dyede
lete ȝoure othes  bothe grete and smale
But Sires  now wol I telle forth my tale
 Theise riotoures thre  of which I telle
longe erst or pryme rong  of any belle
weren set hem in a Tauerne  to drynke
And as they sat  they herde a belle clynke
Byforn a cors  was caried to his graue
That on of hem  gan callen to his knaue
Go bet quod he  and axe redily
what cors is this  that passeth heere forby
  
And loke that thow  reporte his name wel
Sire quod this boy  it nedeth neuere a del
 It was me told  or ȝe come heere  two houres
he was parde  an olde felawe of ȝoures
And sodeynly  he was Islayn tonight
ffordronke as he sat  on his benche vpright
Ther come a pryue thef  men clepen deth
That in this contree  al the peeple sleeth
And with his spere  he smot his herte atwoo
And went his wey  withoute wordes moo
he hath a thousand slayn  this pestilence
And maister or ȝe come  in his presence
Me thynketh that it were  necessarie
ffor to be war  of swich an aduersarie
Beth redy for to mete him  eueremoore
Thus taught me my dame  I sey no more
 By Seynt Marie  seide this Tauernere
The child seith soth  for he hath slayn this ȝere
Hens ouer a myle  withInne a gret vilage  
Bothe man and womman  child  hyne and page
I trowe  his habitacion be there
To ben avysed  gret wysdom it were
Or that he dede a man  a deshonour
Ȝa goddis armes  quod this riotour
Is it swich perile  with him for to mete
I shal him seke  by weye and eke by strete
I make a vow  to goddes digne bones
herkeneth felawes  we thre ben alle oones
lat eche of vs  hold vp his hand to other
And eche of vs  bycome others brother
And we wol slen  this false traytour deth
he shal be slayn  he that so manye sleth
By goddes dignite  or it be nyght
Togyderes han theise thre  here troughthes plight
To lyue and dyen  eche of hem for other
As though he were  his owne Ibore brother
  
And vp they stirte  al dronken in this rage
And forth they gon  towardes that vilage
Of which the Tauernere  had spoke biforn
And many a grisly oth  than han they sworn
And Cristes blissed body  they torent
Deth shal be ded  if that they moun him hent
 whan they han gon  nat fully half a myle
Right as they wolde  han treden ouer a stile
An olde man  and a pore wight  hem mette
This olde man  ful mekely hem grette
And seide thus  now lordes god ȝow se
The proudest  of theise riotours thre
Answerde ageyn  what karle with sory grace
Why artow al forwrapped  saue thy face
Why lyuest thow so longe  in so gret age
This olde man gan loke  in his visage
And seide thus  for I ne can nat fynde
A man  though that I walked into ynde
Neither in Citee  ne in no vilage
That wolde chaunge his ȝouthe  for myn age
And therfore mote I  han myn age stille
As longe tyme  as it is goddes wille
Ne deth allas  ne wol nat han my lyf
Thus walke I  like a restles caytif
And on the ground  which is my modres gate
I knokke with my staf  bothe erly and late
And seye leue moder  lete me In
Lo how I vanysshe  flessh  blood and skyn  
Allas whan shuln myne bones  ben at reste
Moder with ȝow  wolde I chaunge my cheste
That in my chaumbre  longe tyme hath be
Ȝa for an heire clout  to wrappe Inne me
But ȝet to me  she wol nat do that grace
ffor which ful pale  and welked is my face
But sires to ȝow  it is no curteisie
To speken to an olde man  veleynye
  
But he trespace in word  or elles in dede
In holy wryt  ȝe moun ȝour self wel rede
Ageyns an olde man  hoor vpon his hed
Ȝe shulde aryse  wherfore I ȝeue ȝow red
Ne doth vnto an old man  noon harm now
Nomore than that ȝe wolde  a man dide ȝow
In age  if that ȝe so longe abyde
And god be with ȝow  where ȝe go or ryde
I mot go thider  as I haue to goo
Nay olde cherle by god  thow shalt nat so
Seide this other hasardour  anoon
Thow partest nat so lightly  by Seynt Iohn
Thow spake right now  of thilke traytour deth
That in this contre  alle oure frendes sleth
haue heere my trouthe  as thow art his espie
Telle where he is  or thow shalt it abye
By god  and by the holy sacrement
ffor sothly thow art  on of his assent
To slen vs ȝonge folk  thow false thef
Now sires quod he  if that ȝow be so lef
To fynde deth  turne vp  this croked wey
ffor in that Groue  I lefte him be my fey
Vnder a tree  and there he wol abyde
Nat for ȝour bost  he wol him no thyng hyde
Se ȝe that Oke  right there ȝe shuln him fynde
God saue ȝow  that bought ageyn mankynde
And ȝow amende  thus seide this olde man
And euerich of theise riotours  ran
Til he come to that tree  and there fey found
Of floreyns fyn  of gold Ikoyned round
Wel ny an eighte Busshels  as hem thought
No lengere thanne  after deth they sought
But ech of hem  so glad was of the sight
ffor that the floreyns  ben so faire and bright
That doun they sette hem  by this precious horde  
The werste of hem  he spak the first word
  
Bretheren quod he  take kepe what that I seye
My wyt is gret thought  that I bourde and pleye
This tresour hath fortune  vnto vs ȝeuen
In mirthe and Iolifte  oure lif to lyuen
And lightly as it cometh  so wol we spende
Ey goddes precious dignite  who wende
Today  that we shuld han  so fair a grace
But myght this gold  be caried fro this place
hoom to myn hous  or ellis vnto ȝoures
ffor wel ȝe wot  that al this gold is oures
Thanne were we  in heigh felicite
But trewely by day  it may nat be
Men wolde seyn  that we were theues stronge
And for our owen tresour  don vs honge
This tresor  must Ikaried be  by nyghte
As wysly and as sleighly  as it myghte
Wherfore I rede  that kut among vs alle
we drawe  and lat se  where the kut wol falle
And he that hath the kut  with herte blithe
Shal renne to Tovne  and that ful swithe
And brynge vs bred and wyn  ful preuyly
And twoo of vs  shal kepe ful subtily
This tresor wel  and if he wol nat tarie
whan it is nyght  we wol this tresor karie
By oon assent  whereas vs thynketh best
That oon of hem  the kut brought in his fist
And bad hem drawe  and loke where it wold falle
And it fel on the ȝongest  of hem alle
And forth toward the toun  he went anoon
And also sone  as that he was agoon
That oon of hem spak thus  vnto the other
Thow knowest wel  thow art my sworn brother
Thy profyt  wol I telle the anoon
Thou wost wel  that oure felawe is agoon
And heere is gold  and that ful gret plentee
That shal departed ben  among vs three
  
But nathelees  if I can shape it so
That it departed were  among vs two
had I nat doon  a frendes turn to the
That other answered  I not how that may be
he woot that the gold  is with vs tweye
What shuln we doon  what shuln we to him seye  
Shal it be counseil  seide the first shrewe
And I shal telle it  in wordes fewe
What we shuln don  and brynge it wel aboute
I graunte quod that other  oute of doute
That be my trouthe  I wol the nat bewreye
Now quod the first  thow woost wel we ben tweye
And twoo of vs  shuln strengere ben than on
loke whan that he is set  that right anoon
Arise  as though thow woldest  with him pleye
And I shal ryue him  thurgh the sydes tweye
Whil that thow stroglest with him  as in game
And with thy daggere  loke thow do the same
And thanne shal al this gold  departed be
My dere frend  betwix me and the
Than moun we bothe  our lustes al fulfille
And pleye at dys  right at oure owne wille
And thus acorded  ben theise shrewes tweye
To slen the thridde  as ȝe han herd me seye
 This ȝongest  which that went to the toun
fful ofte in herte  he rolleth vp and doun
The beawte of theise ffloreyns  newe and bright
O lord quod he  if so were that I myght
haue al this tresour  to my self allone
There is no man  that lyueth vnder the trone
Of god  that shulde lyue so merye as I
And atte the laste  the fend oure enemy
Putte in his thought  that he shulde poyson beye
with which he myght slen  his felawes tweye
ffor why  the fend fond him  in swich lyuyng
That he had leue  him to sorwe bryng
  
ffor this was outrely  his ful entente
To slen hem bothe  and neuere to repente
 And forth he goth  no lengere wold he tarie
In to the toun  vnto a potecarie
And preyed him  that he him wolde selle
Som poison  that he myght his rattes quelle
And eke there was a polkat  in his hawe
That as he seide  his capouns had Islawe
And fayn he wolde wreke him  if he myght
On vermyn  that destroyed him by nyght
The Potecarie answered  and thow shalt haue
A thyng  that also god my soule saue  
In al this world  there is no creature
That ete or dronke hath  of this confiture
Nat but the mountaunce  of a corn of whete
That he ne shal  his lyf anon forlete
Ȝa sterue he shal  and that in lasse while
Than thow wolt gon a pase  nat but a myle
The poyson is so strong  and violent
This cursed man  hath in his hand Ihent
This poyson in a box  and sithe he ran
Into the nexte strete  vnto a man
And borwed him  large botelles thre
And in the two  hise poyson poured he
The thridde he kept clene  for his drynke
ffor al the nyght  he shop him for to swynke
In cariyng of the gold  out of that place
And whan this Riotour  with sory grace
had filled with wyn  hise grete botelles thre
To hise felawes  ageyn repaireth he
What nedeth it  to sermone of it more
ffor right as they had cast  his deth bifore
Right so they han him slayn  and that anoon
And whan that this was don  thus spak that oon
Now late vs sitte and drynke  and make vs merie
And afterward  we wyln his body berie
  
And with that word  it happed him percaas
To take the botel  there the poyson was
And drank  and ȝaf his felawe drynke also
ffor which anoon  they storuen bothe two
But certes I suppose  that Auycen
wroot neuere in no canon  ne in no fen
Moo wonder signes  of empoysonyng
Than hadde theise wrecches two  or here endyng
Thus ended ben  theise homycydes twoo
And eke the false empoysonere  also
O cursed synne  of alle cursednesse
O traytours homycyde  O wykkednesse
O glotonye  luxurie  and hasardye
Thow blasfemour  of crist  with vilenye
And othes grete  of vsage and of pride
Allas mankynde  how may it betyde
That to thy creature  which that the wroughte
And with his precious hert blod  the boughte
Thow art so fals  and so vnkynde allas  
Now goodemen  god forȝeue ȝow ȝoure trespas
And ware ȝow fro the synne  of Auarice
Myn holy pardon  may ȝow alle waryce
So that ȝe offre nobles  or starlynges

But sires a word  forgat I in my tale

Which were me ȝeuen  by the Popes hond
If any of ȝow  wol of deuocioun

Come forth anoon  and knelith heere adoun
And mekely receyueth  myn pardoun
Or elles takith pardoun  as ȝe wende

So that ȝe offren alwey  newe and newe

It is an honour  to euerych that is heere
That ȝe moun haue  a suffisaunt Pardonere

And thow shalt kisse  the relykes euerychon  
Ȝa for a grote  vnbokle anoon thy purs
Nay nay quod he  thanne haue I Cristes curs

Thow woldest make me kisse  thyne olde breche
And swere it were a Relyke  of a seynt
Though it were with thy foundement  depeynt
But by the Croys  which that Seynt Elyne fonde
I wolde I hadde  thyn coylouns in myn honde
In stede of relikes  or of seyntuarie
lat cut hem of  I wil the helpe hem carie
They shuln be shryued  in an hogges tord
This pardoner answered  nat a word
  
So wroth he was  no word ne wold he seye
Now quod oure hoost  I wol no lengere pleye
With the  ne with noon other angry man
But right anoon  the worthy knyght bygan
Whan that he saw  that al the peeple low
No more of this  for it is right Inow
Sire pardonere be glad  and mery of chere
And ȝe sire hoost  that ben to me so dere
I preye ȝow that ȝe kisse  the Pardonere
And Pardonere I preye the  drawe the nere
And as we diden  lat vs laughe and pleye
Anoon they kisten  and reden forth here weye
AMarchaunt whilom dwelled  at seynt Denys
That riche was  for which men helde him wys
A wyf he hadde  of excellent beaute
And compaignable  and reuelous was she
Which is a thyng  that causeth more dispence
Than worth is  al the chere and reuerence
That men hem doon  at festes and at daunces
Swich salutacions  and countenaunces
Passen  as doth a shadewe  vpon the wal
But woo is him  that paien moot for al
The sely housbond  algate he mot paie
he moot vs clothe  and he moot vs arraie
Al for his owene worshipe  richely
In which array  we dauncen iolily
And if that be nought may  perauenture
Or elles lust nat  swich dispence endure
But thynketh  it is wasted and Ilost
Thanne moot another  paien for oure cost
Or leue vs gold  and that is perilous
This noble Marchaunt  held a worthy hous
ffor which he hadde alday  so gret repair
ffor his largesse  and for his wyf was fair
That wonder is  but herkeneth to my tale
Amonges alle theise gestes  grete and smale
There was a Monk  a fair man and a bold
I trowe a thretty wynter  he was old
That euere in oon  was drawyng to that place
This ȝonge Monk  that was so fair of face
  
Aqueynted was so  with the goode man
Sithe that here first  knewelich  bygan
That in his hous  as familier was he
As it is possible  any frend to be
And for as mechel  as this goode man
And eke this Monk  of which that I bigan
Were bothe two Iborn  in oo village
The Monk him cleymeth  as for cosynage
And he ageyn  he seith nat oones nay
But was as glad therof  as foule of day
ffor to his herte  it was a gret plesaunce
Thus ben they knyt  with eterne alliaunce
And eche of hem  gan other for to assure
Of bretherhede  while that here lif may dure
 ffree was daun Iohn  and namely of dispence
As in that hous  and ful of diligence  
To doon plesaunce  and also gret costage
he nought forgat  to ȝeue the leest page
In al that hous  but after here degree
he ȝaf the lord  and sithen al his meyne
Whan that he coom  som manere honest thyng
ffor which they were as glad  of his comyng
As foule is fayn  whan that the sonne vp risith
No more of this as now  for it suffisith
 But so byfel  this Marchaunt on a day
Shope him  to make redy  his array
Toward the Toun of Brugges  for to fare
To byen there  a porcion of ware
ffor which he hath  to Parys sent anon
A messager  and preyed hath daun Iohn
That he shulde come  to Seynt Denys and pleye
With him and with his wyf  a day or tweye
Er he to Brugges wente  in alle wyse
 This noble monk  of which I ȝow deuyse
hath of his Abbot  as him list  licence
Bycause he was a man  of heigh prudence
  
And eke an officere  out for to ride
To sen here graunges  and here Bernes wyde
And vnto seynt Denys  he cometh anon
who was so welcome  as my lord Daun Iohn
Oure dere Cosyn  ful of curtesie
With him broughte he  a Iubbe of Maluesie
And eke another  ful of fyn vernage
And volatil  as ay was his vsage
And thus  I lete hem  ete and drynke  and pleye
This Marchaunt and this Monk  a day or tweye
 The thridde day  this Marchaunt vp arisith
And on hise nedes  sadly him auysith
And vp into his Countour hous  goth he
To rekene with him self  wel may be
Of thilke ȝer  how that it with him stod
And how that he  dispended had his good
And if that he  encressed were or noon
hise bookes  and hise bagges many oon
he leith biforn him  on his countyngbord
fful riche was his tresor  and his hord
ffor which ful faste  his countour dore he shette
And eke he nolde  that noman shulde him lette
Of hise acountes  for the mene tyme
And thus he sit  til it was passed prime  
Daun Iohn was risen  in the morwe also
And in the Gardyn  walketh to and froo
And hath hise thynges seid  ful curteisly
 This goode wyf cam walkyng  preuyly
Into the Gardyn  there he walketh softe
And him salueth  as she hath don ofte
A maide child  cam in hire compaignye
Which as hire liste  she may gouerne and gye
ffor ȝet vnder the ȝerde  was the mayde
O deere Cosyn myn  daun Iohn she seyde
What eileth ȝow  so rathe for to rise
 Nece quod he  it oughte Inow suffise
  
ffyue houres for to slepe  vpon a nyght
But it were  for an old  appalled wyght
As ben theise wedded men  that lye and dare
As in a fourme  syt a wery hare
wete al forstraught  with houndes grete and smale
But deere nece  why be ȝe so pale
I trowe certes  that oure goode man
hath ȝow laboured  sith the nyght bigan
That ȝow were nede  to resten hastily
And with that word  he low ful merily
And of his owne thought  he wex al reed
 This faire wyf  gan for to shake hire hed
And seide thus  Ȝa god wot al quod she
Nay Cosyn myn  it stant nat so with me
ffor by that god  that ȝaf me soule and lyf
In al the Reame of ffraunce  is there no wyf
That lasse lust hath  to that sory pley
ffor I may synge allas  and weylawey
That I was born  but to no wyght quod she
Dar I nat telle  how that it stant with me
Wherfore I thynke  out of this lond to wende
Or elles  of my self  to make an ende
So ful am I of drede  and eke of care
 This monk bigan  vpon this wyf to stare
And seide allas my Nece  god forbede
That ȝe for any sorwe  or any drede
ffordo ȝoure self  but telle me ȝoure grief
Parauenture  I may in ȝoure myschief
Counseile or helpe  and therfore telleth me
Al ȝoure anoye  for it shal ben secree
ffor on my Portos  I make an oth  
That neuere in my lyf  for lief ne looth
Ne shal I of no counseile  ȝow bewreye
 The same ageyn quod she  to ȝow I seye
By god and by this Portos  I swere
Though men me wolde  al in peces tere
  
Ne shal I neuere  for to gon to helle
Bywreye a word  of thyng that ȝe me telle
Nought for no Cosynage  ne alliaunce
But verrayly for loue  and affiaunce
 Thus ben they sworn  and herevpon they kiste
And eche of hem  told other what hem liste
Cosyn quod she  if that I hadde a space
As I haue noon  and  namely in this place
Thanne wolde I telle  a legende of my lif
What I haue suffred  sithe I was a wyf
with myn housbonde  al be he ȝoure Cosyn
 Nay quod this Monk  by god and Seynt Martyn
he is no more  Cosyn vnto me
Than is this lef  that hangeth on the tre
I clepe him so  by Seynt Denys of ffraunce
To han the more cause  of aqueyntaunce
Of ȝow  which I haue loued specialy
Abouen alle wommen  sikerly
This swere I ȝow  on my professioun
Telleth ȝoure grief  lest that he come adoun
And hasteth ȝow  and goth awey anoon
 My dere loue quod she  o myn Daun Iohn
fful lief were me  this counseil for to hide
But out it mot  I may no lengere abide
Myn husbonde is to me  the werst man
That euere was  sithe that the world bygan
But sithe I am a wif  it syt nat me
To tellen no wyght  of oure pryuyte
Neither abedde  ne in noon other place
God shilde I shulde it telle  for his grace
A wif ne shal nat seyn  of hire housbonde
But al honour  as I can vnderstonde
Saue vnto ȝow  thus meche I tellen shal
As helpe me god  he is nought worth at al
In no degree  the value of a flye
But ȝet me greueth moste  his nygardye
  
And wel ȝe wot  that wommen naturely
Desiren thynges  sexe  as wel as I
They wolden that here  housbondes  shulden be  
hardy and wyse  and riche  and therto free
And buxome vnto his wyf  and fressh abedde
But by that ilke lord  that for vs bledde
ffor his honour  my self for to arraye
A Sonday next  I mot nedes paye
An hundred ffrankes  or elles am I lorn
Ȝet were me leuere  that I were vnborn
Than me were don a sclaundre  or vyleynye
And if myn housbonde eke  myght it espie
I nere but lost  and therfore I ȝow preye
lene me this somme  or elles mot I deye
Daun Iohn I seye  lene me this hondred frankes
Parde  I wyl nought fayle ȝow  my thankes
If that ȝow list  to don that I ȝow preye
ffor at a certeyn day  I wol ȝow paye
And do to ȝow  what plesaunce and seruyse
That I may don  right as ȝow list deuyse
And but I do  god take on me vengeaunce
As foul as euere had  Geneloun of ffraunce
 This gentil Monk  answered in this manere
Now trewely  myn owen lady deere
I haue quod he on ȝow  so gret a routhe
That I ȝow swere  and plight ȝow my trouthe
That whan ȝoure housbonde  is to flaundreȝ fare
I wol delyuere ȝow  out of this care
ffor I wol brynge ȝow  an hondred ffrankes
And with that word  he caught hire by the flankes
And hire embraceth hard  and kist hire oft
Goth now ȝoure wey quod he  al stille and soft
And lat vs dyne  as sone as that ȝe may
ffor by my Chilyndre  it is prime of day
Goth now and beth as trewe  as I shal be
 Now elles god forbede  Sire quod she
  
And forth she goth  as Ioly as a Pie
And bad the Cokes  that they shulde hem hye
So that men myght dyne  and that anoon
vp to hire husbonde  is this wyf Igon
And knokkith at his Countour dore  boldly
Who is there quod he  Petir it am I
Quod she  what sire how longe wol ȝe faste
how longe tyme  wil ȝe rekne and caste
Ȝoure sommes  and ȝoure bokes  and ȝoure thynges
The deuele haue part  on alle swich rekenynges
Ȝe han Inow parde  of goddis sonde
Come doun today  and late ȝoure bagges stonde  
Ne be ȝe nat ashamed  that Daun Iohn
Shal fastynge al this day  elenge goon
What late vs heere a masse  and go we dyne
Wyf quod this man  litel canstow deuyne
The curious besynesse  that we haue
ffor of vs chapmen  also god me saue
And by that lord  that cleped is Seynt Yue
Scarsly amonges twewe  ten shuln thryue
Contynuely lastyng  vnto oure age
We moun wel make chiere  and good visage
And dryue forth the world  as it may be
And kepen oure estat  in pryuetee
Til we be ded  or elles that we pleye
A Pilgrimage  or gon out of the weye
And therfore haue I  gret necessite
vpon this queynt world  to auyse me
ffor euere mot we  stonde in drede
Of hap and fortune  in oure chapmanhede
To fflaundres wol I go  to morwe at day
And come ageyn as sone  as euere I may
ffor which my deere wyf  I the byseke
As be to euery wyght  buxome and meke
And for to kepe oure good  be curious
And honestly gouerne wel  our hous
  
Thow hast Inow  in euery manere wyse
That to a thrifty houshold  may suffise
The lakketh noon array  ne no vitaille
Of siluer in thy purs  shaltow not faille
And with that word  his Countour dore he shette
And doun he goth  no lengere wold he lette
But hastily  a masse  was there seyde
And spedily the tables  were Ileyde
And to the dynere  faste they hem spedde
And richely this monk  the Chapman fedde
 At after dyner  Daun Iohn sobrely
This Chapman toke apart  and preuyly
he seid him thus  Cosyn it stondith so
That wel I se  to Brugges wyl ȝe go
God and seynt Austyn  spede ȝow and gyde
I preye ȝow Cosyn  wysely that ȝe ride
Gouerneth ȝow also  of ȝoure dyete
Atemprely  and namely in this hete
Bytwixt vs two  nedeth no straunge fare  
ffare wel Cosyn  god shilde ȝow from care
And if that any thyng  by day or nyght
If it be in my power  and my myght
That ȝe me wol comaunde  in any wyse
It shal be don  right as ȝe wol deuyse
But oo thyng or that ȝe gon  if it may be
I wolde preye ȝow  for to lene me
An hondred ffrankes  for a weke or tweye
ffor certeyne bestes  that I must beye
To store with a place  that is oures
God helpe me so  I wolde it were ȝoures
I shal nat faile surely  of my day
Nat for a thousand frankes  a myle way
But lat this thyng be secree  I ȝow preye
ffor ȝet to nyght  theise bestes mot I beye
And fare now wel  myn owen Cosyn deere
Graunt mercy of ȝoure cost  and of ȝoure chere
  
 This noble Marchaunt  gentilly anoon
Answered and seide  o Cosyn myn  Daun Iohn
Now sekirly  this is a smal request
My gold is ȝoures  whan that it ȝow lest
And nat oonly my gold  but my chaffare
Take what ȝow lest  god shilde that ȝe spare
But o thyng is this  ȝe knowen it wel Inow
Of chapmen  that here moneye is here plow
We moun creaunce  whil we han a name
But goldlees for to ben  it is no game
Paie it ageyn  whan it lith in ȝoure ese
After my myght  ful fayn wyl I ȝow plese
Theise hondred frankes  he fette forth anoon
And priuely he toke hem  to Daun Iohn
No wight in al this world  wist of this lone
Sauyng this Marchaunt  and Daun Iohn allone
They drynke and speke  and rome awhile and pleye
Til that Daun Iohn  rideth to his Abbeye
 The morwe cam  and forth this Marchaunt rideth
To fflaundres ward  his prentys wel him gydeth
Til he come into Brugges  merily
Now goth this Marchaunt  faste and bisily
Aboute hise nedes  and byeth and creaunceth
he neither pleyeth atte dees  ne daunceth
But as a Marchaunt  shortly for to telle
he ledeth his lyf  and there I lete him dwelle
 The Sonday next the Marchaunt was agon  
To Seynt Denys  Icomen is Daun Iohn
With crovne and berd al fressh  and newe Ishaue
In al the hous  there nas so litel a knaue
Ne no wight elles  that he nas ful fayne
That my lord Daun Iohn  was come agayne
And shortly to the poynt  right for to gon
This faire wyf acorded  with Daun Iohn
That for this hondred frankes he shulde al nyght
haue hire in hise armes  bolt vpright
  
And this acord  performed was in dede
In myrthe al nyght  a besy lif they lede
Til it was day  that Daun Iohn went his way
And bad the meyne  fare wel haue good day
ffor noon of hem  ne no wight in the toun
hath of Daun Iohn  right no suspeccioun
And forth he rideth home  to his Abbeye
Or where him list  no more of him I seye
 This Marchaunt  whan that ended was the feire
To Seynt Denys  he gan for to repeire
And with his wyf  he maketh feste and chere
And telleth hire  that chaffare is so dere
That nedes must he make  a cheuysaunce
ffor he was bounde  in a reconysaunce
To paie twenty thousand sheldes  anoon
ffor which this Marchaunt  is to Parys gon
To borwe of certeyne frendes  that he hadde
A certeyne frankes  and some with him he ladde
And whan that he was come  into the Toun
ffor gret chierte  and gret affeccion
Vnto Daun Iohn  he first goth him to pleye
Nat for to axe  or borwe of him moneye
But for to wyte  and sen of his welfare
And for to tellen him  of his chaffare
As frendes doon  when they ben met Ifere
Daun Iohn him maketh feest  and mery chiere
And he him told ageyn  ful specialy
how he had wel Ibought  and graciously
Thanked by god  al hool his marchandise
Saue that he must  in al manere of wyse
Maken a cheuysaunce  as for his beste
And thanne he shulde  ben in ioye and reste
Daun Iohn answerde  certes I am fayn
That ȝe in hele  ar comen hom ageyn  
And if that I were riche  as haue I blisse
Of twenty thousand sheldes  shuld ȝe nat mysse
  
ffor ȝe so kyndely  this other day
lent me gold  and as I can and may
I thanke ȝow by god  and by Seynt Iame
But nathelees  I toke vnto our dame
Ȝoure wyf at hom  the same gold ageyn
vpon ȝoure benche  she wot it wel certeyn
By certeyne tokenes  that I can ȝow telle
Now by ȝoure leeue  I may no lengere dwelle
Oure Abbot wyl out  of this toun anoon
And in his compaignye  mot I gon
Grete wel oure dame  myn owne nece swete
And fare wel dere Cosyn  til we mete
This Marchaunt  which that was  ful war and wys
Creaunced hath  and paied eke in Parys
To certeyn lumbardes  redy in here hond
The somme of gold  and gat of hem his bond
And home he goth mirie  as a Popingay
ffor wel he knew  he stod in swich array
That nedes must he wynne  in that viage
A thousand frankes  aboue al his costage
his wyf ful redy mette him  atte gate
As she was wont  of olde vsage algate
And al that nyght  in myrthe they ben sette
ffor he was riche  and clerely out of dette
 Whan it was day  this Marchaunt gan embrace
his wyf al newe  and kist hire on hire face
And vp he goth  and maketh it ful tough
Nomore quod she  by god ȝe han Inow
And wantounly ageyn  with him she pleide
Till atte laste  this Marchaunt seide
By god quod he  I am a litel wroth
With ȝow my wyf  although it me be loth
And wot ȝe why  by god as that I gesse
That ȝe han made  a manere straungenesse
Bitwixen me  and my Cosyn  Daun Iohn
Ȝe shulde han warned me  or I had gon
  
That he ȝow hadde  an hondred frankes paid
By redy tokene  and held him euele apaid
ffor that I to him spak  of cheuysaunce
Me semed so  as by his countenaunce
But nathelees  by god oure heuene kyng

I pray the wyf  ne do no more soo 
Tell me allwey  or that I from the go
Yf ony dettour  hath in myn absence
Ypaied the  lest thurgh thy necligence
I myght hym axe  a thyng  that he hath payed
This wyf  was nat  afferd  ne affrayed
But boldely she seid  and that anon  
Marie I defye the fals monk dan Iohn
I kepe nat of his tokenes  neuere a dele
He toke me certein gold  this wote I wele
What euyll thedom  on his monkes snoute
For god it wote  I wend withouten doute
That he had yeve  it me  by cause of you 
To don therewith myn honour  and my prow
For Cosinage  and eke for bele chere
That he hath hade  full of tymes here
But setth I se  I stonde in this disioynt
I woll you answere  shortly to þe poynt
Ye han mo slakker dettours  þan am I
For I woll paye you  wele and redily
From daye to daye  and yf so be I faile
I am your wyf  score it vp on my taill
And I shall paye  as sone  as euere I may
For by my trouth  I haue on myn array
And nat on wast bestowed euery dele
And for I haue bestowed it so wele
For your honour  for goddes sake I sey
As beth nat wroth  but let vs laugh and pley
Ye shull my ioly body  han to wedd
By god I woll nat paye you but abedde
  
Foryeve it me  myn owen spouse dere
Turne hiderward  and maketh better chere
This Merchaunt sawe  ther was no remedye
And for to chide  it were but folye
Seth that the thyng may nat amended be
Now wyf he seid and I foryeve it the
But by thy lyf ne be no more so large
Kepe bet thy gode  this yeve I the in charge
Thus endeth my tale  and god vs send
Taillyng ynough  vnto our lyves end
Wele seid by Corpus Dominus  koth our Hoost  
Now long mot þou saill by the coost
Sire gentill Maister  gentill Marynere
God yeve the Monk  a thousand last quadyere
A ha felawes  beth ware  of soch a iape
The monk put  in the mannes hode an ape
And in his wyfes eke  by seint Austyn
Draweth monkes no more vnto your in
But now passe ouere  and let vs seke about
Who shall now tell first of all this rout
Another tale  and with that worde he seid
As curteisly  as it hade ben a meid
My lady Prioresse  by your leue
So that I wist I shold you nat agreve
I wold deme  that ye tellen shold
A tale next yf so were that ye wold
Now woll ye vouche it saaf my lady dere
Gladly koth she  and seid as ye shull here

 O Lord our lord  thy name  How merveilous
Is in this large world ysprad koth she
For nat onely thy laude  precious
Perfourmed is  by men of dignitee
But by the mouth of children thy bountee
Perfourmed is  for on the brest soukyng
Som tyme  shewen they  thyn herying
 Wherfore in laud  as I best can or may
Of the  and of the white lilly flour
Which that the bare  and is a maide allway
To tell a storie I woll do my labour
Nought that I may encrece hir honour
For she hirself is honour and þe rote
Of bounte next hir son  and soules bote
 O moder maide  o maide moder free
O bussh vnbrent brennyng in Moises sight
That ravysshedest doun  from the deitee  
Thurgh thyn humblesse  the gost þat in the light
Of whos vertue  whan he thy goost light
Conceyued was  the faders sapience
Helpe me to tell it in thy reuerence
Lady thyn bountee  thyn magnificence  
Thy vertu  and thyn gret humylitee
There may no tonge expresse  in no science
ffor som tyme lady  or men preyen to the
Thow gost biforn  of thyn benygnytee
And getest vs the light  of thyn preyere
To gyden vs  vnto thy sone so deere
  
 My konnyng is so weyke  o blisful Quene
ffor to declare  thyn gret worthynesse
That I ne may  the weight nat sustene
But as a child  of twelmoneth old or lasse
That can vnethe  any word expresse
Right so fare I  and therfore I ȝow preye
Gydeth my song  that I shal of ȝow seye
There was in Assye  in a gret Citee
Amonges cristene folk  a Iewerie
Sustened by a lord  of that contree
ffor foul vsure  and lucre of vilenye
Hateful to crist  and to his compaignye
And thurgh this strete  men myght ride or wende
ffor it was free  and open at either ende
 A litel scole  of cristene folk there stode
Doun atte ferthere ende  in which there were
Children an hep  Icomen of cristene blode
That lerned in that scole  ȝer by ȝere
Swich manere doctrine  as men vsed there
This is to seyn  to syngen and to rede
As smale children doon  in here childhede
 Amonges theise children  was a wydewes sone
A litel clergeoun  seuene ȝer of age
That day by day  to scole was his wone
And eke also  where as he sey the ywage
Of cristes moder  had he in vsage
As him was taught  to knele adoun and seye
his Aue marie  as he goth by the weye
  
 Thus hath this wydewe  hire litel sone Itaught
Oure blisseful lady  cristes moder deere
To worshipe ay  and forgat it nought
ffor sely child  wil alwey sone lere
But ay whan I remembre  on this matere
Seynt Nicholas stant euere  in my presence
ffor he so ȝong  to criste dide reuerence  
 This litel child  his litel bok lernynge
As he sat in the scole  at his prymer
he Alma redemptoris  herde synge
As children lerned  here Antiphoner
And as he durste  he drow him ner and ner
And herkened ay the wordes  and the note
Til he the first vers coude  al by rote
 Nat wist he  what this latyn was to seye
ffor he so ȝong  and tendre was of age
But on a day  his felawe gan he preye
To expounden him this song  in his langage
Or telle him why this song  was in vsage
This preyed he him  to construen and declare
fful ofte tyme  vpoon his knees bare
 His felawe  which  that eldere was than he
Answered him thus  this song I haue herd seye
Was maked  of oure blisseful lady free
Hire to salue  and eke hire for to preye
To ben oure help  and socour whan we deye
I can no more expounde  in this matere
I lerne song  I can but smal gramere
 And is this song  maked in reuerence
Of cristes moder  seide this Innocent
Now certes  I wol do my diligence
To conne it al  or cristemasse be went
  
Though that I  for my primer  shal be shent
And shal be betyn  thries in an houre
I wol it conne  oure lady for to honoure
 his felawe taught him homward  pryuely
ffro day to day  til he coude it by rote
And thanne  he song it wel and boldly
ffor word to word  acordyng with the note
Twyes a day  it passed thurgh his throte
To scoleward and homward  whan he wente
On Cristes moder  set was his entente
 As I haue seid  thurghout the Iuerye
This litel child  as he come to and froo
fful myrily wold he synge  and crie
O Alma redemptoris  euere moo
The swetnesse his herte  perced so
Of cristes moder  that to hire to preye
he can nat stynt  of syngynge by the weye
 Oure first foo  the serpent Sathanas
That hath in Iewes herte  his waspes nest
Vp swal and seide  o Hebrayk peeple allas  
Is this to ȝow a thyng  that is honest
That swich a boy  shal walken as him lest
In ȝoure despit  and synge of swich sentence
Which is ageyns  oure lawes reuerence
 ffro thensforth  the Iewes han conspired
This Innocent  out of this world to chace
An homycyde  therto han they hyred
That in an aleye  had a pryue place
And as the child  gan forby for to pace
This cursed Iew  him hente  and helde him fast
And kyt his throte  and in a pyt him cast
  
 I seye that in a wardrope  they him threwe
Where as theise Iewes  purgen here entraille
O cursed folk  of herodes al newe
what may ȝoure euele entent  ȝow availle
Mordre wol out  certeyn it wol nat faille
And namely there  as the honour  of god  shal sprede
The blod out crieth  on ȝoure cursed dede
 O martir souded  to virginite
Now maistow syngen  and folwen euere in oon
The white lamb  celestial quod she
Of which the gret Ewangelist seynt Iohn
In pathmos wrot  which seith  that they that gon
Biforn this lamb  and synge a song al newe
That neuere flesshly wommen they ne knewe
 This pouere wydewe  awaiteth al that nyght
After hire litel child  but he cam nought
ffor which as sone  as it was dayes light
With face pale of drede  and bisy thought
She hath atte scole  and elles where him sought
Til finaly  she gan so fer aspie
That he last seyn was  in the Iuerie
 With modres pitee  in hire brest enclosed
She gooth as she were half  out of hire mynde
To euery place  where she hath supposed
By lyklied  hire litel child to fynde
And euere on cristes moder  meke and kynde
She criede and at the laste thus she wroughte
Amonges the cursed Iewes  she him soughte
 She freyneth and she preyeth  pitously
To euery Iew  that dwelled in thilke place
To telle hire if hire child  went ought forby
They seiden nay  but ihesu of his grace
  
Ȝaf in hire thought  withInne a litel space  
That in that place  after hire sone she criede
Where as he was casten  in a pyt byside
 O grete god  that performest thy laude
By mouth of Innocentes  lo here thy myght
This gemme of chastite  this Emeraude
And eke of Martirdom  the rubie bryght
There he with throte  Ikoruen  lay vpright
he Alma redemptoris  gan to synge
So loude  that al the place  gan to rynge
 The cristene folk  that thurgh the strete wente
In comen  for to wondre vpoon this thyng
And hastifly  they for the Prouost sente
he com anoon  withouten tariyng
And herieth crist  that is of heuene kyng
And eke his moder  honour of mankynde
And after that  the Iewes let be bynde
 This child with pitous lamentacion
vp taken was  syngyng his song alwey
And with the honour  of gret procession
They carien him  vnto the next abbey
his moder swoughnyng  by his bere lay
vnethe myght the peeple  that was there
This newe Rachel  bryngen froo his bere
 With turment  and with shameful deth echon
This Prouest  doth the Iewes for to sterue
That of this morder wist  and that anoon
he nolde no swich cursednesse  obserue
Iuel shal haue  that euel wol deserue
Therfore with wilde hors  he dede hem drawe
And after that  he heng hem by the lawe
  
 Vpon this bere  ay lith this Innocent
Biforn the chef auter  while the masse laste
And after that  the Abbot with his couent
han sped hem  to burien him ful faste
And whan they haly water  on him kaste
Ȝet spak this child  whan spreynt was the hali water
And sang  O Alma redemptoris mater
 This Abbot  which that was  an holy man
As monkes ben  or elles oughten be
This ȝonge child  to coniure he bigan
And seide  o dere child  I halse the
In vertu  of the holy Trynyte

Seth þat thy throte is kut  to my semyng
 My throte is kut  vnto my nek bone
Seid this child and as by weye of kynd
I shold haue died  ye long tyme agone
But Ihesu Crist  as ye in bokes fynd
woll that his glorie last  and be in mynd
And for the worshipe of his moder dere
Yitte may I syng  o Alma loude and clere
 This well of mercy  cristes moder swete
I loued all wey  as after my kunnyng
And whan that I  my lyf shold forlete
To me she cam  and bad me for to syng
This antym verrely in my dying
As ye han herd  and whan þat I hade song
Me thought she leid a greyn  vp on my tong 
 Wherfore I syng and syng I mot certeyn  
In honour  of that blisfull maiden free
Till from my tung  of taken is þe corn
And after that  this seid she to me
  
My litle child now woll I fecche the
Whan that the greyn  is from thy tung ytake
Be nat agast I woll the nat forsake
 This holy monk this Abbot  hym mene I
His tung out caught and toke awey þe greyn
And he yave vp the gost  full softely
And whan this Abbot  hade this wonder seyn
His salt teres trykled doun as reyn
And gruff he fell all plat  vpon þe ground
And still he lay  as he hade leyn ybound
 The Couent eke  lay vpon tha pament
wepyng and herien cristes moder dere
And after that they rise  and forth ben went
And toke awey  this martir  from his bere
And in a toumbe  of marbell stones clere
Enclosen they  this litle body swete
There he is now  god lene vs for to mete
 O yong Hugh of Lyncoln slayn also
with cursed Iewes  as it is notable
ffor it is but a litle while agoo
Pray eke for vs  we synfull folk vnstable
That of his mercy  god so merciable
On vs his grete mercy  multiplie
ffor the reuerence  of his moder marie  Amen 
WHan seid was this myracle  euery man
As sobre was  that wonder was to se
Till that our hoost  Iape to began
And than at erst he loked vpon me 
And seid thus  what man art þou koth he
Thow lokest  as þou woldest fynd an hare
ffor ever vpon the ground I se the stare  
 Approche nere  and loke vp merely
Now ware þou sirs  and let þis man haue place
He in the waste  was shape as wele as I
This were a popet in an arme to enbrace
ffor ony womman small  and feire of face
Hym semeth elvissh  by his countenaunce
ffor vnto no wight  doth he daliaunce
 Sey þou now somwhat sen other folk han seid
Tell vs a tale of merth  and þat anon
Hoste koth he  ne beth nat euyll appayed
ffor other tale certes  kan I none
But of a Ryme  I lerned long agone
Ye  that is gode koth he  now shull we here
Som deyntous thyng me thynketh by his chere
Listeneth lordynges  in gode intent
And I woll tell verament
Of merth and of solace
All of a kyng was  faire and gent
In bataill and in turnement
His name was Sir Thopace
Yborn he was  in fer cuntre
In flaundres all byyond þe se
At Poperyng in the place
His fader was a man full fre
And lord he was  of þat cuntre
As it was goddes grace
Sir Thopas wax  a doughti swayn
white was his face  as payndemayn
His lippes rede as nose
His rode is like  Scarlet in greyn
And I you tell  in gode serteyn
He hade a semely nose
His here his berd was like saffron
That to his girdle raught adoun
His shone of Cordwane
Of brugges were his hosen broun
His robe was of Syklatoun
That cost many a Iane
  
He coude hunt at wild dere
And ride an haukyng by Ryvere
with grey goshauke  on honde
Thereto he was  a grete Archere
Of wrastlyng  was þer noon his pere
There ony Ram shold stonde
ffull many a maide bright in bour  
They mourne  for his paramour
whan hem were bet to slepe
But he was chast and no lechour  
And swete as is the brambel flour
That bereth the red hepe
And so it fel vpon a day
ffor sothe as I ȝow telle may
Sire Thopas wold out ride
he worth vpon his steede gray
And in his hond a launce gay
A long swerd by his side
he pryketh thurgh a fair forest
TherInne is many a wylde best
Ȝa bothe Buk and hare
And as he priketh North and Est
I telle it ȝow him had almest
bitidde a sory kare
There springen erbes grete and smale
The lycoris and the cetewale
And many a clowe gylophre
And Notemuge to putte in ale
Wheither it be moyst or stale
Or for to leyn in coffre
  
The briddes songen it is no nay
The Sparhauk and the Popyngay
That ioye it was to heere
The thrustelcok mad eke hire lay
The wodedowe vpon a spray
she sang ful loude and clere
Sire Thopas fel in loue longyng
Al whan he herd  the thrustel syng
and pryked as he were wood
his fair steede in his prekyng
So swatte  þat men myght him wryng
his sides were al blod
Sire Thopas eke so wery was
ffor prikyng on the softe gras
So fiers was his corage
That doun he leid him in that place
To make his steede som solace
and ȝaf him good forage
O Seynte Mary benedicite
What eyleth this loue at me
To bynde me so sore
Me dremed al this nyght parde
An Elf Quene shal my lemman be
And slepe vnder my gore
An Elf Quene wil I loue Iwys
ffor in this world no womman is
worthy to be my make 
In towne
Alle othere wommen I forsake
And to an Elf Quene I me take
by dale and eke by downe
  
Into his sadel he clom anoon
And priketh ouer stile and ston
An Elf Quene for to espie
Til he so longe hath ryde and gon
That he fond in a pryue won
The contreye of fairie
So wylde
ffor in that contrey was þere noon
That to him durst ride or gon
Neither wyf ne childe
Til that þere com a gret geaunt
his name was sire Olifaunt
a parilous man of dede
he seide child by Termagaunt
But if thow prike out of myn haunt  
Anoon I slee thyn steede 
With Mace
heere is the Quene of fairye
With harpe and pipe and symphonye
Dwellyng in this place
The child seide also mot I the
Tomorwe wol I mete the
Whan I haue myn Armoure
And ȝet I hope par ma fay
That þou shalt with this launce gay
abyen it ful soure
Thy mawe
I shal perce if I may
Or it be fully prime of day
ffor heere thow shalt be slawe
  
Sire Thopas drow abak ful faste
This Geaunt at him stones caste
Out of a fel staf slynge
But faire askapith child Thopas
And al it was thurgh goddes gras
And thurgh his fair berynge
Ȝet listeneth lordes to my tale
Meriere than the Nyghtyngale
I wol ȝow rowne
how sire Thopas with sydes smale
Prykyng ouer hil and dale
Is come ageyn to towne
his merie men comaunded he
To make him bothe game and gle
ffor nedes must he fighte
With a Geaunt with hedes thre
ffor paramour and Iolite
Of on that shon ful brighte
Do come he seide my Mynestrales
And gestoures for to telle tales
Anon in myn armyng
Of romaunces that ben reals
Of Popes and of Cardynales
And eke of loue longyng
They fette him first swete wyn
And Mede eke in a Maselyn
And real spicerie
Of gyngerbred that was ful fyn
And lycoris and eke Comyn
with sugre þat is trie
  
he dede next his white ler
Of cloth of lake fyn and cler
A breche and eke a sherte
And next his shert an Aketon
And ouer that an haberion
ffor percyng of his herte
And ouer that a fyn hauberk
Was al Iwrought of Iewes werk
fful strong it was of plate
And ouer that his cote armour
As white as is a lilie flour
In which he wol debate
his sheld was al of gold so red
And þere Inne was a Bores hed
A charbocle be his syde
And þere he swor on ale and bred
how that the Geaunt shal be ded
bityde what bytyde
hise Iambeus were of quyrbuly
his swerd shede of yuory
helme of laton bright
His sadel was of rewel bon  
his brydel as the sonne shon
Or as the Mone light
his spere was of fyn Cypres
That bodeth werre and no thyng pes
the hed ful sharp Igrounde
his steede was al appel gray
It goth an aumble in the wey
fful softly and rounde
  
In londe
loo lordes myn heere is a fyt
If ȝe wyln any more of it
To telle it I wol fonde
 Now holde ȝoure mouth par charite
Bothe knyght and lady free
and herkeneth to my spelle
Of bataille and of cheualry
And of ladies loue drury
Anoon I wol ȝow telle
Men speken of romaunces of pris
Of horn Child and of ypotis
Of Beus and Sire Guy
Of sire libeus and pleyndamour
But sire Thopas he bereth the flour
Of real Chyualrie
his good steede al he bystrod
And forth vpon his weye he wold
As sparcle out of the brond
Vpon his creste he bar a Tour
And þereInne stiked a lilye flour
god shilde his cors fro shonde
And forth he was knyght Auntrous
he nolde slepen in noon hous
But lyggen in his hode
his bright helm was his wonger
And by him baiteth his destrer
Of Erbes fyve and goode
  
him self drank water of the welle
As dede the knyght sire Parcyuelle
so worthy vnder wede
Til on a day
  
 No more of this  for goddes dignytee
Quod oure hoost  for thow makest me
So wery  of thyn verray lewednesse
That also wysly  god my soule blisse
Myne Eres aken  of thy drasty speche
Now swich a ryme  the deuele I beteche
This may wel be ryme dogerell  quod he
 Why so quod I  why woltow lette me
More of my tale  than another man
Syn that it is  the best ryme I can
 By god quod he  for pleynly at a word
Thy drasty rymyng  is nat worth a tord
Thow doost nat elles  but despendest tyme
Sire at o word  thow shalt no lengere ryme
lat se  wher thow kanst tellen ought in geste
Or tellen in prose  somwhat atte leste
In which there be som myrthe  or som doctrine
 Gladly quod I  by goddes swete pyne  
I wol ȝow telle  a litil thyng in prose
That oughte like ȝow  as I suppose
Or elles certes  ȝe be to daungerous
It is a moral tale  vertuous
Al be it told  somtyme  in sondry wyse
Of sondry folk  as I shal ȝow deuyse
As thus  ȝe wot that euery Euaungelist
That telleth vs  the peyne of Ihesu crist
Ne seith nat alle thyng  as his felawe doth
But nathelees  his sentence is al soth
And alle accorden  as in here sentence
Al be there  in here tellyng difference
  
ffor somme of hem seyn more  and some sey lasse
Whan they  his pitous passion expresse
I mene of Mark  Mathew  luke and Iohn
But doutelees  here sentence is al oon
Therfore lordyngges alle  I ȝow byseche
If ȝow thynke I varie  as in my speche
As thus  though that I telle  somwhat more
Of prouerbes  than ȝe han herd bifore
Comprehended  in this litel tretys heere
To enforce with  the effect of my matere
And though I nat  the same wordes seye
As ȝe han herd  ȝet to ȝow alle I preye
Blameth me nought  for as in my sentence
Shuln ȝe no wher  fynden  difference
ffro the sentence  of this tretys lite
After the which  this mery tale I wryte
And þerfore herkeneth  what that I shal seye
And lat me tellen al my tale  I preye
WHan ended was my tale  of Melibe
And of Prudence  and hire benygnetee
Oure Host seide  as I am a feithful man
And by þat precious corpus  Madrian
I had leuere  than a barel ale
That goodleef my wyf  had herd this tale
She nys nothyng  of swich pacience  
As was this Melibeus wyf  Prudence
By goddes bones  whan I bete myne knaues
She bryngeth me  the grete clobbed staues
And cryeth  slee the dogges euerychon
And breke hem bothe bak  and euery bon
And if þat any neyghebore of myne
Wol nat in chirche  to my wyf enclyne
Or be so hardy  to hire to trespace
whan she cometh hom  she raumpeth in my face
And crieth fals coward  wreke thy wyf
By corpus bones  I wyl haue thy knyf
And þou shalt haue my distaf  and go spynne
ffro day to nyght  right thus she wol bigynne
Allas she seith  þat euere that I was shape
To wedde a mylksoppe  or a coward ape
That wol ben ouerladde  with euery wyght
Thow darst nat stonde  by thy wyues right
This is my lif  but if that I wol fight
And out atte dore anoon  I mot me dight
Or elles I am but lost  but if that I
Be like a wylde lyon  fool hardy
I wot wel  she wol do me slee  some day
Some neighebore  and thanne go my way
ffor I am perilous  with knyf in honde
Al be it  that I dar nat  hire withstonde
  
ffor she is bygge in armes  be my feith
That shal he fynde  þat hire mysdooth or seith
But late vs passe awey  fro this matere
My lord the Monk  quod he  be mery of chere
ffor ȝe shuln telle a tale  trewely
loo Rouchestre stant heere  fast by
Ride forth myn owne lord  breke nat our game
But by my trouthe  I knowe nat ȝoure name
wheiþer shal I calle ȝow  my lord Daun Iohn
Or Daun Thomas  or elles daun Albon
Of what hous be ȝe  by ȝoure fader kyn
I vow to god  þou hast a ful fair skyn
It is a gentil pasture  there þou goost
Thow art nat like a penaunt  or a goost
Vpon my feith  þou art som officer
Som worthy Sexteyn  or som Celerer
ffor by my fadres soule  as to my dome
þou art a maister  whan þou art at home
No poore Cloistrer  ne no nowys  
But a gouernour  wyly and wys
And there with al  of braunes and of bones
A wel faryng persone  for the nones
I preye to god  ȝeue him confusion
That first the brought  vnto Religion
Thow woldest han ben  a tredfoul aright
hadestow as gret a leue  as þou hast myght
To perfourme thy lust  in engendrure
Thow haddest bygeten  ful many a creature
Allas  why werest þou  so wyde a cope
God ȝeue me sorwe  but and I were Pope
Nat oonly þou  but euery myghty man
Though he were shore ful heye  vpoon his pan
Shulde haue a wyf  for al the world is lorn
Religion hath take vp  al the corn
Of tredynge  and we borel men ben shrympes
Of feble trees  there come wrecched ympes
  
This maketh þat oure Eyres  ben so sklendre
And fieble  þat they moun nat wel engendre
This maketh þat oure wyues  woln assaie
Religious folk  for they moun bettre paie
Of Venus paiementȝ  than moun we
God wot  no lusshburgh  payen ȝe
But be nat wroth my lord  though þat I pleye
fful ofte in game  a sooth I haue herd seye
 This worthy Monke  toke al in pacience
And seide  I wol doon al my diligence
As fer as sovneth  into honestee
To telle ȝow a tale  or two or three
And if ȝow list  to herken hiderward
I wyl ȝow seyn  the lif of Seynt Edward
Or elles first  tragedies wel I telle
Of which I haue an C in my celle
Tragedy is to seyn  a certeyn storie
As olde bookes maken  memorie
Of him þat stood  in gret prosperitee
And is Ifallen  out of heigh degree
Into Miserie  and endeth wrecchedly
And they ben versified  comunly
Of sexe feet  which men clepen exametron
In prose eke  ben endited many oon
And eke in metre  in many a sondry wyse
loo this declaryng  ought Inow suffise
Now herkeneth  if ȝow liketh for to heere  
But first I ȝow byseke  in this matere
Though I be ordre  telle nat theise thynges
Be it of Popes Emperours or kynges
After here ages  as men writen fynde
But telle hem some bifore  and some bihynde
As it now cometh  vnto my remembraunce
haue me excused  of myn ignoraunce
Iwol bewayle  in manere of tragedie
The harm of hem  þat stoden in hey degree
And fellen so  þat þere was no remedie
To brynge hem out  of here aduersitee
ffor certeyn  whan þat fortune list to flee
There may no man  the cours of hire withholde
lat no man truste  on blynd prosperitee
Be war  by theise ensamples  trewe and olde
 At lucifer  though he an Aungel were
And nat a man  at him I wol bygynne
ffor though fortune may  non Aungel dere
ffrom heigh degree  ȝet fel he for his synne
Doun into helle  where as he ȝet is Inne
O lucifer brightest  of Aungelis alle
Now artow Sathanas  þat maist nat twynne
Out of miserie  in which þat þou art falle
 Loo Adam  in the feld of Damyssene
with goddes owne fynger  wrought was he
And nat bigeten  of mannes sperme vnclene
And welte al Paradys  sauynge o tree
hadde neuere worldly man  so heigh degree
As Adam  til he for mysgouernaunce
was dryuen out  of his heye prosperitee
To laboure and to helle  and to meschaunce

 Loo Sampson  which þat was  Anunciat
By the Aungel  longe  or his natyuyte
And was to god almyghty  consecrat
And stod in noblesse  whil he myght se
was neuere such another  as was he
To speke of strengthe  and therwith hardynesse
But to hise wyues  told he his secree
Thurgh which he slow himself  for wrecchednesse  
 Sampson  this noble  almyghty champion
withouten wepene  saue hise handes tweye
he slow  and al torent the leon
Toward his weddyng  walkyng by the weye
his fals wyf  coude him so plese and preye
Til she his counseille knew  and she vntrewe
vnto hise foos  his counseille gan bywreye
And him forsoke  and toke another newe
 Thre hondred foxes  toke Sampson for Ire
And alle here tayles  he togidre bond
And sette the foxes tailles  alle on fire
ffor he on euery taille  had knyt a brond
And they brente alle the cornes  in þat lond
And alle here Olyuerys  and vynes eke
A thousand men  he slow eke with his hond
And had no wepene  but an asses cheke
 Whan they were slayn  so thursted him  þat he
was wel ney lorn  for which he gan to preye
That god wolde on his peyne  han som pitee
And sende him drynk  or elles most he deye
And of this Asses cheke  that was dreye
Out of a wang toth  sprang anoon a welle
Of which he drank Inow  shortly to seye
Thus halp him god  as Iudicum can telle
  
 By verrey force  at Gaȝan on a nyght
Maugree the Philistiens  of that Citee
The gates of the Toun  he hath vp plight
And oon his back  Icaried hem hath he
heigh on an hil  where as men myght hem se
O noble almyghty  Sampson lief and dere
had þou nat tolde  to wommen thy secree
In al this world  ne hadde ben thy pere
 This Sampson  neuere  sither drank ne wyn
Ne on his hed cam rasour noon  ne shere
By precept  of the Messager  dyuyn
ffor alle hise strengthes  in hise heres were
And fully twenty wynter  ȝere by ȝere
he hadde of Israel  the gouernaunce
But sone shal he wepe  many a tere
ffor wommen shuln him brynge  to myschaunce
 vnto his lemman Dalida  he tolde
That in hise heeris  al his strengthe lay
And falsly vnto his foomen  she him solde  
And slepynge in hire barm  vpoon a day
She made to clippe or shere  his heere away
And made hise foomen  al this craft espien
And whan þat they him fond  in this array
They bounde him fast  and putten out hise eyen
 But or his her was clipped  or Ishaue
There was no bond  with which men myght him bynde
But now is he in prison  in a caue
Where as they made him  atte querne grynde
O noble Sampson  strengest of mankynde
O whilom Iuge in glorie  and in richesse
Now maistow wepen  with thyne eyen blynde
Sithe þou fro wele  art falle in wrecchednesse
  
 The ende of this caityf  was as I shal seye
his foomen maden a feste  vpon a day
And maden him as here fool  bifore hem pleye
And this was in a temple  of gret array
But atte laste  he mad a foul affray
ffor he two pilers shoke  and made hem falle
And doun fel temple and al  and there it lay
And slow himself  and eke his foomen alle
 This is to seyn  the Princes euerychon
And eke thre thousand bodies  were there slayn
with fallyng of the gret temple  of ston
Of Sampson  now wol I no more sayn
Beth war by this ensample  old and playn
That no men telle here counseil  to here wyues
Of swich thyng  as they wolde han secree fayn
If þat it touche  here lymes  or here lyues
 Of hercules  the Souereigne conquerour
Syngyn hise werkes laude  and heigh renoun
ffor in his tyme  of strengthe he was the flour
he slow and raft the skyn  fro the leoun
he of Centaures  leide the boost adoun
he Arpies slow  the cruel briddes felle
he goldene Apples reft  of the dragoun
he drow out Cerberus the hound  of helle
 he slow the cruel tyraunt  Busirus
And mad his hors  to frete him flessh and bon
he slow the firy serpent  venimus
Of Achilois hornes two  he brak oon
And he slow Cakus  in a kaue of ston
he slow the Geaunt  Anthous the stronge
he slow the grisly Boor  and that anoon
And bar the heuene  on his nekke long    
 was neuere wight  sithe þat the world bigan
That slow so manye monstres  as dide he
Thurghout this wyde world  his name ran
what for his strengthe  and for his heigh bounte
And euery rewme  went he for to se
he was so stronge  þat no man myght him lette
At bothe the worldles endes  seith Trophee
In stide of boundes  he a piler sette
 A lemman hadde  this noble champion
That hight Dyanira  as fressh as May
And as theise Clerkes  maken mencion
She hath him sent a shert  fressh and gay
Allas this sherte  allas and weyleway
Envenymed was  so sotilly withalle
That or þat he had wered it  half a day
It made his flessh  al from his bones falle
 But nathelees  some clerkes hire excusen
By oon þat hight nessus  that it maked
Be as be may  I wol hire nought accusen
But oon his bak  the shert he wered al naked
Til þat his flessh  was for the venym blaked
And whan he sey  noon other remedye
In hote coles  he hath him seluen raked
ffor with no venym  deigned him to dye
 Thus starf  this worthy myghty Hercules
loo  who may troste  on fortune any throwe
ffor him þat folweth  al this world of prees
Or he be war  is oft Ileid ful lowe
fful wys is he  that can him seluen knowe
Beth war  for whan þat fortune list to glose
Thanne wayteth she  hire man to ouerthrowe
By suche a wey  as he wolde leest suppose

 The myghty trone  the precious tresor
The gloriouse ceptre  and real maiestee
That hadde the kyng  Nabugodonosor
with tonge vnethe  may descryued be
he twies wan Ierusalem  the Citee
The vesselles of the temple  he with him ladde
At Babiloyne  was his souereyne see
In which his glorie  and his delit he hadde
 The fairest children  of the blood real
Of Israel  he let do gelde anoon
And maked eche of hem  to ben his thral  
Amonges othere  Danyel was oon
That was the wysest child  of euerychon
ffor he the dremes  of the kyng expouned
where as in Chadeie  clerk ne was þere noon
That wist to what fyn  hise dremes souned
 This proude kyng  let make a statue of gold
Sexti cubites long  and seuene in brede
To which ymage  he bothe ȝong and old
Comaunded to loute  and haue in drede
Or in a furneys  ful of flaumbes rede
he shal be brent  þat wolde nought obeye
But neuere wolde assent  to that dede
Danyel  ne his ȝonge felawes tweye
 This kyng of kynges  proud was and elat
he wende that god  þat sit in mageste
Ne myght him nat byreue  of his estat
But sodeynly  he loost his dignetee
And like a beest  him semed for to be
And ete hey as an oxe  and lay there oute
In reyn with wylde beestes  walked he
Til certeyne tyme  was Icome aboute
  
 And like an Egles fetheres  wex his heres
His nayles lyke  a briddes clawes were
Til god relesed him  a certeyne ȝeres
And ȝaf him wyt  and thanne with many a tere
he thanked god  and euere his lyf in fere
was he  to don amys  or more trespace
And til þat tyme  he leyd was oon his bere
he knew þat god  was ful of myght and grace
 his sone  which þat hight  Balthasar
That helde the regne  after his fadres day
he by his fader  coude nought by war
ffor proud he was of herte  and of array
And eke an ydolastre  was he ay
his heigh estat  assured him in pride
But fortune kest him doun  and þere he lay
And sodeynly his regne  gan dyuyde
 A feste he made  vnto his lordes alle
vppon a tyme  and made hem blithe be
And thanne his officers  gan he calle
Goth bryngeth forth  the vesseles quod he
which þat my fader  in his prosperitee
Out of the temple of Ierusalem  biraft
And to oure heighe goddes  thanke we  
Of honour þat oure eldres  with vs laft
 His wyf  his lordes  and hise concubynes
Ay dronken  while here appetites laste
Out of þeise noble vesseles  sondry wynes
And oon a wal  this kyng his eyen caste
And sey an hand  armlees  þat wroot ful faste

This hand þat Balthasar  so sore agaste

 In al þat lond  Magicien was noon
That coude expoune  what þis lettre mente
But Danyel  expouned it anoon
And seide kyng  god to thy fader sente
Glorie and honour  regne  tresor  Rente
And he was proud  and nothyng god ne dradde
And þerfore  god  gret wreche vpoon him sente
And him bireft  the regne that he hadde
 He was out cast  of mannes compaignye
with Asses  was his habitacion
And ete hey as a beest  in wete and drye
Til þat he knew by grace  and by reson
That god of heuene  hath domynacion
Ouer euery regne  and euery creature
And þanne had god  of him compassion
And him restored his regne  and his figure
 Eke þou þat art his sone  art proud also
And knowest alle þeise thynges  verrely
And art rebel to god  and art his foo
Thow drank eke of hise vessels  boldely
Thy wyfe eke  and þine wenches synfully
Dronke of the same vesselles  sondry wynes
And heriest false goddes  cursedly
Therfore to the  Ishapen  ful gret peyne is
 This hand was sent fro god  þat oon the wal
wroot  Mane thechel phares  truste me
Thy regne is don  þou weyest nought at al
Dyuyded is thy regne  and it shal be
To Medes and Perses  Iȝeuen quod he
And thilke same nyght  this kyng was slawe
And Darius occupieth his degree
Though he þerto had  neiþer right ne lawe
  
 Lordynges ensample  herby moun ȝe take
how þat in lordship  is no sykernesse
ffor whan fortune  wil a man forsake  
She bereth awey his regne  and his richesse
And eke hise frendes  bothe more and lesse
ffor what man þat hath frendes  thurgh fortune
Mishap  wyl mak hem enemys  I gesse
This prouerbe is ful soth  and ful comune
 Cenobia  of Palymerie Quene
As wryten Persiens  in here noblesse
So worthy was in armes  and so kene
That no wight passed hire  in hardynesse
Ne in lynage  ne in other gentillesse
Of kynges blod of Perce  is she descended
I sey nat  þat she had  moost fairestnesse
But of hire shap  she myght nat ben amended
 ffrom hire childhode  I fynde þat she fledde
Office of wommen  and to wode she went
And many a wylde hertes blood  she shedde
With arwes brode  þat she to hem sente
She was so swift  þat she anoon hem hente
And whan þat she was eldre  she wolde kille
Leones  lepardes  and Beres altorente
And in hire armes  welde hem at hire wille
 She durste  wilde Bestes dennes  seke
And rennen in the Mountaignes  al the nyght
And slepe vnder the Bussh  and she coude eke
wrastlen by verrey force  and verry myght
with any ȝonge man  were he neuere so wyght
There myght no thyng  in hire armes stonde
She kept hire maydenhode  from euery wight
To no man deigned hire  for to be bonde
  
 But atte laste  hire frendes han hire maried
To Onedake  a Prince of that contree
Al were it so  þat she hem longe taried
And ȝe shuln vnderstonde  how that he
hadde suche fantasies  as hadde she
But nathelees  whan they were knytte in fere
They lyued in ioye  and in felicitee
ffor ech of hem had other  lief and dere
 Saue oo thyng  þat she wolde neuere assent
By no wey  þat he shulde by hire lye
But oones  for it was hire pleyn entent
To haue a child  the world to multiplie
And also sone  as þat she myght espie
That she was nat with childe  with þat dede
Thanne wold she suffre him  done his fantasie  
Eft sone  and nat but ones  out of drede
 And if she were with childe  at thilke kast
No more shulde he pleyen  thilke game
Til fully fourty dayes  weren past
Thanne wolde she ones suffre him  do the same
Al were this Onedake  wylde or tame
he gat no more of hire  for thus she seide
It was to wyues  leccherie and shame
In other cas  if that men with hem pleide
 Two sons  by this Onedak  had she
The which she kept in vertu  and lettrure
But now  vnto oure tale  turne we
I sey  so worshipful a creature
And wys therwith  and large with mesure
So penyble in the werre  and curteis eke
Ne more labour myght  in werre endure
Was none  though al this world men shulde seke
  
 hire riche aray  ne myght nat be tolde
As wel in vessel  as in hire clothynge
She was al clad  in perry  and in golde
And eke she left nought  for non huntynge
To haue of sondry tonges  ful knowynge
whan þat she leiser hadde  and for to entende
To lerne bookes  was al hire likynge
how she in vertu  myght hire lyf despende
 And shortly  of this storie  for to trete
So doughty was hire housbond  and eke she
That they conquered  many regnes grete
In the orient  with many a fair Citee
Appertenaunt  vnto the Magestee
Of Rome  and with strong hond  held hem ful faste
Ne neuere myght here foomen  don hem flee
Ay  whil that Onedakes dayes  laste
 Here batailles  who so list hem for to rede
Ageyn Sapor the kyng  and othere moo
And how þat al this processe  fel in dede
why she conquered  and what title þerto
And after of hire myschef  and hire woo
How þat she was byseged  and Itake
lat him  vnto my Maister  Petrak go
That wryt Inow  of this  I vndertake
 Whan Onedake was ded  she myghtily  
The Regnes helde  and with hire propre honde
Ageyns hire foos  she faught so cruelly
That there nas kyng  ne Prince  in al þat lond
That he nas glad  if he þat grace fond
That she ne wolde  vpon his land verreye
with hire they made  alliaunce  by bonde
To ben in pees  and lete hire ride and pleye

Ne him biforn  the Romayn Galien

Ne noon Ermyn  ne noon Egipcien
Ne Surrien  ne non Arrabien

leest þat she wolde hem  with hire handes slen
Or with hire meyne  putten hem to flight
 In kynges habite  wente hire sones two
As Eyres  of here fadres Regnes alle
And Heremanno and Thymalao

But ay fortune hath  in hire hony  galle
This myghty Quene  may no while endure
ffortune  out of hire regne  mad hire falle
To wrecchednesse  and to mysauenture
 Aurelian  whan that the gouernance
Of Rome  come into handes tweye
he shope vpon this Quene  to do vengeaunce
And with hise legions  he toke his weye
Toward Cenobie  and shortly for to seye
he mad hire flee  and atte laste hire hente
And fettred hire  and eke hire children tweye
And wan the lond  and home to Rome he wente
 Amonges othere thynges  þat he wan

This gret Romayn  this Aurelian
hath with him ladde  for þat men shulde it se
Biforn his Triumphe  walketh she
with gilt cheynes  on hire nekke hangynge
Corovned was she  as after hire degree
And ful of Perre  charged hire clothynge
  
 Allas fortune  she that whilom was
Dredful to kynges  and to Emperoures
Now gaureth al the peeple  on hire  allas
And she þat helmed was  in stark stoures
And by force  wan Tovnes stronge  and Toures  
Shal on hire hed now  were a vitrymyte
And she þat bar the Ceptre  ful of floures
Shal bere a distaf  hire cost for to quyte
 O noble  o worthy Petre  glorie of spayne
whom fortune helde  so heigh in mageste
wel oughten men  thy pytous deth compleyne
Out of thy lond  thy brother mad the flee
And after at a Sege  by sotiltee
    
where as he  with his owen hand slow the
Succedyng in thy regne  and in thy rente
 The felde of snow  with the Egle of blak þereInne
kaught with the lyme rod  coloured as the glede

The wykked nest  was wirker of this nede
Nought Charles  Olyuer  þat toke ay hede
Of trouthe and honour  but of Armorike

Brought this worthy knyght  in swich a brike
 O worthy Petro  kyng of Cipre also
That Alisaundre wan  by heigh maistrie

Of which thyne owne lieges  hadden envye
And for no thyng  but for thy Chyualrie
They in thy bed  han slayn the by the morwe
Thus kan fortune  hire whel gouerne and gye
And out of ioye  brynge men to sorwe

 Of Melan  gret Barnabo  viscounte
God of delit  and skourge of lumbardie
Why shulde I nought  thyn Infortune Acompte
Sithe in estat  þou clombe were so heighe
Thy brothers sone  þat was thy double allye
ffor he thy nevew was  and sone in lawe
withInne his prison  made the to dye
But why  ne how not I  þat þou were slawe
 Of the Erl Hugelyn  of Piȝe the langour
There may no tonge tellen  for pitee
But litel out of Piȝe  stant a Tour
In which Tour  in prison put was he
And with him ben  hise litel children three
The eldest skarsely  fyue ȝer was of age
Allas fortune  it was gret crueltee
swich Briddes  for to putte  in swich a cage
 Dampned was he  to dye in þat prison
ffor Roger  which þat Busshop was  of Piȝe
had on him mad  a fals suggestion
Thurgh which the peeple  gan vpoon him rise
And putten him to prison  in swich wyse  
As ȝe han herd  and mete and drynk he hadde
So smal  that wel vnethe  it may suffise
And therwithal  it was ful poore and badde
 And oon a day bifel  that in that houre
whan þat his mete  wont was to be brought
The Gayler shette the dores  of the Tour
he herd it wel  but he spak right nought
And in his herte  anoon þere fel a thought
That they for honger  wolde don him dyen
Allas quod he  allas þat I was wrought
Therewith the teres  fellen from hise eyen
  
 his ȝonge sone  þat thre ȝer was of age
vnto him seide  fader  fader  why do ȝe wepe
whan wyl the gailler  bryngen oure potage
Is þere no mussel bred  that ȝe do kepe
I am so hungry  that I may nat slepe
Now wolde god  þat I myght slepen euere
Thanne shulde nought hunger  in my wombe crepe
There is no thyng but bred  þat me were leuere
 Thus day by day  this child bygan to crie
Til in his his fadres barm  adoun it lay
And seide  fare wel fader  I mot dye
And kist his fader  and dyed the same day
And whan the wooful fader  ded it say
ffor woo  hise armes two  he gan to byte
And seide allas fortune  and weylaway
Thy false whel  my woo al may I wyte
 Hise children wend  þat it for hunger was
That he hise armes gnow  and nat for woo
And seiden fader  do nat so allas
But rathere ete the flessh  vpoon vs two
Oure flessh þou ȝaf vs  take oure flessh vs froo
And ete Inow  right thus  þei to him seide
And after þat  withInne a day or two
The leide hem in his lappe adoun  and deide
 himself dispeired eke  for hunger starf
Thus ended is  this myghty Erl of Pise
ffrom heigh estat  fortune away him karf
Of this tragedye  it ought Inow suffise
who so wol heere it  in a lengere wyse
Redeth the grete Poete  of ytaille
That hight Daunt  for he can it al deuyse
ffro poynt to poynt  nat oo word wil he faille
 Although tha Nero  were vicious
As any fend  þat lith ful lowe adoun
Ȝet he  as telleth vs  Swetoneus
This wilde world  had in subieccion
Both Est and West  North and semptrion
Of Rubies saphires  and of Perles white
were alle hise clothes breided  vp and doun
ffor he in gemmes  gretly gan delite
 More delicat  more pompous of array
More proud  was neuere Emperour  than he
That ilke cloth  þat he had wered oo day
After þat tyme  he nolde it neuere see
Nettes of gold thred  had he gret plentee
To fisshe in Tybre  whan him liste pleye
hise lustes were as lawe  in his degree
ffor fortune as his frend  him wolde obeye
 he Rome Brende  for his delicasie
The senatours he slew  vpon a day
To here how þat men  wolde wepe and crye
And slow his brother  and by his suster lay
his Moder mad he  in pitous array
ffor he hire wombe slitte  to beholde
where he conceyued was  so weylaway
That he so litel  of his moder tolde
 No tere  ouȝt of his eyen  for þat sighte
Ne com  but seide  a fair womman was she
Gret wonder is  how þat he coude or myghte
Be domesman  of hire dede beaute
The wyn to bryngen him  comaunded he
And drank anoon  non oþer woo he made
whan myght is ioyned  vnto crueltee
Allas to depe  wol the venym wade
  
 In ȝouthe  a maister  had this Emperour
To teche him lettrure  and curteisie
ffor of moralitee  he was the flour
As in his tyme  but if bookes lye
And whil this maister  had of him maistrie
he maked him so konnynge  and so souple
That longe tyme it was  þat or tyrannye
Or any vice durste  in him vncouple
 This Seneka  of which that I deuyse  
Bycause Nero hadde of him  swich drede
ffor he fro vices  wolde him ay chastise
Discretly as by word  and nat be dede
Sire wolde he seyn  an Emperour mot nede
Be vertuous  and hate tirannye
ffor which  he in a bath  made him to blede
On bothe hise armes  til he muste dye
 This Nero had eke  of a Custemaūnce
In ȝouthe  ageyns his maister  for to ryse
which afterward  him þoughte a gret greuaunce
Therfore he made him dyen  in this wyse
But nathelees  this Seneka  this wyse
Ches in a bathe  to dye in this manere
Rathere than han  another turmentrie
And thus hath Nero  slayn  his maister dere
 Now fel it so  that fortune list no lengere
The heye pride  of Nero to cherice
ffor though þat he was strong  ȝet was she strengere
She thoughte thus  by god I am to nyce
To sette a man  that is fulfilled of vice
In hey degree  and Emperour him calle
By god  out of his Sete  I wol him trice
whan he leest weneth  sonest shal he falle
  
 The peeple roos vpon him  on a nyght
ffor his defaute  and whan he it espied
Out at his doores  anoon he hath him dight
Allone  and there he wende  han ben allied
he knokked faste  and ay the more he cried
The fastere shette they  here doores alle
Tho wiste he wel  he hadde him self mysgyed
And went his wey  no lengere durst he calle
 The peeple criede  and rombled vp and doun
That with hise Eres  herd he how they seide
Where is this fals tyraunt  this Neron
ffor fere almost  out of his wyt he breide
And to hise goddes  pitously he preyde
ffor socour  but it myght nought betide
ffor drede of this  him þought þat he deyde
And ran into a Gardyne  him to hide
 And in this Gardyne  fond he cherles tweye
That setyn by a fir  gret and red
And to theise cherles  he gan to preye
To slen him  and to girden of his hed
That to his body  whan þat he were ded
were no despite Idon  for his deffame  
him self he slow  he coude no bettre red
Of which  fortune lough  and hadde a game
 was neuere capitaigne  vnder a kyng
That Regnes moo  putte in subieccioun
Ne strengere was in feld  of alle thyng
As in his tyme  ne gretter of renoun
Ne more pompous  in heigh presumpcion
Than Olyferne  which fortune ay kiste
So lykerously  and ladde him vp and doun
Til that his hed was of  or that he wiste
  
 Nat oonly þat this world  had him in awe
ffor lesynge of richesse  or libertee
But made euery man  reneye his lawe
Nabugodonosor  was god  seide he
Noon other god  shulde adhoured be
Ageyns this hest  no wyght dar trespace
Saue in Bethulya  a strong Citee
where Eliachym  a Preest was  of þat place
 But take kepe of the deth  of Oliferne
Amydde his oost  he dronke lay a nyght
withInne his tent  large as is a berne
And ȝet for al his pompe  and al his myght
Iudith a womman  as he lay vpright
Slepynge  his hed of smote  and from his tente
fful pryuyly she stal  from euery wyght
And with his hed  vnto hire toun she wente
 what nedeth it  of king Anthiocus
To telle  his heygh  real mageste
his heigh pride  his werkes venimus
ffor swich another was þere noon  as he
Rede which that he was  in Machabe
And rede the proude  that he seide
And why he fel  fro heigh prosperite
And in an hil  how wrecchedly he deyde
 ffortune him hadde  enhaunced so in pride
That verreyly  he wende he myghte atteyne
Vnto the sterres  vpon euery syde
And in balaunce weyghen  ech mounteigne
And alle the floodes  of the see  restreyne
And goddes peeple  had he moost in hate
Hem wolde he sleen  in turment and in peyne
wenyng þat god ne myghte  his pride abate
  
 And for þat Nichanor  and Thimothe
with Iewes were  venquysshed myghtily  
Vnto the Iewes  swich an hate had he
That he bad  Greithe his Char  ful hastily
And swor and seide  ful dispitously
Vnto Ierusalem  he wolde eft sone
To wreke his Ire on hit  ful crewelly
But of his purpos  he was lette ful sone
 God for his manace  him so sore smote
With invisible wounde  ay incurable
That in hise guttes  karf it so and bote
That hise peynes  weren inportable
And certeynly the wrecche  was vnresonnable
ffor many a mannes guttes  did he peyne
But from his purpos cursed  and dampnable
ffor al his smert  he wolde him nat restreyne
 But bad anoon  apparailen his oost
And sodeynly  or he was of it war
God daunted al his pride  and al his boost
ffor he sore fil  out of his Char
That it hise lymes  and his skin totar
So þat he neither  myght go ne ryde
But in a Char  men aboute him bar
Al forbrused  bothe bak and syde
 The wreche of god  him smote so cruelly
That thurgh his body  wykked wormes crepte
And ther with al  he stank so horribly
That noone of alle his meyne  þat him kepte
Wheither so he woke  or elles slepte
Ne myght nought the stynk  of him  endure
In this myschief  he wayled and eke wepte
And knew god  lord  of euery creature
  
 To al his oost  and to him self also
fful wlatsom was the stynk  of his careyne
No man ne myght him bere  to ne froo
And in this stynk  and this orrible peyne
he starf ful wrecchedly  in a Mounteigne
Thus hath this robbour  and this homycide
That many a man  made  to wepe and pleyne
Swich gerdoun  as bilongeth vnto pride
 The storie of Alexandre  is so comune
That euery wyght  þat hath discrecion
hath herd somwhat  or al  of his fortune
This wyde world  as in conclusion
he wan by strengthe  or for his heigh renoun
They were glad  for pees  vnto him sende
The pride of man and beest  he leide adoun  
where so he come  vnto the worldles ende
 Comparison  myght neuere ȝet be maked
Bitwix him  and another Conquerour
ffor al this world  for drede of him hath quaked
he of knyghthode  and of fredome flour
ffortune him maked  the Eyr of hire honour
Saue wyn and wommen  no thyng myght aswage
his heigh entent  in armes and labour
So was he ful  of leonyn corage
 what prys were it to him  though I ȝow tolde
Of Darius  and an hundred thousand moo
Of kynges  Princes  Dukes  Erles bolde
which he conquered  and brought hem into woo
I seye  as fer  as man may ride or go
The world was his  what shulde I more deuyse
ffor though I wryte  or told ȝow euere moo
Of his knyghthode  it might nat suffise
  
 xij ȝer he regned  as seith Machabe
Philippus sone  of Macedoyne he was
That first was kyng  in Grece  the Contre
O worthy gentil Alisandre  allas
That euere shulde fallen  swich a kas
Empoysenned  of thyne owen folk  þou were

And for the  ne wep she neuere  a teere
 who shal me ȝeue teres  to compleyne
The deth of gentillesse  and of fraunchise
That al this world welded  in his demeyne
And ȝet him thoughte  it myghte nat suffise
So ful was his corage  of hey emprise
Allas who shal me helpe  to endyte
ffalse fortune  and poyson to despise
The which two  of al this woo  I wyte
 By wysdom  manhed  and by gret labour
ffram humble bedde  to real magestee
vp ros he  Iulius  the Conquerour
That wan al thoccident  by lond and see
By strengthe of hond  or elles by tretee
And vnto Rome  made hem tributarie
And sithe of Rome  the Emperour was he
Til þat fortune  wex his aduersarie
 O myghty Cesar  that in Thessalie
Ageyns Pompeus  fader thyn in lawe  
That of the Orient  had al the Chyualrie
As fer as þat the day  bigynneth dawe
Thow thurgh thy knyghthode  hast hem take and slawe
Saue fewe folk  that with Pompeus fledde
Thurgh which þou puttest  al thorient in awe
Thanke fortune  that so wel the spedde
  
 But now a litel while  I wyl bywayle
This Pompeus  this noble gouernour
Of Rome  which þat fley at this bataille
I seye  oon of his men  a fals traitour
his hed of smot  to wynnen him fauour
Of Iulius  and him the hed he brought
Allas Pompeie  of thorient Conquerour
That fortune  vnto swich a fyn  the brought
 To Rome ageyn  repaireth Iulius
with his triumphe  lauriat ful heye
But on a tyme  Brutus Cassius
That euere hadde  of his hey estat  envye
fful priuyly  hath made  Conspiracie
Ageyns this Iulius  in sotile wyse
And cast the place  in which he shulde deye
with boydekyns  as I shal ȝow deuyse
 This Iulius  to the capitolie wente
vpon a day  as he was wont to gon
And in the Capitolie  anoon him hente
This false Brutus  and hise othere foon
And stryked him  with Boydekyns  anoon
with many a wounde  and thus they lete him lye
But neuere grunt he  at no stroke  but oon
Or elles at two  but if his storie lye
 So manly was this Iulius  of herte
And so wel loued  estatly honeste
That though hise dedly woundes  so sore smerte
his mantel ouer hise hipes  caste he
ffor no man shulde sen  his pryuete
And as he lay of deyinge  in a traunce
And wist verreily  that ded was he
Of honeste  ȝat had he  remembraunce
  
 Lucan to the  this storie I recomende
And to Sweton  and to valerius also
That of the storie  wryten word and ende
how þat theise grete  Conquerours two

No man ne truste  vpoon hire fauour longe
But haue hire in awayte  for euer mo

 This riche Cresus  whilom kyng of lyde
Of whiche  Cresus Cirus  sore him drawe
Ȝet was he kaught  amyddes al his pride
And to be brent  men to the fyr him ladde
But such a reyn  down fro the walken shadde
That it slow the fyr  and made to him escape
But to be war  no grace ȝet he hadde
Til fortune  on the galwes  made him gape
 Whan he eskaped was  he gan nat stynte
ffor to begynne  a newe werre ageyn
he wende wel  for þat fortune him sente
Swich hap  þat he eskaped thurgh the reyn
That of his foos  he myghte nat be slayn
And eke a sweuene  vpoon a nyght he mette
Of which he was so proud  and eke so fayn
That in vengeaunce  he al his herte sette
 Vpoon a tree he was  as þat him thoughte
where Iupiter him wessh  bothe bak and syde
And Phebus eke  a fair towayl him broughte
To drye him with  and herfor wex his pride
And to his doughter  þat stod him beside
which þat he knew  in hey science habounde

And she his drem  bygan right thus expounde
  
 The tree quod she  the galwes is to mene
And Iuppiter bitokeneth  Snow and reyn
And Phebus  with his towayle so clene
Tho ben the Sonnes stremes  for to seyne
Thow shalt anhanged be  fader certeyne
Reyn shal the wasshe  and sonne shal the drye
Thus warned him ful plat  and ful pleyne

 Anhanged was Cresus  the proude kyng
His real trone  myght him nought availle
Tragedi es  noon other maner thyng
Ne can in syngynge  crie ne bywaille
But for þat fortune  alday wol assaille

HOo quod the knyght  good sire no more of this

That oon ȝoure bridel hange  oon euery syde
By heuene kyng  þat for vs alle dyde
I shulde er this  haue fallen doun for slepe
Although the slough  had neuere ben so depe
Thanne had ȝoure tale  al ben tolde in veyn
ffor certeynly  as þat theise Clerkes seyn
where as a man  may haue noon audience
Nat helpeth it  to tellen his sentence
And wel I woot  the substaunce is in me
If any thyng  shal wel reported be
Sire seye somwhat  of huntyng I ȝow preye
 Nay quod this Monke  I haue no lust to pleye
Now lat another telle  as I haue tolde
Thanne spak oure hoost  with rude speche and bolde
And seide vnto the Nonnes preest  anoon

Tell vs soch thyng as may our hertes glade
Be blythe  þough þou ride  vpon a Iade 
What þough thyn hors  be both foule and lene
Yf he woll serue the rek nat a bene
loke that thyn hert be mery euermoo
Yis sir koth he  yis hoost so mot I goo
But I be mery  Iwis I woll be blamed
And right anoon his tale he hath attamed
And þus he seid  vnto vs euerychone
This swete preest this godely man sir Iohn
Apoure widowe  somdele stope in age 
was whilom dwellyng in a narow cotage
Beside a grove stondyng in a dale
This widow  of which I tell you my tale
Sen thilk day þat she was laft a wyf
In pacience ledde a symple lyf
ffor litle was hir catell and hir rent
By housbondry  of which as god hir sent
She fonde hir self and eke doughtren two
iij large sowes hade she  and no mo 
Thre keen  and eke a Shepe that hight Mall  
ffull soty was hir boure  and eke hir hall
In which she ete  full many a sklendre mele
Of poynaunt sauce  knewe she neuer a dele
No deyntee mossell  passed þurgh hir throte
Hir diette was accordyng  to hir cote
Replexion ne made hir neuer sike
Attempre diet  was all hir phisike
And exersice  and hertly suffisaunce
The goute letted hir nought for to daunce
No wyn drank she  neither white ne rede
Ne apoplexie shent nat hir hede
hir borde was serued most  with white and blak
Mylk  and broun brede  in which she fonde no lak
Seynd Bacon and som tyme an eye or tweye
ffor she was  as it were  a maner deye
A yerd she hade  enclosed all about
with stykkes  and a drie diche without
In which she hade a Cok hight Chauntcleer
In all þat lond of crowyng nas his peer
  
His vois was merier  þan þe mery orgon
On masdaies  þat in chirche goon
wele sikerer was his crowyng in his logge
Than is a clok or ony Abbeyes orlogge
By nature he knewe ecch assencion
Of the equynoxiall  in þat toun
ffor whan degrees xv were assended
Than crue he  þat it myght nat be amended
His combe  was redder  þan þe fyn corall
And bateld  as it were a Castell wall
His bill was blak  and as þe geet it shone
like asure were his legges  and his tone
His nailes whitter þan þe lilly flour
And like the burned gold was his colour
This gentill Cok  hade in his gouernaunce
vij hennes for to do all his plesaunce
which weren his susters  and his paramours
And wonder like to him  as of colours
Of which  þe fairest hewed on hir throte
Was cleped faire damysell Partelote 
He fethered hir  an hundred tyme a day  
And she hym pleseth  all þat euer she may
Curteys she was  discrete and debonair
And compynable  and bare hir self so fair
Sen thilk day  þat she was vij nyght old
That truely she hath  þe hert in hoold
Of Chauntecleer  loken in euery lyth
He loued hir so  þat wele was hym þerewith
Bot soch a Ioye was it  to here hem syng
whan þat þe bright son  gan to spryng
In swete accorde  my lief is fair in lond
ffor thilk tyme  as I have vnderstond
Bestes and birdes  kouden speke and syng
And so byfell  that in a dawenyng
As Chauntcleer  amonges his wyfes all
Sat on his perche  þat was in þe hall
And next hym sate  þis feir partelote
This Chauntcleer gan grone in his throte 
  
As man þat is in dreme  drecched sore
And whan þat Partelote  þus herd hym rore 
She was agaast and seid hert dere
what eyleth ȝow to grone  in this manere  
ȝe ben a verrey slepere  fy for shame
And he answerde  and seide thus  Madame
I preye ȝow  that ȝe take it nat a grief
By god me mette  I was in swich meschief
Right now  þat ȝet myn herte  is sore afright
Now god quod he  my sweuene recche aright
And kepe my body  out of foule prisoun
 Me mette how that I romed  vp and doun
withInne oure ȝerd  where as I saugh a beest
was lyke an Hound  and wolde han mad areest
vpon my body  and an had me deed
his colour was bitwexe  ȝelew and reed
And tipped was his tail  and bothe hise Erys
with blak  vnlike the remenaunt of hise heris
his snoute was smal  with glowyng eyen tweye
Ȝet for his look  for fere almoost I deye
This caused me  my gronyng doutelees
 A voy quod she  fy oon ȝow hertelees
Allas quod she  for by þat god aboue
Now han ȝe loost myn herte  and al my loue
I can nought loue a Coward  by my feith
ffor certes  what so any womman seith
we alle desyren  if it myght be
To han an housbonde  hardy wys and free
And secree  and no nygard  ne no fool
Ne him þat is agast  of euery tool
Ne noon auentour  by þat god aboue
how dursten ȝe for shame  seye to ȝoure loue
That any thyng  myght make ȝow aferd
han ȝe no mannes herte  and han a berd
Allas  and konne ȝe ben agast of sweuenys
No thyng god wot  but vanytee in sweuene is
  
Sweuenes ben engendred  of replexiouns
And ofte of fume  and of complexiouns
Whan humours ben to habundaunt  in a wyght
Certes this drem  which ȝe han met tonyght
Cometh of the gret  superfluytee
Of ȝoure rede Colera  parde
which causeth folk  to dredyn in here dreemes
Of arwes and of fyr  with rede lemes
Of rede beestes  that they wol hem byte
Of contekes and of waspes  grete and lyte  
Right as the humour  of malencolie
Causeth many a man  in sleep to crie
ffor fere of Blake Beres  or Booles blake
Or elles blake deueles  þat wole hem take
Of othere humours  coude I telle also
That werken many a man  is sleep ful woo
But I wol passe  as lightly as I can
lo Caton which  þat was so wys a man
Seide ne nat thus  ne do no fors of dremes
Now sire quod she  whan we flee fro theise bemes
ffor goddes loue  as take som laxatyf
vp peril of my soule  and of my lyf
I counseil ȝow the beste  I wol nat lye
That bothe of colour  and of malencolie
ȝe purge ȝow  and for ȝe shuln nat tarie
Though in this toun  is noon Appotocarie
I shal my self  to herbes techen ȝow
That shal be for ȝoure ese  and for ȝoure prow
And in oure ȝerd  the Erbes shal I fynde
The which han  of here proprete  by kynde
To purgen ȝow bynethe  and eke aboue
Sire forȝete nat this  for goddes loue
ȝe ben ful colerik  of complexioun
war that the sonne  in his assencioun
Ne fynde ȝow nat  replet  of humours hote
And if it do  I dar wel leye a grote
  
That ȝe shuln han  a feuere terciane
Or an agu  which þat may be ȝoure bane
A day or two  ȝe shuln han degestyues
Of wormes  or ȝe take ȝoure laxatyues
Of lauriol  centaure  and fumetere
Or elles of ellebor  that groweth there
Of Catapuce  or of gaitRys beries
Of herbe yue  growyng in oure ȝerd  þere merie is
Pikke hem right as they growe  and ete hem In
Beth merie housbonde  for ȝoure fader kyn
Dredeth no dreem  I can sey ȝow no more
 Madame quod he  graund mercy of ȝoure lore
But nathelees  as touchyng daun Catoun
That hath of wysdom  swich a gret renoun
Though þat he bad  no dremes for to drede
By god men moun  in olde bookes rede
Of many a man  more of auctoritee
Than euere Catoun  was  so moot I the  
That al the reuers seyn  of his sentence
And han wel founden  by experience
That dremes ben  significaciouns
As wel of ioye  as tribulaciouns
That folk enduren  in this lyf present
There nedeth make of this  noon argument
The verray preeue  sheweth it in dede
Oon of the grettest auctour  that men rede
Seith thus  þat whilom tweye felawes wente
On pilgrimage  in a ful good entente
And happed so  þat they cam in a toun
where there was swich  a congregacioun
Of peeple  and eke so streyt  of herbergage
That they ne founde  as moche as a cotage
In which they myght  Ilogged be
wherfore they musten  of necessite
As for þat nyght  departen compaignye
And ech of hem gooth  to his hostelrie
  
And took his loggynge  as it wolde falle
That oon of hem was logged  in a stalle
ffer in a ȝerd  with Oxen of the plow
That oþer man was logged  wel ynow
As was his auenture  or his fortune
That vs gouerneth  as in comune
 And so bifel  þat longe or it was day
This man mette in his bed  þere as he lay
how þat his felawe  gan vpoon him calle
And seide allas  for in an Oxes stalle
This nyght I shal be mordred  þere I lye
Nowe helpe me dere brother  or I dye
In alle haste  come to me he seyde
This man out of his sleep  for fere abreyde
But whan þat he was wakned  of his sleep
he turned him  and took of this no keep
him thought his dreem  nas but a vanytee
Thus twyes in his sleep  dremed he
And at the thridde tyme  ȝet his felawe
Cam as him þought  and seide  I am now slawe
Byholde my bloody woundes  depe and wyde
Arys vp erly  in the morwe tyde
And at the west gate  of the Toun quod he
A carte ful of donge  þere shalt þou se
In which my body is hid  ful preuyly
Do thilke carte aresten  boldly  
My gold caused my mordre  soth to seyn
And told him euery poynt  how he was slayn
with a ful pytous face  pale of hewe
And trosteth wel  this dreem he fond ful trewe
ffor oon the morwe  as sone as it was day
To his felawes In  he took his way
And whan þat he cam  to this Oxes stalle
After his felawe  he bygan to calle
The hostiler answered him  anoon
And seide sire  ȝoure felawe is agon
  
As sone as day  he went out of the Toun
This man gan fallen  in suspeccioun
Remembryng on hise dreemes  þat he mette
And forth he gooth  no lengere wold he lette
vnto the west gate of the toun  and fond
A dong cart  went for to donge lond
That was arrayed  in the same wyse
As ȝe han herd  the dede man deuyse
And with an hardy herte  he gan to crie
vengiaunce and iustice  of this felonye
My felawe murdred is  this same nyght
And in this Carte he lith  gapyng vpright
I crie out on the Ministres  quod he
That shulden kepe and reule  this Citee
Harrow allas  heere lith my felawe slayn
what shulde I more  vnto this tale seyn
The peeple out stirte  and cast the cart to grounde
And in the myddel of the donge  they founde
The dede man  þat murdrid was al newe
 O blisful god  þat art so iust and trewe
loo how þat þou bywreyest  murdre alway
Murdre wol out  that se we day by day
Murdre is so wlatsom  and abhomynable
To god  that it so iust and resonable
That he ne wol nat suffre it  heled be
Though it abyde  a ȝer or two or three
Murdre wol out  this is my conclusioun
And right anoon  Mynistres of the toun
hant hent the Carter  and so sore him pyned
And eke the Hosteler  so sore engyned
That þei beknew  here wykkednesse anoon
And were anhangid  by the nekke boon
Heere moun men se  that dreemes be to drede  
And certes in the same book  I rede
Right in the next chapitre  after this
I gabbe nat  so haue I ioye or blys
  
 Two men  þat wolde han passed ouer the see
ffor certeyn cause  into fer contree
If þat the wynd  ne had be contrarie
That made hem in a Citee  for to tarie
That stood ful merye  vpoon an hauene syde
But on a day  ageyn the Eue tyde
The wynd gan chaunge  and blew right as hem leste
Iolyf and glad  they went vnto here reste
And casten hem ful erly  for to seyle
But to that oo man  fel in gret merveille
 That oon of hem  in slepynge as he lay
him mette a wonder dreem  ageyn the day
him þought a man stood  by his beddes syde
And him comaunded  that he shulde abyde
And seide him thus  if þou tomorwe wende
Thow shalt be dreynt  my tale is at an ende
he wook and told his felawe  what he mette
And preyed him  his viage to lette
As for that day  he preyed him to abyde
his felawe that lay  by his beddes syde
Gan for to laughe  and skorned him ful faste
No dreem quod he  may so myn herte agaste
That I wol lette  for to do myne thynges
I sette nat a strawe  by my dremynges
ffor sweuenes ben but vanitees  and iapes
Men dreme alday  of Oules and of Apes
And eke of many a mase  therwithal
Men dreme of thyng  þat neuere was ne shal
But sithe I se  þat þou wolt heere abide
And thus forsleuthen  wilfully thy tyde
God woot it reweth me  and haue good day
And thus he took his leue  and went his way
But or that he  had half his cours Iseyled
Noot I nat why  ne what meschaunce it eyled
But casuely  the shippes bottum rente
And ship and man  vnder the water wente
  
In sight of othere shippes  it bysyde
That with hem seyled  at the same tyde
And þerfor  faire Partelote so deere
By swiche ensamples olde  maist þou leere  
That noman shulde be  to rechelees
Of dreemes  for I sey the doutelees
That many a dreeme  ful sore is for to drede
 loo in the lyf of seynt Kenhelm  I rede
That was kenulphus sone  the noble kyng
Of Mertenrike  how kenelm mette a thyng
A lite or he was mordred  on the day
his mordre  in his auysion he say
his Norice  him expouned euerydel
his sweuene  and bad him for to kepe him wel
ffro tresoun  but he nas but seuene ȝer old
And þerfore  litel tale hath he told
Of any dreem  so holy was his herte
By god I hadde leuere  than my sherte
That ȝe had red his legende  as haue I
Dame Partelote  I seye ȝow trewely
Macrobeus  that wryt the auysioun
In Affrike  of the worthy Cipioun
Affermeth dreemes  and seith þat they ben
Warnynge of thynges  that men after sen
 And forþermore  I preye ȝow loketh wel
In the olde testament  of Danyel
If he helde dreemes  any vanytee
 Rede eke of Ioseph  and þere shuln ȝe see
where dreemes ben somtyme  I seye nat alle
warnyng of thynges  þat shuln after falle
loke of Egipte  the kyng Daun pharaoo
his Bakere  and his Boteler also
wher they ne felt  noon effecte in Dreemes
who so wol seke actes  of sondry Remes
May rede of Dreemes  many a wondir thyng
lo Cresus  which þat was  of lyde kyng
  
Mette he nat  that he sat vpoon a tree
which signyfied  he shulde anhanged be
 lo heere Andremacha  Ectoris wyf
That day þat Ector  shulde lese his lif
She dreemed  on the same nyght byforn
how þat the lyf of Ector  shulde be lorn
If thilke day he went  into bataille
She warned him  but it myght nat availle
he went for to fight  nathelees
But he was slayn anoon of Achilles
But thilke tale  is al to long to telle
And eke it is ny day  I may nat dwelle  
Shortly I seye  as for conclusion
That I shal han  of this auisioun
Aduersitee  and I seye forthermoore
That I ne telle  of laxatyues no store
ffor they ben venemous  I woot it wel
I hem deffye  I loue hem neuere a del
 Now late vs speke of myrthe  and sthynte al this
Madame Partelote  so haue I blis
Of oo thyng  god hath sent me  large grace
ffor whan I se the beaute  of ȝoure face
Ȝe ben so scarlet reed  aboute ȝoure eyen
It maketh al my drede  for to dyen

Mulier est Hominis confusio
Madame þe sentence of þis latyn is
womman is all my Ioye  and blis
And whan I fele anyght  ȝoure softe syde
Al be it  that I may nat  on ȝow ryde
ffor þat oure perche  is maad so narwe allas
I am so ful of ioye  and of solas
That I deffye  bothe sweuene and dreem
And with that word  he fley doun fro the beem
ffor it was day  and eke his hennes alle
And with a chukke  he gan hem for to calle
  
ffor he had founde a corn  lay in the ȝerd
Real he was  he was no more aferd
he fethered Pertelote  twenty tyme
And tradde hire eke  as oft  er it was prime
he loketh as it were  a grym leoun
And on his toos  he rometh vp and doun
him deyned nat to sette  his foot to grounde
And chukketh  whan he hath  a corn Ifounde
And to him rennen thanne  his wyues alle
Thus real  as a prince is  in his halle
leue I this Chaunteclere  in his pasture
And after wol I telle  his auenture
 Whan þat the monthe  in which the world bygan
That highte Marche  whan god first maked man
was complet  and Ipassed were also
Syn March bygan  thretty dayes and two
Bifel that Chauntecler  in al his pride
his wyues seuene  walking him beside
Caste vp his eyen  to the bright Sonne
That in the signe of Taurus  hadde ronne
Twenty degrees and oon  and somwhat more
he knew by kynde  and by noon oþer loore
That it was prime  and krew with blisful steuene  
The sonne he seide  is clomben vp on heuene
ffourty degrees and oon  and more Iwys
Madame Pertelote  my worldlis blys
herkeneth theise blisful bryddes  how they synge
And se the fresshe floures  how they sprynge
fful is myn herte  of reuel and solas
But sodeynly him fel  a sorweful caas
ffor euere the lattere ende  of ioye  is woo
God woot þat worldly ioye  is sone ago
And if a Rethor  coude faire endite
he in a cronycle saufly  myght it wryte
As for a souereyn  notabilitee
Now euery wys man  lat him herkne me
  
This storie is also trewe  I vndertake
As is the book  of launcelot de lake
That wommen holde  in ful gret reuerence
Now wol I turne ageyn  to my sentence
 A Colfox ful of sly iniquytee
That in the groue had woned  ȝeres three
By hey ymaginacion  forecast
The same nyght  thurghout the hegges brast
Into the ȝerd  there Chaunteclere the faire
was wont  and eke his wyues to repaire
And in a bed of wortes  stille he lay
Til it was passed  vnderne of the day
waytyng his tyme  on Chauntecleer to falle
As gladly doon  theise homycides alle
That in awayt liggen  to murdre men
O false mordrour  liggyng in thy den
O new scaryot  newe Gaenyloir
ffals dissimilour  o greek Synoir
That broughtest Troye  al vttirly to sorwe
O Chaunteclere  accursed be the morwe
That þou into þat ȝerd  flaugh  fro the beemes
Thow were ful wel Iwarned  by thy dreemes
That thilke day  was perilous to thee
But what þat god forwoot  mot nedes bee
After the opynyoun  of certeyn clerkes
wytnesse oon him  þat any parfyt Clerk is
That in Scole  is gret altricacioun
In this matere  and gret disputisioun
And hath ben  of an hundred thousand men
But I ne kan nat  bulte it to the bren  
As can the holy Doctour  Augustyn
Or Boyce  or the Bysshop Bradwardyn
wheither þat goddis worthy  forewetyng
Streyneth me needly  for to doon a thyng
Needly  clepe I  symple necessitee
Or ellis if free chois  be grauntid me
  
To doo þat same thyng  or do it nought
Though god fornwoot it  or þat it was wrought
Or if his wityng  streyneth neuere a del
But by necessite  condicionel
I wole nat han to done  of swich matere
My tale is of the Cok  as ȝe may heere
That took his counseil  of his wyf  with sorwe
To walken in the ȝerd  vpoon þat morwe
That he had mette þat dreem  þat I ȝow tolde
Wommens counseils  ben ful often colde
Wommannes counseil  brought vs first to woo
And made Adam  fro Paradys to goo
There as he was ful merie  and wel at ese
But for I not to whom  it myght displese
If I counseil of wommen  wolde blame
Passe ouer  for I seide it in my game
Rede auctoures  ther they trete of swich matere
And what they seyn of wommen  ȝe moun heere
Theise ben the Cokkes wordes  and nat myne
I kan noon harm  on no womman deuyne
 ffaire in the sond  to bathe myrily
lith Pertelote  and hire sustres by
Ageyne the sonne  and Chauntecler so free
Sang meriere  than the Mermayde in the see
ffor Phisiologus  seith sikirly
how þat they syngen wel  and merily
 And so bifel  as þat he cast his eye
Among the wortes  on a boterflye
he was war of this fox  þat lay ful lowe
No thyng  ne liste him thanne  for to crowe
But cried anoon  Kok  Cok  and vp he stirte
As man þat was affraied  in his herte
ffor naturely  a beest desireth flee
ffrom his contrarie  if þat he may it se
Though he neuere erst  had seen it  with his eye
This Chauntecleer  whan he gan him espye
  
He wolde han fled  but that the fox anoon  
Seide  gentil sire allas  whider wol ȝe goon
Be ȝe affrayed of me  that am ȝoure freend
Now certes  I were worse than a feend
If I to ȝow wolde harm  or vylanye
I nam nat come  ȝoure counseil for to espie
But trewely the cause  of my comyng
was oonly for to herken  how þat ȝe syng
ffor trewely ȝe han  as merie a steuene
As any Aungel hath  þat is in heuene
Therwith ȝe han in Musyke  more felynge
Than had Boice  or any þat can synge
My lord ȝoure fader  god his soule blisse
And eke ȝoure moder  of hire gentillesse
han in myn hous Iben  to my gret ese
And certes sire  ful fayn wolde I ȝow plese
But for men speke of syngynge  I wol seye
So mote I brouke wel  myne eyen tweye
Saue ȝe  I ne herd neuere  man so synge
As dede ȝoure fader  in the morwenynge
Certes it was of herte  al that he song
And for to make his voys  the more strong
he wolde so peyne him  þat with bothe hise eyen
he muste wynke  so loude he wolde cryen
And stonden on his tippton  therwithal
And strecche forth his nekke  long and smal
And eke he was  of swich discrecioun
That þere nas noman  in no regioun
That him in song or wysdam  myghte passe
I haue wel red  in Daun Burnel the Asse
Among his vers  how þat þere was a Cok
That for a Preestes sone  ȝaf him a knok
Vpon his leg  whil he was ȝong and nyce
He made him for to lese  his benefice
But certyn þere is  no comparisoun
Betwix the wysdom  and discrecioun
  
Of ȝoure fader  and of his subtilitee
Now syngeth sire  for seynt Charitee
 lat se  kan ȝe ȝoure fader countrefete
This Chauntecler  his wenges gan to bete
As man þat coude  his treson nat espie
So was he rauysshed  with his flaterie
Allas ȝe lordes  many a fals flaterour
Is in ȝour court  and many a losengeour  
That plesen ȝow wel more  be my feith
Than he that soothfastnesse  vnto ȝow seith
Redeth Ecclesiast  of flaterie
Beth war ȝe lordes  of here trecherie
 This Chauntecler stod hye  vpoon his toos
Strecchynge his nekke  and held hise eyen cloos
And gan to crowe loude  for the nones
And daun Russel the fox  stirt vp at ones
And by the gargat  hente Chauntecler
And on his bak  vnto the wode him beer
ffor ȝet ne was þere no man  þat him sewid
O destynee  þat may nat ben eschewed
Allas that Chauntecler  fley fro the beemes
Allas his wyf  ne roughte nat  of dreemes
And on a friday  fel al this meschaunce
 O venus  þat art goddesse of plesaunce
Syn þat thyn seruaunt  was this Chauntecleer
And in thy seruyce  dyd al his power
More for delyt  than world to multiplie
Why woltow suffre him  on thy day to dye
 O Gaufreed  deere Maister souereyn
That whan thy worthy kyng  Richard was slayn
with shot compleynedest  his deeth so sore
why ne had I now  thy science and thy lore
The friday for to chide  as deden ȝe
ffor on a friday soothly  slayn was he
Than wolde I shewe how  þat I coude pleyne
ffor Chauntecleres drede  and for his peyne
  
Certes swich cry  ne lamentacion
was neuere of ladies mad  whan ylion
was wonne  and Pirrus with his streite swerd
whan he had hente  kyng Priamus by the berd
And slayn him  as seith vs Eneydes
As maden alle the hennes  in the cloos
whan they had seyn  of Chauntecleer the sighte
But souereynly  Dame Pertelote shrighte
fful loudere  than dede  hasdrubales wyf
whan þat hire housbonde  hadde Ilost his lyf
And þat the Romaynes  hadden brent Cartage
She was so ful of turment  and of rage
That wilfully  into the fyr she stirte
And brent hire seluen  with a stedfast herte
 O wooful hennes  right so cryden ȝe  
As whan þat Nero  brente the Citee
Of Rome  criden Senatoures wyues
ffor þat here housbondes  losten alle here lyues
withouten gilt  this Nero hath hem slayn
 Now wol I turne  vnto my tale ageyn
The sely wydewe  and eke hire doughtren two
herden theise hennes crie  and maken woo
And out at the dores  stirten they anoon
And seye the fox  toward the groue goon
And bar vpon his bak  the Cok away
And criden out harrowe  and weylaway
ha ha the fox  and after him they ran
And eke with staues  many another man
Ran Colle oure dogge  and Talbot and gerland
And Malkyn with a distaf  in hire hand
Ran kow and kalf  and eke the verray hogges
So feered for the berkyng  of the dogges
And showtyng of the men  and wommen eke
They ronne so  hem thought here hertes breke
They ȝelleden as fendes  don in helle
The Dokes criden  as men wolde hem quelle
  
The Gees for fere  flowen ouer the trees
Out of the hyue  kom the swarme of bees
So hidous was the noise  A benedicitee
Certes he Iakke straw  and his meyne
Ne maden neuere shoutes  half so shille
whan þat they wolden  any flemmyng kylle
As thilke day was maad  vpon the fox
Of Bras they broughten beemes  and of Box
Of horn  of Boon  in which they blew and pouped
And þerewithal  they shrykeden and they houped
It semed  as that heuene shulde falle
Now goode men I prey ȝow  herkeneth alle
lo how fortune  turneth sodeynly
The hope and pride eke  of hire enemy
This Cok þat lay  vpoon the foxes bak
In al his drede  vnto the fox he spak
And seide sire  if I were as ȝe
Ȝet wolde I seyn  as wys god helpe me
Turneth ageyn  ȝe proude Cherles alle
A verrey pestilence  vpoon ȝow falle
Now I am comen vnto the wodes syde
Maugree ȝoure hed  the Cook shal heere abide
I wol him ete in feith  and that anoon
The fox answered  in feith it shal be doon  
And as he spak þat word  al sodeynly
The Cok brak from his mouth  delyuerly
And hye vpon a tree  he flaw anoon
And whan the fox saw  þat the Cok was gon
Allas quod he  o chaunteclere allas
I haue to ȝow quod he  Idon trespas
In as meche  as I maked ȝow afferd
whan I ȝow hente  and brought into this ȝerd
But sithe I dede it  in no wykke entente
Come doun  and I shal telle ȝow what I mente
I shal sey soth to ȝow  god helpe me so
Nay  thanne quod he  I shrewe vs bothe two
  
And first I shrewe my self  bothe blode and bones
If þou begile me  oftere than ones
Thow shalt no more  thurgh thy flaterie
Do me to synge  and wynke with myn eye
ffor he þat wynketh  whan he shulde see
Al wilfully  god lat him neuere thee
Nay quod the fox  but god ȝeue him meschaunce
That is so vndiscret  of gouernaunce
That iangleth  whan he shulde holde his pees
lo which it is  for to be rechelees
And necligent  and troste on flaterie
But ȝe þat holden this tale  of folie
As of a fox  or of a Cok  or hen
Taketh the moralitee  goode men
ffor seynt Poule seith  þat al þat wryten is
To oure doctrine  it is Iwryte Iwys
Taketh the fruyt  and lat the chaf be stille
Now goode god  if þat it be thy wylle
As seith my lord  so make vs alle goode men
An brynge vs to his blisse  Amen

Sire Nonnes Preest  oure hoost seide anoon

This was a murie tale  of Chauntecleer
But by my trouthe  if þou were seculer
Thow woldest ben a tredfoul  aright

The were nede of hennes  as I wene

So gret a nekke  and swich a large breest

Now sire  faire falle ȝow  for ȝoure tale
And after that  he with ful merie chere

THe ministre  and the Norice vnto vices

That is to seyn  by leueful bysinesse
Wel oughte we  to don al oure entente

 ffor he þat with his thousand cordes  slye
Continuely vs wayteth  to biclappe

Til þat a man be hent  right by the lappe

 And though men dradden  neuere for to dye
Ȝet se men wel  by resōn doutelees

Of which þere neuere cometh  no good ne encrees
And syn that slouthe  hire holdeth in a lees
Oonly for to slepe  and ete and drynke
And to deuouren  al þat othere swynke
  
 And for to putte vs  from swich ydelnesse
That cause is  of so gret confusion

After the legende  in translacion
Right of thy glorious lyf  and passion
Thow with thy gerland  wrought of Rose and lilie

 And for þat feith  is deth  withouten werkes
So for to werkyn  ȝeue me wyt and space

There as withouten ende  is songe Osanne
Thow Cristes moder  doughter deere of Anne
 And of thy light  my soule in prison lighte
That troubled is  by the cogitacion
Of my body  and also by the wighte
Of erthely lust  and fals affeccion
O hauene of refuyt  o sauacion
Of hem  þat ben in sorwe  and in distresse
Now helpe  for to my werke  I wol me dresse
  
 Ȝet preye I ȝow  that reden that I wryte
fforȝeue me  that I do no diligence
This ilke storie  subtilly to endite
ffor bothe haue I  the wordes and sentence
Of him  that at the seyntes reuerence
The storie wrot  and folwen hire legende
And preye ȝow  þat ȝe wole my werk amende
 ffirst wolde I ȝow  the name of Seynt Cecelie
Expoune  as men moun in hire storie se
It is to seyn on englissh  heuenes lilie
ffor pure chastnesse  of virginite
Or for she whitnesse hadde  of honestee
And grene of conscience  and of good fame
The swote sauour  lilie was hire name
 Or Cecile is to sayn  the weye to blynde
ffor she ensaumple was  by good techynge
Or ellis Cecile  as I wretyn fynde
Is ioyned  by a maner  conioynynge
Of heuene and lia  and here in figurynge
The heuene is set  for thought of holynesse
And lia  for hire lastynge bysinesse
 Cecile  may eke be seid  in this manere
wantyng of blyndnesse  for hire grete light
Of sapience  and for hire thewes clere  
Or ellis lo  this maydenes name bright
Of heuene and leos  cometh  for which by right
Men myghte hire wel  the heuene of peeple calle
Ensample of good  and wyse werkes alle
  
 ffor leos peeple  in englissh is to seye
And right as men moun  in the heuene se
The Sonne and Moone  and sterres euery weye
Right so  men goostly  in this mayden free
Seyen of feith  the magnanymytee
And eke the clernesse  hol of sapience
And sondry werkes  brighte of excellence
 And right so  as theise philosophres wryte
That heuene is swift  and round  and eke brennynge
Right so was faire Cecile  the white
fful swift and bysy  euere in good werkynge
And round and hool  in good perseuerynge
And brennyng euere  in Charite ful brighte
Now haue I ȝow declared  what she highte
 This mayden bright  Cecile  as hire lif seith
was come of Romayns  and of noble kynde
And from hire Cradel  vpfostred in the feith
Of Crist  and bar his gospel in hire mynde
She neuer cessed  as I wryten fynde
Of hire preyere  and god to loue and drede
Bysekynge him to kepe  hire maydenhede
 And whan this mayden shulde  vnto a man
Iwedded be  that was ful ȝonge of age
which þat Icleped was  valerian
And day was comen  of hire mariage
She ful deuout and humble  in hire corage
vnder hire robe of gold  þat sat ful faire
had next hire flessh  Iclad hire in an hayre
  
 And whil þat the Orgenes  maden melodye
To god allone  in hire herte thus song she
O lord my soule  and eke my body gye
vnwemmed  lest þat I confounded be
And for his loue  þat deyde vpon the tree
Euery secunde  and thridde day she faste
Ay biddyng  in hire orisouns ful faste
 The nyght cam  and to bedde must she goon
with hire housbonde  as ofte is the manere
And pryuely  to him  she seide anoon
O swete  and wel biloued  spouse deere  
There is a counseil  and ȝe wolde it heere
which þat right fayn  I wolde vnto ȝow seye
So that ȝe swere  ȝe shuln it nat biwreye
 Valerian gan faste  vnto hire swere
That for no caas  ne thyng þat myghte be
He shulde neuere moo  bywreyen hire
And thanne at erst  to him seide she
I haue an Aungel  which þat loueth me
That with gret loue  where so I wake or slepe
Is redy ay  my body for to kepe
 And if that he may felen  out of drede
That ȝe me touche  or loue in vileynye
he right anon  wol sleen ȝow with the dede
And in ȝoure ȝouthe  thus ȝe shulden dye
And if that ȝe  in clene loue me gye
He wol ȝow loue as me  for ȝoure clennesse
And shewe to ȝow his ioye  and his brightnesse
  
 This valerian  corrected as god wolde
Answerde ageyn  if I shal trosten the
lat me that Aungel seen  and him biholde
And if that it  a verray Aungel be
Than wol I doon  as þou hast preyed me
And if þou loue  another man forsothe
Right with this swerd  than wol I slee ȝow bothe
 Cecile answerde anoon  right in this wyse
If that ȝow list  the Aungel shuln ȝe se
So that ȝe trowe on Crist  and ȝow baptiȝe
Goth forth  to via apia  quod she
That fro this toun  ne stant but myles three
And to the pouere folkes  þat there dwellen
Sey hem right  as that I shall ȝow tellen
 Tolle hem that I Cecile  ȝow to hem sent
To shewen ȝow  the goode vrban the olde
ffor secree nedes  and for good entente
And whan þat ȝe  seynt vrban han biholde
Telle him tho wordes  which I to ȝow tolde
And whan that he  hath purged ȝow fro synne
Than shuln ȝe sen þat Aungel  er we twynne
 This valerian  is to the place goon
And right as he was taught  by hys lernynge
he fond this holy vrban  anoon
Among the seyntes buriels  lotynge
And he anoon  withouten tariynge
Dide his message  and whan that he it tolde  
vrban for ioye  his handes gan vp holde
  
 The teeres from his eyen  leet he falle
Almyghty lord  o Ihesu Crist quod he
Sowere of chast counseil  hierde of vs alle
The fruyt of thilke seed  of Chastitee
That þou hast sowe in Cecile  take to the

The seruyth ay  thyn owen thral Cecile
 ffor thilke spouse  that she tok but now
fful lyke a fiers leon  she sendith heere
As meke  as euere was any lamb to ȝow
And with þat word  anoon there gan appere
An olde man  clad in white clothes clere
That hadde a book  with lettre of gold in honde
And gan biforn Valerian  to stonde
 Valerian as ded  fel doun for drede
whan he him say  and he vp hente him tho
And oon his book  right thus he gan to rede
O lord  of o feith  o god  withoute moo
O cristendom  and fader of alle also
Abouen alle  and ouer alle  euery where
Theise wordes  alle with gold  Iwretyn were
 whan this was red  than seide this olde man
leeuest þou this thyng or no  sey ȝa or nay
I leue alle thyng  quod valerian
ffor sother thyng than this  I dar wel say
vnder the heuene  no wyght thynke may
Tho vanysshed this olde man  he nyste where
And Pope vrban  him cristened right there
  
 Valerian goth hoom  and fynt Cicilie
withInne his Chaumbre with an Aungel stond
This Aungel hadde of Roses  and of lilie
Corounes two  the which he bar in honde
And first to Cecile  as I vnderstonde
he ȝaf that oon  and after gan he take
That other  to valerian hire make
 with body clene  and with vnwemmed thought
kepeth ay wel  theise corones quod he
ffro Paradys to ȝow  haue I hem brought
Ne neuere moo  ne shuln they roten be
Ne lese here swote sauour  trusteth me
Ne neuere wyght  shal sen hem with his eye  
But he be chaast  and hate vylenye
 And thow valerian  for thow so sone
Assentedest  to good counseil also
Sey what the list  and þou shalt han thy boone
I haue a brother  quod valerian tho
That in this world  I loue no man so
I preye ȝow  þat my brother may haue grace
To knowe the trouth  as I do in this place
 The Aungel seide  god liketh thy requeste
And bothe with the palme  of martirdoom
Ȝe shuln come  vnto his blisful reste
And with that word  Tiburce his brother coom
And whan that he  the sauour vndernoom
which that the Rooses  and the lilies caste
withInne his herte  he gan to wondre faste
  
 And seide I wondre  this tyme of the ȝere
whennes that swote sauour  cometh so
Of Rose and lilies  that I smelle heere
ffor though I hadde hem  in myn hondes two
The sauour myghte in me  no deppere goo
The swete smel  þat in myn herte I fynde
hath chaunged me  al in another kynde
 Valerian seide  two corounes han we
Snow white  and Rose reed  þat shynen clere
which þat thyne eyen  han no myght to se
And as þou smellest hem  thurgh my preyere
So shaltow sen hem  leue brother deere
If it so be  þou wolt withouten slouthe
Byleeue aright  and knowen verray trouthe
 Tiburce answerde  seist þou this to me
In soothnesse  or in dreem  I herkne this
In dremes quod valerian  haue we be
Vnto this tyme  brother myn Iwys
But now at erst  in trouthe  oure dwellyng is
how wostow this quod Tiburce  in what wyse
Quod valerian  that shal I the deuyse
 The Aungel of god  hath me the trouthe Itaught
which þou shalt seen  if þat þou wolt reneye
The ydoles and be clene  and ellis naught
And of the myracle  of theise corones tweye
Seynt Ambrose  in his preface list to seye
Solempnely  this noble doctour deere
Commendeth it  and seith in this manere    
 The palme of martirdom  for to receyue
Seynt Cecile  fulfild of goddes ȝifte
The world and eke hire chaumbre  gan she weyue
wytnesse Tiburces  and Cecilies shrifte
To which  god of his bountee wolde shifte
Corones two  of floures wel smellynge
And made his Aungel  hem the corones brynge
 The mayde hath brought hem  to blisse aboue
The world hath wist  what it is worth certeyn
Deuocion of Chastitee  to loue
Tho shewed him Cecile  al open and pleyn
That alle ydoles  nys but a thyng in veyn
ffor they ben doumbe  and þerto they ben deeue
And charged him  his ydoles for to leeue
 who so þat troweth nat this  a beest he is
Quod tho Tiburce  if that I shal nat lye
And she gan kisse his breest  that herde this
And was ful glad  he coude trouthe espye
This day  I take the  for myn allye
Seide this blisful  faire mayde deere
And after þat she seide  as ȝe moun heere
 lo  right so  as the loue of Crist  quod she
Made me thy brothers wyf  right in that wyse
Anoon for myn allye  heere take I the
Syn þat þou wolt  thyne ydoles despise
Go with thy brother now  and the baptise
And make the clene  so þat þou nowe byholde
The Aungels face  of which thy brother tolde
  
 Tiburce answerde  and seide Brother deere
ffirst telle me  whider þat I shal  and to what man
To whom quod he  come forth with right good cheere
I wol the lede  vnto the Pope vrban
To vrban  Brother myn valerian
Quod tho Tiburce  woltow me thider lede
Me thynketh  that it were a wonder dede
 Ne menestow nat vrban  quod he thoo
That is so ofte dampned  to be ded
And woneth in halkes  alwey to and froo
And dar nat oones  putte forth his hed
Men shulde him brennen  in a fyr so red
If he were founde  or þat men myght him spie
And we also  to bere him compaignye  
 And whil we sekyn  thilke diuinitee
That is Ihid  in heuene pryuely
Algate Ibrent in this world  shuln we be
To whom Cecile answerde  boldely
Men myghten dredyn wel  and skylfully
Thys lyf to lese  my owne deere brother
If this were lyuyng oonly  and noon other
 But there is better lyf  in other place
That neuere shal be lost  ne drede the nought
which goddes sone  vs tolde  thurgh his grace
That fadres sone  hath alle thynges wrought
And al þat wrought is  with a skilful thought
The goost þat fro the fader  gan procede
hath sowled hem  withouten any drede
  
 By word and by myracle  he goddes sone
Whan he was in this world  declared heere
That þere was other lyf  þere man may wone
To whom answerde Tiburce  o suster deere
Ne seydestow right now  in this manere
There nas but o god  lord in soothfastnesse
And now of three  how maistow bere wytnesse
 That shal I telle quod she  er I go
Right as a man  hath sapiences three
Memorie  engyn  and Intellect also
So in oo beyng  of diuinitee
Thre persones  may there  right wel be
Tho gan she him  ful bisily to preche
Of Cristes sone  and of his peynes teche
 And manye poyntes  of his passion
how goddes sone  in this world was withholde
To doon mankynde  playn remyssion
That was Ibounde  in synne  and cares colde
Al this thyng  she vnto Tiburce tolde
And after this Tiburce in good entente
With valerian  to Pope vrban he wente
 That thanked god  and with glad herte and light
he cristned him  and mad him in that place
Parfyt in his lernynge  goddes knyght
And after this  Tiburce gat swich grace
That euery day  he sey in tyme and space
The Aungel of god  and euery maner boone
That he god axed  it was sped ful soone
  
 It wer ful hard  by ordre for to seyn  
how manye wondres  Ihesus for hem wroughte
But at the laste  to tellen short and pleyn
The sergeaunteȝ of the Toun of Rome  hem soughte
And hem  biforn Almache the prefect  broughte
which hem opposed  and knew al here entente
And to the ymage  of Iubiter  hem sente
 And seide  who so wol nought do sacrifise
Swap of his hed  this is myn sentence heere
Anoon theise martirs  that I ȝow deuyse
Oon Maximus  that was an officere
Of the prefectes  and his cornyculere
hem hente  and whan he forth  the seyntes ladde
him self he wep  for pitee þat he hadde
 Whan Maximus had herd  the seyntes loore
he gat him  of the Turmentours leue
And hadde hem to his hous  withoute more
And with here prechyng  er þat it were eue
They gonnen fro turmentours  to reue
And fro Maxime  and fro his folk echone
The fals feith  to trowe in god allone
 Cecile cam  whan it was woxen nyght
With Preestes  þat hem cristened alle Ifeere
And afterward  whan day was woxen light
Cecile him seide  with a ful stedfast cheere
Now Cristes owne knyghtes  leeue and deere
Cast al awey  the werkes of derknesse
And armeth ȝow in armes of brightnesse
  
 Ȝe han forsothe  Idon a gret bataille
Ȝoure cours is don  ȝoure feith haue ȝe conserued
Goth to the corone of lyf  þat may nat faile
The rightful Iuge  which that ȝe han serued
Shal ȝeue it ȝow  as ȝe han it deserued
And whan this thyng  was seid  as I deuyse
Men ledde hem forth  to don the sacrifise
 But whan they weren  to the place brought
To tellen shortly  the conclusioun
They nolde encence  ne sacrifise right nought
But on here knees  they setten hem adoun
With humble herte  and sad deuocion
And losten bothe here heuedes  in the place
here soules wenten  to the kyng of grace
 This Maximus  that sey this thyng betide  
with pitous teeres  tolde it anoon right
That he here soules saw  to heuene glide
with Aungeles  ful of cleernesse  and of light
And with his word  conuerted many a wyght
ffor which  Almachius  dide him so tobete
with whippe of leed  til he his lyf gan lete
 Cecile him took  and buried him anoon
By Tiburce  and Valerian softly
WithInne hire buriynge place  vnder the stoon
And after this  Almachius hastily
Bad hise Mynystres  fecchen openly
Cecile  so þat she myghte in his presence
Doon sacrifise  and Iubiter encence
  
 But they conuerted  at hire wyse loore
Wepten ful sore  and ȝauen ful credence
vnto hire word  and cryden moore and moore
Crist goddes sone  withouten difference
Is verray god  this is al oure sentence
That hath so good a seruaunt  him to serue
This  with o vois  we trowen  though we sterue
 Almachius  that herde of this doynge
Bad fecchen Cecile  þat he myghte hire se
And alderfurst lo  this was his axynge
What maner womman  artow quod he
I am a gentil womman  born  quod she
I axe the quod he  though it the greeue
Of thy religion  and of thy byleue
 Why thanne bygan  ȝoure question folily
Quod she  þat woldest two answeres conclude
In oo demaunde  ȝe axed lewedly
Almache answerde  vnto þat similitude
Of whennes cometh  thyn answeryng so rude
Of whennes quod she  whan þat she was freyned
Of Conscience  and of good feith vnfeyned
 Almachius seide  ne takestow noon heede
Of my power  and she answerde him this
Ȝoure myght quod she  ful litel is to drede
ffor euery mortal mannes power  nys
But like a bladdre  ful of wynd Iwys
ffor with a nedles poynt  whan it is blowe
May al the boost of it  be leid ful lowe
  
 fful wrongfully  bygonne þou quod he
And ȝet in wrong  is al thy perseueraunce  
Wostow nat how  oure myghty Princes free
Ben thus comaunded  and mad ordinaunce
That euery cristene wyght  shal han penaunce
But if that he  his cristendom withseye
And goon al quyt  if he wol it reneye
 Ȝoure princes erren  as ȝoure nobleye dooth
Quod tho Cecile  and with a wood sentence
Ȝe make vs gilty  and is nat sooth
ffor ȝe þat knowen wel  oure Innocence
ffor as muche  as we doon a reuerence
To crist  and for we bere a cristene name
Ȝe put on vs a cryme  and eke a blame
 But we þat knowen  thilke name so
ffor vertuous  we moun it nought withseye
Almache answerde  chees on of theise twoo
Do sacrifise  or cristendom reneye
That þou mowe now  escapen by that weye
At which  this holy blisful  faire mayde
Gan for to laughe  and to the Iuge she seide
 O Iuge confus  in thy nycetee
Woltow  þat I reneye  Innocence
To maken me  a wykked wight  quod she
lo he dissimuleth here  in audience
He stareth and wodeth  in his aduertence
To whom Almachius seide  vnsely wrecche
Ne wostow nat  how fer my myght may strecche
  
 Han nought oure myghty princes  to me ȝeuen
Ȝa  bothe power  and auctoritee
To maken folk  to dyen or to lyuen
Why spekestow so proudly  thanne to me
I speke nought  but stedfastly quod she
Nat proudly  for I seye as for my syde
We haten dedly  thilke vice of pride
 And if þou drede nought  a soth for to heere
Thanne wol I shewe  al openly by right
That þou hast mad  a ful gret lesyng heere
Thow seist  thyne princes  han the ȝeuen myght
Bothe for to sleen  and for to quyken a wight
Thow þat ne maist  but oonly lyf byreue
Thow hast noon other power  ne no leue
 But þou maist seyn  thyne princes han the maked
Ministre of deth  for if thow speke of moo  
Thow liest  for thy power is ful naked
Do wey thyn boldenesse  seide Almachius tho
And do sacrifise to our goddes  er þou go
I recche nat what wrong  þat thow me profre
ffor I can suffre it  as a Philosophre
 But thilke wronges  may I nat endure
That þou spekest  of oure goddes heere quod he
Cecile answerde  o nyce creature
Thow seidest no word  syn þou spake to me
That I ne knew therewith  thy nycetee
And that þou were  in euery maner wyse
A lewed officere  a veyn Iustise
  
 There lakketh no thyng  to thyne vttere eyen
That þou nart blynd  for þing þat we sen alle
That is a ston  þat men moun wel espien
That ilke a ston  a god þou wolt it calle
I rede the  lat thyn hond  vpon it falle
And taste it wel  and ston þou shalt it fynde
Syn þat þou seest nat  with thyne eyen blynde
 It is a shame  that the peeple shal
So scornen the  and laughe at thyn folie
ffor comunly  men woot it wel ouer al
That myghty god is  in his heuenes hye
And theise ymages  wel þou maist espie
To the  ne to hem self  moun nat profite
ffor in effect  they be nat worth a myte
 Theise and swich othere  seide she
And he wex wroth  and bad men shulde hire lede
hoom til hire hous  and in hire hous quod he
Brenne hire  right in a bathe  with flaumbes rede
And as he bad  right so was done the dede
ffor in a bathe  they gonne hire faste shetten
And nyght and day  gret fyr they vnder betten
 The longe nyght  and eke a day also
ffor al the fyr  and eke the bathes hete
She sat al cold  and feled no woo
It made hire nat  a drope for to swete
But in that bath  hire lif she muste lete
ffor he Almachius  with a ful wykke entente
To slen hire in the bath  his sonde sente
  
 Thre strokes in the nekke  he smot hire tho
The turmentour  but for no maner chaunce  
he myght nat smyte  al hire nekke a two
And for þere was that tyme  an ordinaunce
That no man  shulde do man  swich penaunce
The ferthe strok to smyten  soft or soore
This turmentour  ne durste do no more
 But half ded  with hire nekke Ikoruen there
he lefte hire lye  and on his wey is went
The cristene folk  which þat aboute hire were
with shetes  han the blod ful faire Ihent
Three dayes lyued she  in this turment
And neuere cessed  hem the feith to teche
That she had fostred  hem  she gan to preche
 And hem she ȝaf  hire meebles and hire thyng
And to the Pope vrban  bytok hem tho
And seide  I axed this of heuene kyng
To haue respit  three dayes and no moo
To recomende to ȝow  er that I go
Theise soules lo  and that I myght do werche
heere of myn hous  perpetuelly a chirche
 Seynt vrban  with hise dekenes priuely
The body fette  and buryed it by nyghte
Among hise othere seyntes  honestly
hire hous  the Chirche of seynt Cecile highte
Seynt vrban halwed it  as he wel myghte
In which  into this day  in noble wyse
Men don to Crist  and to his seynt seruyse
WHan that told was  the lyf of seynt Cecile
Er we had riden fully  fyue myle
At Boughton vnder blee  vs gan atake
A man  þat clothed was  in clothes blake
And vndernethe he wered  a surplys
his hakeney  which þat was  al pomely grys
So swat  that it wonder was to se
It semed  as he had pryked  myles three
Aboute the peyntrel  stod the fome ful hye
he was of fome  al flekked as a Pye
The hakeneye eke  þat his ȝeman rod vpoon  
So swatte  that vnethe myght it gon
A male tweyfold  vpon his croper lay
It semed that he caried  litel array
Al light for somer  rod this worthy man
And in myn herte  to wondre I began
What that he was  til that I vnderstode
how þat his cloke  was sowed to his hode
ffor which  whan I had longe avysed me
I demed him som Chanoun  for to be
his hat heng at his bak  doun by a lace
ffor he had riden more  than trot or pace
he had ay  priked  lyke as he were wood
A clote leef he hadde  vnder his hood
ffor swete  and for to kepe  his hed from hete
But it was ioye  for to sen him swete
his forhe dropped  as a stillatorie
were ful of plaunteyn  and of peritorie
  
And whan þat he was come  he gan to crie
God saue quod he  this ioly compaignye
ffast haue I pryked quod he  for ȝoure sake
By cause  that I wolde  ȝow atake
To ryden in the same  myrie compaignye
his ȝeman was eke  ful of curteisie
And seide sir  now in the morwe tyde
Out of ȝoure hostelrie  I saw ȝow ride
And warned heere my lord  and my souerayn
which that to riden with ȝow  is ful fayn
ffor his disport  he loueth daliaunce
 ffrend for thy warnynge  god ȝeue the good chaunce
Thanne seide oure hoost  for certeyn it wolde seme
Thy lord were wys  and so I may wel deme
he is ful iocunde  also dar I leye
Can he ought telle  a mery tale or tweye
with which he glade may  this compaignye
who sire my lord  ȝa ȝa withouten lye
he can of myrthe  and eke of iolytee
Nat but Inow  also sire trusteth me
And ȝe him knew  as wel as do I
Ȝe wolde wondre  how wel and craftily
he coude werke  and that in sondry wyse
He hath take on him  many a gret emprise  
which were ful hard  for any þat is heere
To brynge aboute  but they of him it lere
As homly as he ryt  amonges ȝow
If ȝe him knewe  it wolde be for ȝoure prow
Ȝe wolde nat forgon  his acqueyntaunce
ffor mechel good  I dar leye in balaunce
Al that I haue  in my possession
he is a man  of heigh discresion
I warne ȝow wel  he is a passyng man
wel quod oure hoost  I preye the telle me than
Is he a Clerk or noon  telle what he is
Nay  he is grettere than a Clerk  Iwys
  
Seide this ȝeman  and in wordes fewe
Hoost of his craft  somwhat I wol ȝow shewe
I seye my lord can  suche sotiltee
But al his craft  ȝe moun nat wyte of me
And somwhat helpe I ȝet  to his werkyng
That al this grounde  on which we ben ridyng
Til that we come  to Caunterbury Toun
he coude al clene  turnen vp so doun
And paue it al of siluer  and of golde
And whan this ȝeman  had this tale Itolde
Vnto oure host  he seide benedicite
This thyng  is wonder merueillous  to me
Syn þat thy lord  is of so heigh prudence
By cause of which  men shulde him reuerence
That of his worship  reweth he so lite
his ouer sloppe  nys nought worth a myte
As in effect  to him  so mot I go
It is al baudy  and tore also
Why is thy lord so sluttissh  I the preye
And is of power  bettre cloth to beye
If that his dede  acorded with thy speche
Telle me that  and I the biseche
 Why quod this ȝeman  wherto aske ȝe me
God helpe me so  for he shal neuere the
But I wol nat avowe  that I seye
And þerfore kepe it secree  I ȝow preye
he is to wys in feith  as I bileue
That þat is ouer doon  It wol nat preue
Aright  as Clerkes seyn  it is a vyce
werfore in that  I holde him lewed and nice  
ffor whan a man hath  ouer gret a wit
fful ofte him happeth to mysvsen it
So doth my lord  and that me greueth sore
God it amende  I can sey no more
 Therof no fors  good ȝeman  quod oure hoost
Syn of the conynge of thy lord þou woost
  
Telle how he doth  I preye the hertly
Syn that he is  so crafty  and so sly
Where dwelle ȝe  if it to telle be
In the subarbes of a Toun  quod he
lurkynge in hernes  and in lanes blynde
Where as theise robbours  and theise theues by kynde
holden here pryue  ferful residence
As they that durn nat shewen  here presence
So faren we  if I shal seye the sothe
Ȝet quod oure hoost  lat me talke to the
Why artow so discoloured  of thy face
Peter quod he  god ȝeue it harde grace
I am so vsed  in the fir to blowe
That it hath chaunged  my colour I trowe
I nam nat wont  in no myrour to prye
But swynke sore  and lerne multiplie
we blundren euere  and pouren in the fyre
And for al that  we faille of oure desire
ffor euere we lakke  oure conclusion
To mechel folk  we don illusion
And borwe gold  be it a pound or two
Or ten or twelue  and manye sommes moo
And maken hem wenen  atte leest weye
That of a pound  we coude make tweye
Ȝet is it fals  and ay we han good hope
It for to doon  and after it we grope
But that science  is so fer vs biforn
We moun nat  although we hadden sworn
It ouer take  it slit awey so faste
It wol vs make beggers  atte laste
Whil this ȝeman was thus  in this talkyng
This Chanoun drow him nere  and herd al thyng
Which this ȝeman spak  for suspecion
Of mennes speche  euere hadde this Chanon
ffor Caton seith  that he that gilty is
Demeth al thyng  be spoke of him Iwys    
That was the cause  he gan so ney him drawe
To his ȝeman  to herken al his sawe
And thus he seide  vnto his ȝeman thoo
holde þou thy pees  and speke no wordes moo
ffor if þou do  thow shalt it dere abye
Thow sclaundrest me heere  in this companye
And eke discouerest  þat þou shuldest hide
Ȝa quod oure hoost  telle on what so betide
Of al his thretenynge  rekke nat a myte
In feith quod he  no more I do but lyte
And whan this Chanon saw  it wolde nat be
But his ȝeman  wolde telle  his pryuete
he fledde awey  for verrey sorwe and shame
A quod the ȝeman  heere shal rise a game
Al that I can  anoon I wol ȝow telle
Syn he is gon  the foule fend him quelle
ffor neuere heereafter  wyl I with him mete
ffor peny ne for pound  I ȝow byhete
he þat me brought first  vnto that game
Er that he dye  sorwe haue he and shame
ffor it is ernest to me  be my feith

And ȝet for al my smert  and al my grief
ffor al my sorwe  labour  and meschief
I coude neuer leue it  in no wyse
Nowe wolde god my wyt  myght suffise
To tellen al  þat longeth to that art
And nathelees  ȝow wil I tellen part
Syn þat my lord is gon  I wyl nat spare
Swich thyng as that I knowe  I wil declare
With this Chanon  I dwelt haue seuene ȝere
And of his science  am I neuere the nere
Al that I had  I haue lost therby
And god wot  so han many moo than I
There I was wont  to be right fressh and gay
Of clothynge  and of othere good array
Now may I were  an hose  vpon myn hed
And where my colour was  bothe fressh and red
Now is it wan  and of a leden hewe  
Who so it vseth  sore shal he rewe
And of my swynk  ȝet blered is myn eye
lo which a vauntage is  to multiplie
That slydyng science  hath me mad so bare
That I haue no good  where so euere I fare
And ȝet I am endetted so  therby
Of gold  that I haue borwed  trewely
That whil I lyue  I shal it quyte neuere
lat euery man  be war by me  for euere
What maner man  þat casteth him therto
If he continue  I holde his thrift Ido
ffor so helpe me god  þerby shal he nat wynne
But empte his purs  and make his wittes thynne
And whan he thurgh his madnesse  and folye
hath loost his owne good  thurgh Iupartie
Thanne he exciteth  othere folk therto
To lese here good  as he him self hath do
ffor vnto shrewes  ioye it is and ese
To haue here felawes  in peyne and dissese
  
Thus was I ones lerned  of a Clerk
Of that  no charge  I wil speke of oure werk
 Whan we ben there  as we shuln excersise
Oure eluyssh craft  we semen wonder wyse
Oure termes ben so clergeal  and queynte
I blowe the fyr  til that myn hert feynte
What shulde I telle  eche proporcion
Of thynges  which that we  werche vpon
As on fyue  or sexe vnces  may wel be
Of siluer  or sum other quantitee
And bisie me  to telle ȝow the names
Of Orpement  brent bones  Iron squames
That into poudre  grounden be ful smal
And in an erthene pot  how put is al
And salt Iput In  and also papere
Biforn these poudres  þat I speke of heere
And wel Icouered  with a laumpe of glas
And meche other thyng  which þat þere was
As of the pot  and glasses enlutynge
That of the eyr  myght passe out no thynge
And of the esy fyr  and smert also
which þat was made  and of the care and woo
That we hadde  in oure maters sublymyng
And in amalgamyng  and calcenyng  
And of quyk siluer  Icleped Mercurie crude
ffor alle oure sleightes  we can nat conclude
Oure Orpement  and sublimed Mercurie
Oure grounden litarge eke  on the porfurie
And eche of theise  vnces a certeyne
Nat helpeth vs  oure labour is in veyne
Ne eke oure spirites  ascencion
Ne oure maters  þat lyn al fix adoun
Moun in oure werkynge  no thyng vs availle
ffor loost is al oure labour  and trauaille
And al the cost  a twenty deuel weye
Is loost also  which we vpon it leye
  
There is also  ful many another thyng
That is vnto oure craft  appertenyng
Though I be ordre  hem nat reherce can
By cause that I am  a lewed man
Ȝet wole I telle hem  as they come to mynde
Though I ne can nat  sette hem in here kynde
As Bole Armonyak  verdegres  Boras
And sundry vesselles  mad of erthe and glas
Oure Vrinales  and oure descensories
Violes  crosletȝ  and sublimatories
Cucurbitȝ  and alambikes eke
And othere suche  dere Inow aleke
Nat nedeth it  for to reherce hem alle
Watres rubifyng  and Booles galle
Arsenyk  salarmonyak  and Brymston
And Erbes coude I telle eke  many oon
As Egremoyne  Valerian  and lymarie
And othere swich  if þat me list tarie
Oure laumpes brenne  bothe nyght and day
To brynge aboute oure purpos  if we may
Oure fourneys eke of calcinacion
And of watres  albificacion
Vnslekked lym  Chalk  and gleir of an ey
Poudres diuerse  asshes  donge  pisse  and cley
Sered pottes  salpetir vitriole
And diuerse fyres made  of wode and cole
Sal tartre  Alkaly  and salt preparat
And combust matiers  and coagulat
Cley  mad with hors and mannes her  and oyle
Of Tartre  Alumglas  Berm  wort  and Argule
Rysalger  and oure matiers embityng  
And eke of oure matiers  encorporyng
And of oure siluer  citrynacion
And of cementynge  and fermentacion
Oure Ingottes  testes  and manye moo
I wil ȝow telle  as was me taught also
  
The foure spiriteȝ  and the bodies seuene
By ordre  as ofte I herd my lord nemene
The first spirit  quyk siluer called is
The secund Orpement  the thridde Iwys
Sal Armonyak  and the ferthe Bremston
The bodyes seuene eke  lo hem heere anoon
Sol  gold is  and Luna siluer we threpe
Mars Iren  Mercurie quyksiluer we clepe
Saturnus led  and Iuppiter is Tyn
And venus Coper  by my fader kyn
This cursed craft  who so wil excersise
He shal no good haue  þat him may suffise
ffor al the good  he spendeth thereaboute
he lese shal  therof haue I no doute
who so þat listeth outren  his folie
lat him come forth  and lerne multiplie
And euery man  þat hath ought in his cofre
lat him appiere  and wexe a Philosophre
Ascauns that craft  is so light to lere
Nay nay god wot  al be he Monke or frere
Preest or Chanon  or any other wyght
Though he sitte at his book  bothe day and nyght 
In lernynge  of this eluyssh  nyce lore
Al is in veyn  and perde mechel more
To lerne a lewed man  this subtilitee
ffy  spek nat therof  for it wil nat be
And cone he letterure  or cone he noon
As in effect  he shal fynde it al oon
ffor bothe two  by my sauacion
Concluden  in multiplicacion
Ilike wel  whan they han al Ido
This is to seyn  they faillen bothe two
Ȝet forgat I  to make rehersail
Of watres Corosif  and of lymail
And of bodies  mollificacion
And also  of here induracion  

To telle all wold passe ony byble
That ougher is  wherfore as for þe best
Of all thise names  now woll I me rest
ffor as I trowe  I haue yow told ynough
To reise a feend  all loke he neuer so rough
A nay let be  the Philizophres stone
Elixer cleped  we sechen fast ecchone
ffor hade we hym  þan were we seker ynow
But vnto god of heuen I make a vow
ffor all our craft whan we haue all do
And all our sleight he woll nat com vs to
He hath ymade vs spenden mochell gode  
ffor sorow of which  allmost we wexen wode
But that gode hope  krepeth in our hert
Supposing euere  þough we sore smert
To be releued  by hym afterwarde
Soch supposyng  and hope is sharpe and harde
I warne you wele  it is to sechen euere
That futer tens  hath made men disceuere
In trust thereof  from all that euer þey hadde
Yitte of þat art þey can nat wexen sadde
ffor vnto hem  it is  a bitter sweete
So semeth it  for ne hade þey but a shete
Which þat þey myght  wrape hem in at nyght
And a brat  to walk in  by daylight
They wold hem sell  and spenden on þis craft
They con nat stynt tyll no thyng be laft
And euermore  where þat euere they goon
Men mow hem knowe  by smell of brymstoon
ffor all the world  þey stynken as þe goot
Her sauour is so  rammyssh and so hoot
That though a man  a myle from hem be
The savour woll enfecte hem  trusteth me
As thus by smell  and thredebare array
Yf that men lust  this folk they knowen may
  
And yf a man  woll aske hem priuely
Why they ben clothed so vnthriftely
They right anoon woll rownen in his ere
And seyn  yf þey espied were
Men wold hem slee  bycause of her science
lo thus this folk betrayen Innocence
Passe ouere this  I go my tale vntoo
On that our pot be on the fire ydoo
Of metals  with a certeyn quantitee
My lorde hem tempreth  and no man but he
Now he is goon I dare sey boldely
ffor as men seyn  he can do craftely
Algate I wote wele  he hath soch a name
and yitte full oft he renneth in a blame
And wote ye how  full oft it happeth so
The pot tobreketh  and farewele all is goo 
Thise metals ben  of so grete violence  
Our walles mow nat make hem resistence
But yf they weren wrought of lyme and stoon
They percen so  and thurgh the wall þey goon
And som of hem  synk into the ground
Thus han we lost  by tymes  many a pound
And som arn skatered  all the flore about
Som lepe into the roof  withouten dout
Though þat the fende  nat in our sight hym shewe
I trowe he with vs be  that ylk shrewe
In hell  where he lorde is and syre
Nys ther more woo  ne more rancour  ne Ire
Whan þat our pot  is broke  as I haue seid
Euery man chitte  and halt hym evill appayed
Som seyn  it was long on the fire makyng
Som seiden nay  it was on the blowyng
Than was I ferde  for that was myn office
Strawe koth the thirde  ye be leude and nyce
It was nat tempred  as it was wont to be
Nay koth the feerth stynt and herken me
  
By cause  our fire was nat made of beche
That is the cause  and none other syth eche
I can nat tell  whereon it was long
But wele I wote grete stryf  is vs among
What koth my lord  there nys no more to doon
Of thise perels  I woll be ware eftsoon
I am right seker  þat þe pot war crased
Be as be may  be ye no thing amased
As vsage is  let swepe þe flore as swythe
Pluk vp your hertes  and beth glad and blythe
The mullok on an hepe  ysweped was
And on the flore yeast a Canvas
And all this mullok in a seue Ithrowe
And syfted and ypiked  many a throwe
Parde koth one  somwhat of our metall
Yitte is ther here  þough þat we han nat all
and though this thyng  myshapped haue as now
Another tyme  it may be wele ynow
Vs most put our gode  in auenture
A Merchaunt parde  may nat ay endure 
Trusteth wele me  in his prosperitee  
Som tyme his gode  is drowned in the see
And som tyme  comth it sauf vnto the lond
Pees koth my lord  þe next tyme I woll fond
To bryng our Craft all in another plite
And but I doo  let me han the wyte
There was defaute  in somwhat wele I wote
Another seid  the fire was to hote
But be it hote or cold  I dare sey this
That we concluden euermore amys
We faill of that  which þat we wold haue
And in our madnes  euermore we raue
And whan we ben  togiders euerychoon
Euery man semeth  a Salamon
But euery thyng which þat shyneth as þe goold
Nys nat goold  as I haue herd toold
  
Ne euery appull  þat is faire at yie
Ne is nat gode  what so we clap or crye
Ryght so lo  fareth it amonges vs
He þat semeth the wisest by Ihesus
Is most fool  whan it comth to þe preef
And he þat semeth truest is a theef
That shull ye knowe  or þat I from you wende
Be that I of my tale  haue made an ende

Amonges vs  wold infect all a toun
Though it as grete were  as was Nynyvee
Rome Alisaundre Troye  and other thre
His sleightes  and his infinyte falsnesse
There coude no man writen  as I gesse
Though that he lyve myght a thousand yere
In all this world of falshede  nas his pere
ffor in his termes  he so woll hym wynde
And speke his wordes  in so slye a kynde
Whan he common shall  with ony wyght
That he woll make doten  anoon ryght
But it a feend be  as hymseluen is
ffull many a man  hath he begiled or this
And woll  yf þat he lyve may a while
And yitte men ride and goon  full many a myle 
Hym for to seke  and haue his aqweyntaunce  
Nat knowyng of his fals gouernaunce
And yf ye lyst  to yeve me audience
I woll it tell here  in your presence
But worshipfull Chanons religious
Ne demeth nat  þat I sklaundre your hous
allthough that my tale  of a chanon be
Of euery ordre som shrewe is pardee
And god forbede  þat all a companye
Shold folow a singler mannes folye
To sclaundre you  is no thing myn intent
But to correcten  þat is mys yment
  
This tale  was nat onely  told for yow
But eke for other moo  yee wote wele how
That among cristes Apostles xij
There was no traytour  but Iudas hym selue
Than why shold  þe remenaunt han a blame
That giltles were  by you sey I þe same
Saue onely this  yf ye woll herken me
Yf ony Iudas  in your Couent be
Remeveth hym be tymes I yow rede
Yf shame or loos  may causen ony drede
And be no thyng dysplesed I you prey
But in this caas  herkeneth wat I shall sey
In london was a preest  annielere
That therein dwelled had  many a yere
Which was so plesaunt and so seruysable
vnto the wyf where  as he was at þe table
That she wold suffre hym  no thing for to pay
ffor borde ne clothyng went he neuer so gay
And spendyng siluer  hade he right ynow
Thereof no force  I woll procede as now
And tell forth my tale of the Chanon
That brought this preest to confusion
This fals Chanon  cam vpon a day
vnto the prestes Chambre where he lay
Bysechyng hym  to lene hym a certein
Of gold  and he wold qwyte it hym ayein
leene me a mark  but dayes thre
And at my day  I woll it qwyten thee 
And yf so be  þou fynde me fals  
Another day  hang me by the hals
The preest hym toke  a mark and that as swythe
And þis Chanon hym thanked often sythe
And toke his leve  and went forth his weye
And at þe iijde day  brought his moneye
And to this preest he toke this gold agein
Whereof this preest was wonder glad and feyn
  
Certes koth he  no thing noyeth me
To lene a man a noble  or ij or iij
Or what thyng were in my possession
Whan he so trewe is  of condicion
That in no wise  he breke woll his day
To soch a man  I can neuere sey nay
What koth this Chanon shold I be vntrewe
Nay that were thyng yfall all of newe
Treuth is a thyng that I woll euere kepe 
Into that day  in which þat I shall krepe
Into my grave  and elles god forbede
Byleueth this  as seker as your crede
God thank I and in gode tyme be it seid
That there was neuer man yitte euyll appayed
ffor gold ne siluer  þat he to me lent
Ne neuere falshede  in myn hert Iment
And sir koth he  now of my pryvytee
Sen ye so godely  han ben vnto me
And kythed to me  so grete gentillesse
Somwhat  to quyte with your kyndenesse
I woll yow shewe  yf þat yow list lere
I woll yow teche pleynly the manere
How I can werken  in philisophie
Taketh gode hede  ye shull wele seen at yie
That I woll don a maistrie or I goo
ya koth þe prest  yee sir and woll ye soo
Marie thereof I pray yow hertly
at your commaundement sir truely
koth þe Chanon  and elles god forbede
Lo how þis þeef cowde his seruice bede
ffull soth it is  þat soch profred seruice
Stynketh  as witnessen þise old wise
And that full sone  I woll it vercifie  
In this Chanon  rote of all trecherie
That euermore delite hath  and gladnesse
Soch fendly thoughtes  in his hert empresse
  
How Cristes peple  he may to myschief bryng
God kepe vs from his fals dissimulyng
Nat wist this preest  with whom þat he delt
Ne of his harme commyng  he no thyng felt
O sely preest o sely Innocent
With Couetise anoon  þou shalt be blent
O graceles  full blynd is thy conseyt
No thyng  ne art þou ware of the disceyt
Which that this fox  yschapen hath to þe
His wily wrenches  þou ne maist nat flee
Wherfore to go  to the conclusion
That referreth to thy confusion
Vnhappy man  anone I woll me hye
To tell thyn vnwitte  and thy folye
and eke þe falsnesse of þat other wrecche
As ferforth  as that my connyng  woll strecche
This Chanon  was my lord ye wold wene
Sir hoost in feith  and by þe hevenes quene
It was another Chanon  and nat he
That can an hundred fold more subteltee
He þat hath betrayed folkes many tyme
Of his falsnesse it dulleth me to ryme
Ever whan that I speke of his falshede
ffor shame of hym my chekes  wexen rede
Algates they begynne for to glowe
ffor redness  haue I noon  right wele I knowe
In my visage  for fumes diuerse
Of metals  which ye han herd me reherce
Consumed and wasted han my rednesse
Now take hede  of this Chanons cursednesse
Sir koth the Chanon  let your man goon
ffor qwyksiluer  þat we it hade anoon
And let hym bryng ounces  ij or iij
And whan he comth as fast shull ye see
A wonder thyng  which ye sawe neuere or this
Sir koth the preest it shall be don ywis
  
He bade his seruaunt  fecch hym this thyng  
And he all redy was  at his biddyng
And went hym forth  and cam anon ayein
With his qwyksylver shortly for to seyn
And toke thise ounces thre  to the Chanon
And he hem leid faire and well adoun
And bade the seruaunt coles for to bryng
That he anoon myght  go to his werkyng
The coles right anoon weren yfette
And this Chanon toke out a Crosselette
Of his bosom  and shewed it to þe preest
This Instrument  koth he which þat þou seest
Take in thyn honde  and put thy self þerein
Of this qwyksiluere an ounce  and there begyn
In þe name of Crist  to wex a Philiȝophre
There ben full fewe  which þat I wold profre
To shewe hym thus moch of my science
ffor ye shull se here  by experience
That this qwyksyluer  I shall now mortefye 
Right in your sight anoon withouten lye
And make it as gode siluer  and as fyne
As þere is ony  in your purs and myne
Or elles where  and make it mallable
And elles holdeth me fals  and vnable
Amonges folk  for euere to appiere
I haue a poudre here  þat cost me dere
Shall make all gode  for it is cause of all
My kunnyng  which I to you shewe shall
voyde your man  and let hym be there out
and shette þe dore  whiles we ben about
Our pryvitee  þat no man vs espie
Whiles þat we werk in þis Philosophie
all as he bad fulfilled was in dede
This ylk seruaunt anon right out yede
And his maister shette þe dore anoon
And to her labour spedely they goon
  
This preest at þis cursed chanons biddyng
vpon þe fire  anon set this thyng
And blewe þe fire  and besied hym full fast
And þis Chanon  into the Crosselet cast
A poudre  note I whereof  it was  
Ymade  outher of chalk  outher of glas
Or somwhat elles  was nat worth a flie
To blynd with the preest  and bad hym hie
The coles for to couchen all aboue
The Crosselet for in tokenyng and the loue
koth this Chanon  þyn owen handes two
Shull werche all thyng þat shall here be do 
Graunt mercy koth the preest and was full glad
And couched cole  as þat þe chanon bad
And while he besy was  this sely wrecche
This fals Chanon  þe foule fende hym fecche
Out of his bosom  toke a bechen cole
In which full subtelly  was made an hole
And therein put was of siluere lemaill
An ounce  and stopped was withouten faill
This hole with wexe to kepe þe lemaill in
And vnderstondeth  þat þis fals gyn
was nat made there  but it was made byfore
And other thynges  that I shall tell more
Hereafterward  which þat hewith hym brought
Or he cam there  hym to begile he thought
And so he did or þat þey were atwynne
Tyll þat he hade  terued hym  coude he nat blyn
It dulleth me  whan þat I of hym speke
Of his falshede  fayn wold I me wreke
Yf I wist how  but he is here and there
He is so variaunt he abytte nowhere
But taketh hede  now sirs  for goddes love
He toke his cole  of which I spake above
And in his hande  he bare it priuelye
And whiles þe preest  couched beselye
  
The coles  as I told you  or this
This Chanon seid frend  ye don amys
This is nat couched  as it ought to be
But sone I shall amenden it koth he
Now let me medle therewith  but a while
ffor of yow haue I pitee  by seint Gyle
Ye ben right hote  I se wele how ye swete
Haue here a cloth  and wipe awey þe wete
And whiles that the preest wyped his face  
This Chanon toke his cole  with sory grace
And leid it aboue  vpon þe mydward
vpon the Crosselet and blew wele afterward
Tyll that þe coles  gan fast brenne
Now yeve vs drynk koth þe Chanon thenne
As swythe  all shall be wele I vndertake
Sitte we doun  and let vs mery make
And whan that this Chanons  bechen cole
was brent all þe lemaill out of þe hole
Into þe Croselet  fell anoon adoun
And so it most nedes be  by resoun
Sen it so even aboue  it couched was
But thereof wist þe preest nothyng allas 
He demed all coles eliche gode
ffor of þat sleight he nothing vnderstode
And whan this  Alcamistre sawe his tyme
Rise vp koth he sir preest and sit by me
And for I wote wele Ingot haue we noon
Goth forth walketh  and bryng vs a chalk stoon
ffor I woll make  of þe same shappe
That is an yngot  yf I may haue happe
And bryngeth eke with you  a bolle or a pan
ffull of water  and ye shull see wele þan
How þat our besynesse  shall thryve or preeve
And yitte for ye shull haue no mysbyleve
Ne wrong conceyt of me in your absence
I ne woll nat bene out of your presence
  
But go with you and com with yow ayein
The Chambre dore  shortly for to seyn
They opened and shette  and went her weye
And forth with hem þey carieden þe keye 
And commen ayein without delay
What shold I tarien  all þe long day
He toke the chalk  and shope it in þe wise
Of an Ingot as I shall yow devise
I sey he toke out of his owen sleve
A teyne of siluer euyll mot he cheve
Which þat ne was  but an vnce of weight
And taketh hede now of his cursed sleight
He shoope his Ingotte  in lenth  and in brede  
Of this teyne  without ony drede
So sliely þat the preest it nat espied
And in his sleve ayein  he gan it hied
And from the fire  he toke vp his matere
And in þe Ingot put it with mery chere
And in the watery vessell  he it cast
Whan that hym lyst and bade þe preest as fast
What there is  put in thyn hande and groope
Thow fynd shalt there  silver as I hoope
    
    
He put his hand in  and toke vp a teyne
Of silver fyn  and glad  in euery veyne
Was this preest whan he sawe it was so
Goddes blessyng and his moders also
And all halowes  haue ye sir Chanon
Seid this preest and I her malison
But and ye vouchesauf  to techen me
This noble craft and this subteltee
I woll be your  in all þat euer I may
Koth the Chanon  yitte woll I make assay
The secund tyme  þat ye mow taken hede
And ben expert of this  and in your nede
  
Another day assay  in myn absence
This disciplyne  and þis crafty science
let take another ounce  koth he tho
Of qwyksiluere  without wordes mo
And do therewith  as ye haue don or this
with þat other  which þat now siluer is
This preest hym besieth in all þat he can
To don as þis Chanon  this cursed man
Commaunded hym  and fast blew the fire
ffor to com to theffect  of his desire
And þis Chanon  right in þe mene while
All redy was  this preest efte to begyle
And for a a countenaunce  in his hande he bare
An holowen styk  take kepe and beware
In þe ende of which  an once and no more
Of siluer lemaill  put was  as byfore
Was in his cole  and stopped with wex wele
ffor to kepe in his lemaill euery dele
And while this preest was in his besynesse  
This Chanon with his styk gan hym dresse 
To hym anon  and his poudre cast in 
As he dyd ere  þe devyll out of his skyn
Hym terne  I pray to god for his falshede
ffor he was fals  in euery thyng and dede
And with his styk aboue þe Crosselet
That was ordeyned  with þat fals get
He stered the coles  till relent gan
The wexe ayeinst the fire  as euery man
But it a fole be  wote wele þat it mot nede
And all þat in the styk was out yede
And in þe Crosselette hastely fell
Now gode sirs  what woll ye bet þan well
Whan þat þis preest was þus begiled ayein
Supposyng nat but trouth  þe soth to seyn
He was so glad  þat I can nat expresse
In no manere  his merth and his gladnesse
  
And to þe Chanon  he profred eftsone
Body and gode  ya koth þe Chanon sone
Though I pore be  crafty þou shalt me fynd
I warne the yitte  is there more behynd
Is there ony Coper  herein seid he
Ye koth the preest I trowe well there be
Elles go by vs som  and þat as swythe
Now sir go þy wey  and hie the blythe
He went his way  and with the coper cam
And þis Chanon it  in his handes nam
And of that Coper weyed out but an ounce
all to symple is my tung to pronounce
As mynystre of my wit  þe doublenesse
Of this Chanon  rote of all cursednesse
He semed frendly to hem  þat knewe hym nought
But he was fendly  both in hert and thought
It werieth me  to tell of his falnesse
And natheles yitte woll I it expresse
To thentent that men mow be ware thereby
And for noon other cause truely
He put the ounce of Coper in þe Crosselet
And on the fire  as swythe he hath it set
And cast in poudre  and made the preest to blowe  
And in his werkyng for he stowped lowe
As he did ere  and all nas but a Iape
Right as hym list the preest he made his ape
And afterward in þe Ingotte  he it cast
And in the pan  put it at the last
With the water  and in he put his owen hand
And in his sleue  as ye byforehand
Herd me tell  hade a siluer teyne
He slyely toke it out þis cursed hyne
vnwetyng this prest of his fals craft
And in þe pannes botom  he hath it laft
And in the water  rombled to and froo
And wondir priuely toke vp also
  
The Coper Teyne  nat knowyng þis preest
And hid it  and hym hent by the brest
And to hym spake  and thus seid in his game
Stoupeth adoun  by god ye be to blame
Helpeth me now  as I did yow whilere
Put in your hande  and loke what is there
This preest toke vp þis siluer teyne anoon
And than seid the Chanon let vs goon
With thise iij teynes  which þat we han wrought
To som goldsmyth  and wete yf they ben ought
ffor by my feith  I nold  for myn hode
But yf þat þey were siluer fyn and gode
And þat as swythe  preued shall it be
Vnto þe goldsmyth with thise teynes iij
They went and put thise teynes in assay
To fire and hamer  myght no man sey nay
But þat þey weren  as hem ought to be
This sotted preest whoo was gladder þan he
Was neuer bird gladder  ayeinst the day
Ne nyghtyngale  in the seson of May
Was neuer noon  þat list bet to syng
Ne lady lustier  in karolyng
Or for to speke of loue  and wommanhede
Ne knyght in armes  don a doughty dede
To stonde in grace  of his lady dere
Than hade this preest þis sory craft to lere 
And to this Chanon  thus he spake and seid  
ffor the loue of god  that for vs all deid
And as I may deserue it vnto yow
What shall this resceit cost telleth now
By our lady koth this Chanon it is dere
I warn yow wele  for save I and a frere
In Engelond  there can no man it make
No force koth he  now sir for goddes sake
what shall I paye  telleth me I pray
Iwys koth he  it is full dere I say
  
Sir at a worde  yf þat the list it haue
ye shull paye xl li so god me save
And ner the frenshippe  þat ye did or this
To me ye shold paye more ywys
This prest  þe som of xl li anoon
Of nobles fette  and toke hem euerychoon
To this Chanon  for this ylk resceyt
All his werkyng nas but fraude and disceyt
Sir preest he seid  I kepe haue no loos
Of my Craft for I wold it kept were cloos
And as ye loue me  kepeth it secree
ffor and men knewe  all my subteltee
By god þey wold haue so grete envye
To me  by cause of my philosophie
I shold be dede  there were noon other weye
God it forbede koth þe preest  what ye seye
yitte hade I leuer spenden  all þe gode
Which þat I haue  and elles were I wode 
Than that ye shold fall  in soch myschief
ffor your gode will  sir haue ye right gode preef
koth the Chanon  and fare well graunt mercy
He went his wey  and neuere þe preest hym sye
After þat day  and whan þat þis preest shoold
Maken assay at soch tyme  as he wold
Of this resceit fare wele  it wold nat be
Lo thus beiaped and begiled was he
Thus maketh he  his Introduccion
To bryng folk to her destruccion
Considereth sirs  how þat in ecch astate
Bitwene men and gold there is debate
So ferforth so that vnneth is there noon  
This multeplying blynt so many oon
That in gode feyth  I trowe þat it be
The cause grettest of soch skarstee
As men reccorde  many mo than I
Philisophres speken so mystely
  
In this Craft þat men han now a dayes
They mow wele chittren  as þat doon Iayes
And in her termes sette her lust and peyne
But to her purpoos  shull þey neuere atteyne
A man may lightly lerne  yf he haue ought
To multiplye  and bryng his gode to nought
Lo soch a lucre it is  in this lusty game
A mans merth  it woll turne vnto grame
And empten also  grete and hevy purses
And maken folk  for to purchacen curses
Of hem that han her gode  þereto ylent
ffy for shame  þey þat han be brent
Allas can þey nat flee  þe fires hete
Ye þat it vse  I rede ye it lete
lest ye lese all for bet þan neuere  is late
Neuer to thryve  were to long a date
Though ye proll ay  ye shull it neuere fynde
Ye ben as bold as is bayard the blynde
That blundreth forth  and perell casteth noon
He is as bold to renne ayeinst a stoon
As for to go beside  in the hie weye
So faren ye that multiplie I seye
Yf þat your yien kon nat seen aright
loke þat your mynd  lak nat his sight
ffor though ye loke neuere so brode and stare
Ye shull no thyng wyn  on þat chaffare
But wasten all þat ye mow rappe and renne
withdrawe the fyre  lest it to fast brenne
Medleth no more with þat arte I mene
ffor yf ye do  your thryft is goon full clene
And right as swythe  I woll yow tellen here
What that the Philisophres seyn in þis matere
Lo thus seith Arnold of the newe toun
As his Rosarie  maketh mension
He seyth right thus without ony lye  
There may no man Mercurie mortefye
  
But it be with his brothers knowleccheyng
How þat he  which that first seid this thyng
Of philisophres  fader was Hermes
He seith how that the Dragon doutles
Ne dyeth nat but yf that he be slayn
with his brother  and þat is for to seyn
By the dragon Mercurie  and noon other
He vnderstode  and brymstone by his brother
That out of Sol and luna  were ydrawe
And therfore seid he  take hede to my sawe
Let no man besy hym  þis arte for to seche
But yf that  þe entencion and speche
Of Philisophres  vnderstonde can
And yf he do  he is  a lewde man
ffor this science  and this cunnyng koth he
Is of the secree  of secretes pardee
Also þere was a disciple of Plato
That on a tyme  seid his maister to
As his boke senior woll bere witnesse
And this was his demaund in sothfastnesse
Tell me þe name of þe priue stoon
And Plato answerd vnto hym anoon
Take a stone  that Tytanus men name
Which is that koth he  magnasia is þe same
Seid plato  ya sir  and is it thus
This is ignotum per ignocius
What is magnasia  gode sir I you prey
Is it a water  þat is made I sey
Of elymentes iiij koth plato
Tell me þe rote gode sir koth he þe
Of that water  yf it be your will 
Nay nay koth Plato  certeyn þat I nyll
The philisophres sworn were euerychoon
That þey shold discouere it into noon
Ne in no boke it write in no manere
ffor vnto crist it is so leef and dere
  
That he woll nat þat it discouered be
But where it lyketh  to his deytee 
Men for to espire  and eke for to defende  
Whom þat hym lyketh  lo this is the ende
Than conclude I thus  sen þat god of heven
Ne woll nat þat philisophres neven
How that a man  shall com vnto this stone
I rede vs for þe best let it gone
ffor who so maketh god his aduersarie
As for to werk ony thyng in contrarie
Of his will neuer shall he thryue
Though he multeplye terme of his lyve
And there appoynt for ended is my tale
God send euery true man bote of his bale 
Wot ye nat where  þere stant a litle toun
Which þat cleped is  bob vp and doun
Vnder the blee  in Caunterbury weye
There gan our hoost  for to iape and pleye
And seid sires what don is in the myre
There is no man for prayer ne for hyre
That woll awake  our felawes arn behynde
A theef myght full lightly robbe and bynde
Se how he nappeth  see for goddes bones
That he woll fall from his hors at ones
Is þat a coke of london  with meschaunce
Do hym com forth he knoweth his penaunce
ffor he shall tell a tale by my fay
allþough it be nat worth a botell hay
Awake þou koke sit vp  god yeue þe sorow
What ayleth the to slepe by þe morow
Hast þou had fleen all nyght or art þou dronk
Or haast þou with som quene  all nyght yswonk
So that þou maist nat  hold vp þyn hede
This Cook þat was pale and no þing rede
Seid to our hoost as god my soule blesse
As there is fall on me  soch heuynesse
Note I nat why  but me were leuer slepe  
Than the best galon wyn  þat is in chepe
  
Well koth þe maunciple  yf I may do ese
To the Sir Cook and no wight displese
Which that here rideth  in this company
And our hoost wold of his curtesy
I wold as now excuse þe of þy tale
ffor in gode feith þy visage is full pale
Thyn yien dasen eke  as me thynketh
And wele I wote  thy breeth full foule stynketh
That sheweth wele  þou art nat wele disposed
Of me certeyn þou shalt nat be glosed
See how he yaneth  see þis drunken wight
As though he wold swalow vs anoon ryght
Hold cloos þy mouth for thy fader kyn
The deuell of hell  set his fote therein
Thy cursed breth  effecte woll vs all
ffy stynkyng Swyn  foule mot þe fall
A taketh hede sirs  of this lusty man
Now swete sir  woll ye iust at þe fan
Thereto me thynketh ye ben right wele yshape
I trowe ye drunk haan  wyn of ape
And þat is whan men pleye with a strawe
And with his speche  þe Cooke wax angrye and wrawe
And on þe maunciple gan to nodde fast
ffor lak of speche  and doun þe hors hym cast
where as he lay  tyll þat hym men vptoke
This was a faire Chyuache of a Cooke
Allas þat he hade nat hold hym by his ladle
And or þat he ayein were  in his sadle
There was grete shovyng to and froo
To lyft hym vp  and moch care and woo
So vnweldy  was þis sory palled goost
And to þe Maunciple  þan spake our hoost
By cause that drynk hath dominacion
vpon this man  by my savacion
I trowe he leudly  tell woll his tale
ffor were it wyn  or strong musty ale
  
That he drank he speketh in his nose
He snuffeth fast and eke he hath the pose
He hath also to do more than ynough  
To kepe hym  in his sadle out of þe slough
And yf he fall from his caple eft sone
Than shull we all han ynough to done
In lyftyng vp  his hevy drunken cors 
Tell on thy tale  of hym make I no fors
But yitte Maunciple  in feith þou art to nyce
Thus openly  to repreve hym  of his vyce
Another day  he woll perauenture
Reclayme the  and bryng þe to lure
I mene  he speke woll  of smale thynges
And for to pynchen  at thy rekenynges
That were nat honest  yf it cam to preef
koth þe Maunciple  þat were a grete myschief
So myght he lyghtly  bryng me in þe snare
Yitte hade me leuer  pay for þe mare
which þat he rytte on  þan he shold with me stryue
I woll nat wratth hym  as mot I thryue
That  þat I spake  I seid it in my bourde
And wete ye what I have here in my gourde
A draught of wyn  it is  of a ripe grape
And right anoon  ye shull se a gode iape
This Coke shall drynk þereof yf I may
vp peyne of deth  he woll nat sey me nay
And certenly to tell as it was
Of this vessell  þe Cooke  drank fast allas
what nedeth it  he drank ynough byforn
And whan he hade pouped  in his horn
To the Maunciple  he toke þe gourde agayn
And of that draught  þe Cook was wonder fayn
And thanked hym  in soch wise as he coude
Than gan our hoost  to laugh wonder loude
And seid I se wele  it is necessarie
Where þat we goo  gode drynk with vs to carie
  
ffor þat woll turne rancour and disese
To accorde and loue  and many a rancour pese
O þou Bacus  blessed be thy name
That so canst turne  ernest into game
Worshipe and thank be  vnto thy deitee
Of that mater ye gete no more for me
Tell on thy tale Maunciplie I the prey  
Wele sir koth he  now herken what I sey
WHan Phebus was dwellyng in erth adoun
As old bokes maken mensyoun
He was þe most lusty bachelere
In all this world  and eke þe best Archiere
He slough anoon þe serpent Phiton as he lay
Slepyng ayeinst þe son  vpon a mery day
And many another noble  worthy dede
He with his bowe wrought  as men mow rede
Pleyen he coude  on euery mynstralsye
And syngen þat it was a melodye
To heren of his clere voice the soun
Certes the kyng of Thebes Amphyoun
That with his syngyng walled þat Citee
Coude neuere syngen half so wele as hee
Thereto he was  the semeliest man
Thas is or was  sen þat þe world began
What nedeth it  his fetures to discryve
ffor in this world  was noon so faire on lyve
He was therewith fulfilled of gentillesse
Of honour  and of perfite worthynesse
This Phebus  that was flour of bachelrye
As wele in fredom  as in Chiualrye
ffor his desport in signe of victorie
O Phiton  so as telleth vs þe storie
Was wont to bere in his hande a bowe
Now hade þat Phebus in his hous a crowe
Which in a cage  he fustred many a day
And taught it speke  as þat men teche a Iay
  
White was this Crowe  as is a snowewhite swan
And countrefete þe speche of euery man
He coude  whan he shold tell a tale
Therewith in all þis werld  no nyghtyngale
Ne cowde by an hundred thousand dele  
Syngen so wonder merely and wele
Now had this Phebus  in his hous a wyf
Which that he loved more than his lyf
And nyght and day  dyd ever his diligence
Hir for to plese  and doon hir reuerence
Save onely  yf the soth  that I shall seyn
Ielous he was  and wold haue kept hir feyn
ffor hym were loth byiaped  for to be
And so is euery wight  in soch degree
But all for nought  for it availeth nought
A gode wyf  þat is clene  of werk and thought
Shold nat be kept  in noon awaite certein
And truely  the labour is in veyn
To kepe a shrewe for it woll nat be
This hold I for a verray nycetee
To spille labour  for to kepe wyves
Thus writen old clerkes in her lyves
But now to purpos  as I first began
This worthy Phebus  doth all þat he can
To plese hir  wenyng þat soch plesaunce
And for his manhode  and his gouernaunce
That no man shold  haue put hym from his grace
But god it wote  there may no man embrace
As to destreyne  a thyng which þat nature
Hath naturelly  sette in a creature
Take ony bird  and put it in a kage
And do all thyn intent  and þy corage
To fustre it tenderly  with mete and drynk
Of all deyntees  þat þou canst bethynk
And kepe it as clenly  as þou may
Allthough his cage of gold be neuere so gay
  
Yitte hade this bird by xx thousand fold
leuer in a fforest þat is rude and cold
Goo ete wormes  and soch wrecchednesse
ffor euere þis bird woll don his besynesse
To escape out of his cage yf þat he may
His libertee  this bird desireth ay
Let take a Cat  and fostre hym well with mylk
And tendre flessh  and make his couche of sylk
And let hym seen a mous  go by the wall   
Anoon he weyueth mylk and flessh and all
And euery deyntee  that is in that hous
Soch apetyte hath he  to ete the mous
lo here hath lust his dominacion
And appetite  flemeth discrecion
A she wolf hath also  a velens kynd
The lewdest wolf þat she may fynd
Or leest of reputacion  þat woll she take
In tyme whan þat hir list to han a make
All thise ensaumples  speke I by thise men
That ben vntrewe  but no thyng by wommen
ffor men han euere  a likerous appetite
On lower thyng  to perfourme her delite
Than on her wyfes  ben þey neuere so feire
Ne neuere so true  ne so deboneire
fflessh is so newe fangell with meschaunce
That we ne con  in no thyng haue plesaunce
That sowneth into vertue ony while
This Phebus  which þat þough vpon no gyle
Disceyued was  for all his iolytee
ffor vnder hym  another hade she
A man of litle reputacion
Nat worth to Phebus in comparison
The more harme is  it happeth often so
Of which there comth  mochell harme and woo
And so byfell  whan Phebus was absent
His wyf anoon  hath for hir lemman sent
  
Hir lemman sertes  þis is a knavyssh speche
fforyeue it mee  and þat I you beseche
The wise Platoo  seith as ye mow rede
The worde mot nede accorde with þe dede
Yf men shull proprely  tell a thyng
The worde mot Cosyn be  to þe werkyng
I am a boystous man  right thus sey I
There nys  noon other difference  truly
Bitwene a wyf þat is of hye degree
Yf of hir body  dishonest she bee
And a pouere wenche other þan this
Yf so be þe werken both amys
But that the gentile  in estate aboue  
She shall be cleped his lady  as in love
And for that other is a poure womman
She shall be cleped his wenche  or his lemman
And god it wote  myn owen dere brother
Men leyn þat one  as lowe  as lith þat other
Right so bitwene  a titeles tyraunt
And an outlawe  or a theef erraunt
The same I sey  there is no difference
To Alisaundre  told was this sentence
That for the tyraunt is of gretter myght
By force of meynee  for to slee doun ryght
And bren hous and home  and make all pleyn
Lo therefore is he cleped a Capiteyn
And for the Outlawe hath  but small meynee
And may nat do  so grete an harme as hee
Ne bryng a cuntree  to so grete myschief
Men clepe hym an outlawe  or a theef
But for I am a man  nat Textuele
I woll nat tell of textes neuer a dele
I woll go to my tale  as I began
Whan phebus wyf  hade sent for hir lemman
And they wroughten  all her lust volage
The white crowe  þat hyng ay in þe kage
  
Byheld her werk and seid neuer a word
And whan þat home was com  Phebus þe lord
The crowe sang Cukkow Cukkow Cukkow
What bird koth Phebus  what song syngest þou
Ne were þou wont so merely  to syng
That to my hert it was a reioysyng
To here þy voice  allas what song is this 
By god koth he I syng nat amys
Phebus koth he  for all þy worthynesse
ffor all þy beautee  and þy gentillesse
ffor all þy song  and all þy mynstralcye
ffor all þy waytyng  blered is thyn yie
With one of litle reputacion
Nat worth to the in comparison
The mountaunce of a gnatte so mot I thryve
ffor on thy bedde  þy wyf I sawe hym swyve 
What woll ye more  þe crowe anoon hym told  
By sadde tokenes  and by wordes bold
How þat his wyf  hade don hir leccherie
Hym to grete shame  and to grete velanye
And told hym eft  he saw it with his yien
This Phebus  gan awayward for to wrien
And thought his sorowfull hert brast a two
His bowe he bent and sette there in a floo
And in his Ire  his wyf  þan hath he slayn
This is theffect  there is no more to sayn
ffor sorow of which  he brake his mynstralsye
Both harpe and leute  gytern and sautrye
And eke he brake his arowes  and his bowe 
And after þat þus spake he to the Crowe
Traytour koth he  with tung of Scorpion
Thow hast me brought  to my confusion
Allas þat I was wrought  why nere I dede
O dere wyf  gemme  of lustihede
That were to me so sad  and eke so trewe
Now lyst  þou dede  with face pale of hewe
  
ffull giltles  þat durst I swere ywis 
O racle hond to don so foule a mys
O trouble witte  o Ire reccheles
That vnavised  smytest gyltles
O wantrust  full of fals suspecion
Where was thy witte  and þy discrecon
O euery man be ware of rakelnesse
Ne trowe no thing  without strong witnesse
Smyte nat so sone  or þat ye weten why
But beeth avised  well and soberly
Or ye don  ony execucion
Vpon your Ire  for suspecion
Allas a thousand folk han  for racle Ire
ffully fordone or brought hem in þe myre
Allas for sorow  I woll my self slee
And to the Crowe  o fals theef seid he
I woll þe qwyte anoon  þy fals tale
Thow song whilom like a nyghtyngale
Now shalt þou fals theef þy song forgone
And eke thy white fethers euerychone 
Ne neuer in all thy lyf  ne shalt þou speke   
Thus shull men  on a traytour ben awreke
Thow and þyn ofspryng  ever shull be blake
Ne neuer swete noise  shull ye make
But euer crie ayeinst  tempest and reyn
In tokenyng  þat þurgh þe  my wyf is sleyn
And to þe Crowe he stirt  and þat anoon
And pulled his white fethers of euerychoon
And made hym blak and reft hym all his song
And eke his speche  and out at the dore hym slong
Vnto þe devill  which I hym betake
And for this caas  ben all crowes blake 
Lordynges by this ensaumple I you preye
Beth ware and taketh kepe  what þat ye seye
Ne telleth never no man  in all your lyf
How þat another man  hath dyght his wyf 
  
He woll you hate  mortally certeyn
Daun Salamon  as wise clerkes seyn
Techeth a man  to kepe his tung well
But as I seid I am nat textewell 
But natheles  þus taught my dame
My son thynk on þe crowe a goddes name
My son kepe wele thy tung and kepe thy frende
A wykked tung is wers þan a feende
My son from a fend  men mow hem blesse
My son  god of his endlees godenesse
Walleth a tung with teeth  and lyppes eke
ffor a man shold hym avise  what he speke
My son full oft for to moch speche
Hath many a man ben spylt as clerkes teche
But for litle speche  avisely
Is no man shent to speke generally
My son þy tung sholdest þou restreyne
at all tymes  but whan þou dost þy peyne
To speke of god  in honour and prayere
The first vertue son yf þou wolt lere
Is to restreyne  and kepe wele þy tung
Thus lerne children  whan þat þey be yong
My sone of mochell spekyng evill avised
There lesse spekyng hade  ynough suffised
Comth moch harme  thus was me told and taught  
In mochell speche  synne ne wanteth nat
Wost þou nat whereof a racle tung serueth
Right as a swerd forkytteth  and kerueth
An arme a two  my dere son right so
A tung kytteth  frendship all a two
A iangeler is to god abhomynable
Rede Salamon  so wise and honourable
Rede Dauid in his psalmes  rede Senek
My son speke nat but with thyn hede þou bek
Dissimule as þou were deef yf þat þou here
A iangeler speke  of parlious matere
  
The flemmyng seith and lerne it yf the lest
That litle ianglyng causeth moch rest
My son  yf þou no wykked word hast seid
The dare nat drede  for to be bewreid
But he þat hath mysseyde  I dare wele seyn
He may by no waye  clepe his worde ageyn
Thyng þat is seid  is seid  and forth it goth
Though hym repent or be him leef or loth
He is his thrall  to whom þat he hath seid
A tale of which he is now evill appayed
My son be ware  and be noon auctor newe
Of tidynges whether þey be fals or trewe
Whereso þou com  amonges hie or lowe
Kepe well þy tung and thynk vpon þe crowe
By that þe Maunciple  hade his tale ended
The son from þe South lyne was discended
So lowe that he nas nat to my sight
Degrees ix  and xxty of hight
x of þe Clok  it was tho as I gesse
ffor xj fote  and litle more or lesse
My shadow was  at thilk tyme as there
Of soch fete  as my length parted were
In vj fete equall  of proporcion  
Therewith the mones exaltacion
I mene libra  allwey gan ascende
As we were entryng at a thorpes ende
ffor which our hoost as he was wont to gye
As in this caas  our ioly company
Seid in this wise  lordynges euerychone
Now lakketh vs no tales moo þan one
ffulfilled is my sentence  and my decree
I trowe þat we han herde in ecch degree
Allmost fulfilled is  all myn ordenaunce
I pray to god  so yeue hym right gode chaunce
That telleth this tale to vs lustely
Sir preest koth he  art þou a vicary
Or art þow parson  sey soth be thy fey
Be what þou be  ne breke þou nat our pley
  
ffor euery man saue þou  hath told his tale
Vnbokle and shewe vs  what is in þy male
ffor truely me thynketh  by þy chere
Thow sholdest knytte vp wele a grete matere
Tell vs a fable anon  for goddes bones
This parson answerd  all at ones
Thow getest fable noon ytold for me
ffor Poule þat writeth vnto Tymothe
Repreven hem  þat weyven sothfastnesse
And tellen fables  and soch wrecchednesse
Why shold I sowe draf out of my fyst
Whan I may sowe whete  yf þat me lyst
ffor which I sey  þat yf þou list to here
Moralitee and vertuous matere
And þan  that ye woll yeue me audience
I woll fayn  at cristes reuerence
Do yow plesaunce leefull as I can
But trusteth wele  I am a sothern man
I can nat geest rom  ram  ruf by lettre
Ne god wote  ryme hold I but litle better
And therfore yf þou list I woll nat glose
I woll yow tell a mery tale in prose
To knytte vp all þis feest and make an ende
And Ihesu for his grace  witte me sende
To shewe yow  þe weye in this viage  
Of thylk perfyte glorious pilgrymage
That hight Ierusalem celestiall
And yf ye vouchesauf anoon I shall
Begynne vpon my tale  for which I prey
Tell your avice  I can no better sey
But natheles  this meditacion
I put it ay  vnder correccion
Of clerkes  for I am nat textuell
I take but þe sentence  trusteth well
Therefore I make  a protestacion
That I woll stond  to correccion
  
Vpon this worde  we han assented sone
ffor as vs semed  it was to done
To enden  in som vertuous sentence
And for to yeve hym  space  and audience
And bad our hoost he shold to hym sey
That all we  to tell his tale hym prey
Our hoost hade þe wordes  for vs all
Sir prest koth he  now faire yow byfall
Sey what yow list and we woll gladly here
And with þat worde  he seid in þis manere
Telleth koth he your meditacon
But hasteth yow  þe son  woll adoun
Beth fructuous  and þat in litle space
And to do wele god send yow his grace
