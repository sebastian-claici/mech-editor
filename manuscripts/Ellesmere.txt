WHan that Aprille with hise shoures soote  
The droghte of March  hath perced to the roote
And bathed euery veyne  in swich licour
Of which vertu  engendred is the flour
Whan Zephirus eek  with his swete breeth
Inspired hath  in euery holt and heeth
The tendre croppes  and the yonge sonne
Hath in the Ram  his half cours yronne
And smale foweles  maken melodye
That slepen al the nyght  with open eye
So priketh hem nature in hir corages
Thanne longen folk  to goon on pilgrimage
And Palmeres  for to seken straunge strondes
To ferne halwes  kowthe in sondry londes
And specially  from euery shires ende
Of Engelond  to Caunturbury they wende
The hooly blisful martir for to seke
That hem hath holpen  whan þat they were seeke
Bifil that  in that seson on a day
In Southwerk  at the Tabard as I lay
Redy  to wenden on my pilgrymage
To Caunterbury  with ful deuout corage
At nyght  were come  in to that hostelrye
Wel nyne and twenty in a compaignye
Of sondry folk  by aventure yfalle
In felaweshipe  and pilgrimes were they alle
That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde


The chambres and the stables weren wyde
And wel we weren esed atte beste
And shortly  whan the sonne was to reste
So hadde I spoken  with hem everychon
That I was  of hir felaweshipe anon
And made forward  erly for to ryse
To take oure wey  ther as I yow deuyse
But nathelees  whil I haue tyme and space
Er that I ferther  in this tale pace
Me thynketh it acordaunt to reson
To telle yow  al the condicion
Of ech of hem  so as it semed me
And whiche they were  and of what degree
And eek in what array  that they were Inne
And at a knyght  than wol I first bigynne
Aknyght ther was  and that a worthy man
That fro the tyme  that he first bigan
To riden out  he loued chiualrie
Trouthe and honour  fredom and curteisie
fful worthy was he  in his lordes werre
And therto  hadde he riden  no man ferre
As wel in cristendom  as in Hethenesse  
And euere  honoured for his worthynesse
 At Alisaundre he was  whan it was wonne
fful ofte tyme  he hadde the bord bigonne
Abouen alle nacions in Pruce
In Lettow  hadde he reysed and in Ruce
No cristen man so ofte of his degree
In Gernade  at the seege eek hadde he be
Of Algezir  and riden in Belmarye
At Lyeys was he  and at Satalye
Whan they were wonne  and in the grete See
At many a noble Armee  hadde he be
At mortal batailles  hadde he been fiftene
And foughten for oure feith at Tramyssene
In lystes thries  and ay slayn his foo


This ilke worthy knyght hadde been also
Somtyme  with the lord of Palatye
Agayn  another hethen in Turkye
And eueremoore  he hadde a souereyn prys
And though þat he were worthy he was wys
And of his port  as meeke as is a mayde
He neuere yet  no vileynye ne sayde
In al his lyf  vn to no maner wight
He was a verray parfit gentil knyght
 But for to tellen yow  of his array
His hors weren goode  but he was nat gay
Of ffustian  he wered a gypon
Al bismotered with his habergeon
ffor he was late  ycome from his viage
And wente  for to doon his pilgrymage
With hym ther was his sone a yong Squier
A louyere  and a lusty Bacheler
With lokkes crulle  as they were leyd in presse
Of twenty yeer of Age  he was I gesse
Of his stature  he was of euene lengthe
And wonderly delyuere  and of greet strengthe
And he hadde been somtyme in chyuachie
In fflaundres  in Artoys and Pycardie
And born hym weel  as of so litel space
In hope  to stonden in his lady grace
Embrouded was he  as it were a meede
Al ful of fresshe floures  whyte and reede
Syngynge he was  or floytynge al the day
He was as fressh  as in the Monthe of May
Short was his gowne  with sleues longe and wyde
Wel koude he sitte on hors and faire ryde
He koude songes make  and wel endite
Iuste and eek daunce  and weel purtreye and write
So hoote he louede  that by nyghtertale  
He slepte namoore than dooth a nyghtyngale
Curteis he was  lowely  and seruysable


And carf  biforn his fader at the table
A Yeman hadde he  and seruantz namo
At that tyme  for hym liste ride soo
And he was clad  in cote and hood of grene
A sheef of pecok arwes  bright and kene
Vnder his belt he bar ful thriftily
Wel koude he  dresse his takel yemanly
Hise arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe
And in his hand  he baar a myghty bowe
A not heed hadde he  with a broun visage
Of woodecraft  wel koude he al the vsage
Vp on his arm  he baar a gay bracer
And by his syde  a swerd  and a bokeler
And on that oother syde  a gay daggere
Harneised wel  and sharpe as point of spere
A Cristophere on his brest of siluer sheene
An horn he bar  the bawdryk was of grene
A fforster was he  soothly as I gesse
Ther was also  a Nonne a PRIORESSE
That of hir smylyng  was ful symple and coy
Hire gretteste ooth  was but by seint Loy
And she was cleped  madame Eglentyne
fful weel she soong the seruice dyuyne
Entuned in hir nose  ful semeely
And frenssh  she spak  ful faire and fetisly
After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe
ffor frenssh of Parys  was to hire vnknowe
At mete  wel ytaught was she with alle
She leet no morsel  from hir lippes falle
Ne wette hir fyngres  in hir sauce depe
Wel koude she carie a morsel  and wel kepe
That no drope  ne fille vp on hire brist
In curteisie was set ful muchel hir list
Hire ouer lippe  wyped she so clene
That in hir coppe  ther was no ferthyng sene
Of grece  whan she dronken hadde hir draughte


fful semely  after hir mete she raughte
And sikerly  she was of greet desport
And ful plesaunt  and amyable of port
And peyned hire to countrefete cheere
Of Court and to been estatlich of manere
And to ben holden digne of reuerence
But for to speken of hire conscience
She was so charitable and so pitous
She wolde wepe  if that she saugh a Mous
Kaught in a trappe  if it were deed or bledde  
Of smale houndes  hadde she þat she fedde
With rosted flessh  or Milk  and wastel breed
But soore wepte she  if any of hem were deed
Or if men smoot it  with a yerde smerte
And al was conscience and tendre herte
fful semyly  hir wympul pynched was
Hire nose tretys  hir eyen greye as glas
Hir mouth ful smal  and ther to softe and reed
But sikerly  she hadde a fair forheed
It was almoost  a spanne brood I trowe
ffor hardily  she was nat vndergrowe
fful fetys was hir cloke  as I was war
Of smal coral  aboute hire Arm she bar
A peire of bedes  gauded al with grene
And ther on  heng a brooch of gold ful sheene
On which  ther was first write a crowned A
And after  Amor vincit omnia
Another Nonne  with hire hadde she
That was hire Chapeleyne and preestes thre
A Monk ther was  a fair for the maistrie
An outridere  that louede venerie
A manly man  to been an Abbot able
fful many a deyntee hors  hadde he in stable
And whan he rood  men myghte his brydel heere
Gynglen  in a whistlynge wynd als cleere
And cek as loude  as dooth þe Chapel belle


Ther as this lord  was kepere of the Celle
The reule of seint Maure  or of seint Beneit 
By cause that it was old  and som del streit 
This ilke Monk  leet olde thynges pace
And heeld  after the newe world the space
He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen
That seith  that hunters beth nat hooly men
Ne that a Monk  whan he is recchelees
Is likned  til a fissh  þat is waterlees
This is to seyn  a Monk out of his Cloystre
But thilke text  heeld he nat worth an Oystre
And I seyde  his opinion was good
What sholde he studie  and make hym seluen wood
Vpon a book  in Cloystre alwey to poure
Or swynken with his handes and laboure
As Austyn bit  how shal the world be serued
Lat Austyn  haue his owene swynk  to him reserued
Therfore  he was a prikasour aright
Grehoundes he hadde  as swift as fowel in flight
Of prikyng and of huntyng for the hare
Was al his lust  for no cost wolde he spare
I seigh his sleues  ypurfiled at the hond  
With grys  and that the fyneste of a lond
And for to festne his hood vnder his chyn
He hadde of gold  ywroght  a ful curious pyn
A loue knotte  in the gretter ende ther was
His heed was balled  þat shoon as any glas
And eek his face  as it hadde been enoynt
He was a lord ful fat  and in good poynt
Hise eyen stepe  and rollynge in his heed
That stemed  as a forneys of a leed
His bootes souple  his hors in greet estaat
Now certeinly  he was a fair prelaat
He was nat pale  as a forpyned goost
A fat swan loued he best of any roost
His palfrey  was as broun as is a berye


Affrere ther was  a wantowne and a merye
A lymytour  a ful solempne man
In alle the ordres foure  is noon þat kan
So muchel of daliaunce  and fair langage
He hadde maad  ful many a mariage
Of yonge wommen  at his owene cost
Vn to his ordre  he was a noble post
And wel biloued  and famulier was he
With frankeleyns  ouer al in his contree
And  with worthy wommen of the toun
ffor he hadde power of confessioun
As seyde hym self  moore than a Curat
ffor of his ordre  he was licenciat
fful swetely  herde he confession
And plesaunt was his absolucion
He was an esy man  to yeue penaunce
Ther as he wiste  to haue a good pitaunce
ffor vnto a poure ordre  for to yiue
Is signe  þat a man is wel yshryue
ffor if he yaf  he dorste make avaunt
He wiste  that a man was repentaunt
ffor many a man  so harde is of his herte
He may nat wepe  al thogh hym soore smerte
Therfore in stede of wepynge and preyeres
Men moote yeue siluer  to the poure freres
His typet was ay farsed ful of knyues
And pynnes  for to yeuen yonge wyues
And certeinly  he hadde a murye note
Wel koude he synge  and pleyen on a rote
Of yeddynges  he baar outrely the pris
His nekke  whit was  as the flour delys
Ther to  he strong was as a Champion
He knew the Tauernes wel in al the toun
And euerich Hostiler  and Tappestere  
Bet than a lazar  or a beggestere
ffor vn to swich a worthy man as he


Acorded nat  as by his facultee
To haue with sike lazars Aqueyntance
It is nat honeste  it may nat avance
ffor to deelen  with no swich poraille
But al with riche  and selleres of vitaille
And ouer al  ther as profit sholde arise
Curteis he was  and lowely of seruyse
Ther nas no man  nowher so vertuous
He was  the beste beggere in his hous
    
sfor thogh a wydwe  hadde noght a sho
So plesaunt  was his In principio
Yet wolde he haue  a ferthyng er he wente
His purchas  was wel bettre than his rente
And rage he koude  as it were right a whelpe
In loue dayes  ther koude he muchel helpe
ffor there he was nat lyk a Cloystrer
With a thredbare cope  as is a poure scoler
But he was lyk  a maister  or a pope
Of double worstede  was his semycope
That rounded as a belle  out of the presse
Somwhat he lipsed  for his wantownesse
To make his englissh  sweete vp on his tonge
And in his harpyng whan þat he hadde songe
Hise eyen twynkled in his heed aryght
As doon the sterres  in the frosty nyght
This worthy lymytour  was cleped Huberd
A Marchant was ther with a forked berd
In Motlee and hye on horse he sat
Vp on his heed a fflaundryssh Beuere hat 
His bootes clasped  faire and fetisly
Hise resons he spak  ful solempnely
Sownynge alway thencrees of his wynnyng
He wolde the see were kept for any thing
Bitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle


Wel koude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle
This worthy man  ful wel his wit bisette
Ther wiste no wight þat he was in dette
So estatly  was he of his gouernaunce
With his bargaynes  and with his cheuyssaunce
ffor sothe  he was a worthy man with alle
But sooth to seyn  I noot how men hym calle
A Clerk ther was  of Oxenford also
That vn to logyk  hadde longe ygo
And leene was his hors as is a rake
And he nas nat right fat I vndertake
But looked holwe  and ther to sobrely  
fful thredbare  was his ouereste courtepy
ffor he hadde geten hym yet no benefice
Ne was so worldly  for to haue office
ffor hym was leuere  haue at his beddes heed
Twenty bookes  clad in blak or reed
Of Aristotle  and his Philosophie
Than robes riche  or fithele  or gay sautrie
But al be  that he was a Philosophre
Yet hadde he  but litel gold in cofre
But al þat he myghte  of his freendes hente
On bookes  and his lernynge he it spente
And bisily  gan for the soules preye
Of hem  þat yaf hym wher with to scoleye
Of studie took he moost cure and moost heede
Noght o word  spak he moore than was neede
And that was seyd  in forme and reuerence
And short and quyk and ful of hy sentence
Sownynge in moral vertu  was his speche
And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche
A Sergeant of the Lawe  war and wys
That often hadde been at the Parvys
Ther was also  ful riche of excellence
Discreet he was  and of greet reuerence
He semed swich  hise wordes weren so wise


Iustice he was  ful often in Assise
By patente  and by pleyn commissioun
ffor his science  and for his heigh renoun
Of fees and robes  hadde he many oon
So greet a purchasour  was nowher noon
Al was fee symple to hym in effect
His purchasyng  myghte nat been infect
Nowher  so bisy a man as he ther nas
And yet he semed  bisier than he was
In termes hadde he caas and doomes alle
That from the tyme  of kyng william were yfalle
Therto  he koude endite and make a thyng
Ther koude no wight  pynchen at his writyng
And euery statut  koude he pleyn by rote
He rood but hoomly  in a medlee cote
Girt with a ceint of silk  with barres smale
Of his array telle I no lenger tale
A ffrankeleyn  was in his compaignye
Whit was his heed  as is a dayesye
Of his complexion  he was sangwyn
Wel loued he by the morwe a sope in wyn
To lyuen in delit was euere his wone
For he was  Epicurus owene sone
That heeld opinion that pleyn delit  
Was verray felicitee parfit
An housholdere  and that a greet was he
Seint Iulian was he in his contree
His breed  his Ale  was alweys after oon
A bettre envyned man  was neuere noon
With oute bake mete  was neuere his hous
Of fissh and flessh  and that so plenteuous
It snewed in his hous  of mete and drynke
Of alle deyntees  that men koude thynke
After the sondry sesons  of the yeer
So chaunged he  his mete and his soper
fful many a fat partrich  hadde he in Muwe


And many a Breem  and many a luce in Stuwe
Wo was his Cook  but if his sauce were
Poynaunt  and sharpe  and redy al his geere
His table dormant in his halle alway
Stood redy couered  al the longe day
At sessions ther was he lord and sire
fful ofte tyme  he was knyght of the shire
An Anlaas  and a gipser al of silk
Heeng at his girdel  whit as morne Milk 
A shirreue hadde he been and Countour
Was nowher  such a worthy Vauasour
AN haberdasshere and a Carpenter
A Webbe  a Dyere  and a Tapycer
And they were clothed alle in o lyueree
Of a solempne  and a greet fraternitee
fful fressh and newe  hir geere apiked was
Hir knyues  were chaped noght with bras
But al with siluer  wroght ful clene and weel
Hire girdles and hir pouches euerydeel
Wel semed ech of hem  a fair burgeys
To sitten in a yeldehalle  on a deys
Euerich  for the wisdom þat he kan
Was shaply  for to been an Alderman
ffor catel hadde they ynogh and rente
And eek hir wyues wolde it wel assente
And elles certeyn  were they to blame
It is ful fair  to been ycleped ma Dame
And goon to vigilies  al bifore
And haue a Mantel roialliche ybore
A Cook they hadde with hem for the nones
To boille the chiknes with the Marybones
And poudre Marchant tart and galyngale
Wel koude he knowe  a draughte of London ale
He koude rooste and sethe  and boille and frye
Maken Mortreux  and wel bake a pye
But greet harm was it  as it thoughte me  

That on his shyne  a mormal hadde he
ffor blankmanger  that made he with the beste
A Shipman was ther  wonynge fer by weste
ffor aught I woot  he was of Dertemouthe
He rood vp on a Rouncy  as he kouthe
In a gowne of faldyng to the knee
A daggere  hangynge on a laas hadde he
Aboute his nekke  vnder his Arm adoun
The hoote somer  hadde maad his hewe al broun
And certeinly  he was a good felawe
fful many a draughte of wyn  had he drawe
ffro Burdeuxward  whil that the Chapman sleepe
Of nyce conscience  took he no keepe
If þat he faught and hadde the hyer hond
By water  he sente hem hoom to euery lond
But of his craft  to rekene wel his tydes
His stremes  and his daungers hym bisides
His herberwe  and his moone  his lodemenage
Ther nas noon swich  from Hulle to Cartage
Hardy he was and wys  to vndertake
With many a tempest  hadde his berd been shake
He knew alle the hauenes  as they were
ffron Gootlond to the Cape of ffynystere
And euery cryke  in Britaigne and in Spayne
His Barge  ycleped was the Maudelayne
With vs ther was a Doctour of Phisik
In al this world  ne was ther noon hym lik
To speke of phisik  and of Surgerye
ffor he was grounded in Astronomye
He kepte his pacient a ful greet deel
In houres  by his magyk natureel
Wel koude he fortunen the Ascendent
Of hise ymages  for his pacient
He knew the cause  of euerich maladye
Were it of hoot or cold  or moyste  or drye
And where they engendred  and of what humour


He was a verray parfit praktisour
The cause yknowe  and of his harm the roote
Anon he yaf  the sike man his boote
fful redy hadde he  hise Apothecaries
To sende him drogges and his letuaries
ffor ech of hem  made oother for to wynne
Hir frendshipe  nas nat newe to bigynne
Wel knew he  the olde Esculapius
And Deyscorides  and eek Risus
Olde ypocras  Haly  and Galyen
Serapion Razis  and Auycen
Auerrois  Damascien  and Constantyn  
Bernard  and Gatesden  and Gilbertyn
Of his diete  mesurable was he
ffor it was  of no superfluitee
But of greet norissyng  and digestible
His studie  was but litel on the Bible
In sangwyn and in pers  he clad was al
Lyned with Taffata  and with Sendal
And yet he was  but esy of dispence
He kepte  that he wan in pestilence
ffor gold in Phisik  is a cordial
Therfore he louede gold in special
A good wif was ther of biside Bathe
But she was som del deef and þat was scathe
Of clooth makyng she hadde swich an haunt
She passed hem of ypres and of Gaunt
In al the parisshe  wif ne was ther noon
That to the offrynge  bifore hire sholde goon
And if ther dide  certeyn so wrooth was she
That she was  out of alle charitee
Hir couerchiefs  ful fyne weren of ground
I dorste swere  they weyeden ten pound
That on a sonday  weren vpon hir heed
Hir hosen weren  of fyn scarlet reed
fful streite yteyd  and shoes ful moyste and newe


Boold was hir face  and fair and reed of hewe
She was a worthy womman al hir lyue
Housbondes at chirche dore  she hadde fyue
Withouten oother compaignye in youthe
But ther of  nedeth nat to speke as nowthe
And thries  hadde she been at Ierusalem
She hadde passed  many a straunge strem
At Rome she hadde been and at Boloigne
In Galice at Seint Iame  and at Coloigne
She koude muchel  of wandrynge by the weye
Gat tothed was she  soothly for to seye
Vp on an Amblere  esily she sat
Ywympled wel  and on hir heed an hat
As brood  as is a bokeler  or a targe
A foot mantel  aboute hir hipes large
And on hire feet a paire of spores sharpe
In felaweshipe  wel koude she laughe and carpe
Of remedies of loue  she knew per chaunce
For she koude of that Art the olde daunce
A good man was ther of Religioun
And was  a poure Person of a toun
But riche he was  of hooly thoght and werk
He was also  a lerned man a clerk
That cristes gospel  trewely wolde preche  
Hise parisshens  deuoutly wolde he teche
Benygne he was  and wonder diligent
And in Aduersitee ful pacient
And swich  he was preued ofte sithes
fful looth were hym  to cursen for hise tithes
But rather wolde he yeuen out of doute
Vn to his poure parisshens aboute
Of his offryng and eek of his substaunce
He koude  in litel thyng haue suffisaunce
Wyd was his parisshe  and houses fer a sonder
But he ne lafte nat for reyn ne thonder
In siknesse nor in meschief  to visite


The ferreste in his parisshe muche and lite
Vp on his feet and in his hand a staf
This noble ensample to his sheepe he yaf
That firste he wroghte  and afterward that he taughte
Out of the gospel  he tho wordes caughte
And this figure  he added eek ther to
That if gold ruste  what shal Iren doo
For if a preest be foul  on whom we truste
No wonder is  a lewed man to ruste
And shame it is  if  a prest take keepe
A shiten shepherde  and a clene sheepe
Wel oghte a preest  ensample for to yeue
By his clennesse  how þat his sheepe sholde lyue
He sette nat his benefice to hyre
And leet his sheepe  encombred in the Myre
And ran to London  vn to seint Poules
To seken hym a chauntrie for soules
Or with a bretherhed  to been withholde
But dwelleth at hoom and kepeth wel his folde
So that the wolf  ne made it nat myscarie
He was a shepherde  and noght a Mercenarie
And though he hooly were  and vertuous
He was nat to synful man despitous
Ne of his speche  daungerous ne digne
But in his techyng discreet and benygne
To drawen folk to heuene by fairnesse
By good ensample  this was his bisynesse
But it were any persone obstinat
What so he were  of heigh or lough estat
Hym wolde he snybben sharply for the nonys
A bettre preest I trowe  þat nowher noon ys
He waiteth  after no pompe and reuerence
Ne maked him a spiced conscience
But cristes loore  and hise Apostles twelue
He taughte  but first he folwed it hym selue
With hym ther was a Plowman was his brother  

That hadde ylad of dong ful many a fother
A trewe swynkere  and a good was he
Lyuynge in pees  and parfit charitee
God loued he best  with al his hoole herte
At alle tymes  thogh he gamed or smerte
And thanne his neighebore  right as hym selue
He wolde thresshe  and ther to dyke and delue
For cristes sake  for euery poure wight
Withouten hire  if it lay in his myght
Hise tithes  payde he ful faire and wel
Bothe of his propre swynk and his catel
In a Tabard he rood  vpon a Mere
Ther was also  a Reue and a Millere
A Somnour  and a Pardoner also
A Maunciple  and my self ther were namo
 The Millere was a stout carl for the nones
Ful byg he was  of brawn  and eek of bones
That proued wel  for ouer al ther he cam
At wrastlynge  he wolde haue alwey the Ram
He was short sholdred  brood  a thikke knarre
Ther nas no dore  þat he ne wolde heue of harre
Or breke it  at a rennyng with his heed
His berd  as any sowe  or fox was reed
And ther to brood  as though it were a spade
Vp on the cope  right of his nose he hade
A werte  and ther on stood a toft of herys
Reed  as the brustles  of a sowes erys
Hise nosethirles  blake were and wyde
A swerd and a bokeler  bar he by his syde
His mouth as greet was  as a greet forneys
He was a Ianglere and a goliardeys
And that was moost  of synne and harlotries
Wel koude he stelen corn  and tollen thries
And yet he hadde  a thombe of gold pardee
A whit cote  and a blew hood wered he
A baggepipe  wel koude he blowe and sowne


And ther with al  he broghte vs out of towne
A gentil Maunciple  was ther of a temple
Of which Achatours  myghte take exemple
ffor to be wise  in byynge of vitaille
ffor wheither that he payde  or took by taille
Algate  he wayted so  in his Achaat
That he was ay biforn  and in good staat
Now is nat that of god a ful fair grace
That swich a lewed mannes wit shal pace
The wisdom  of an heepe of lerned men
Of maistres hadde he  mo than thries ten
That weren of lawe  expert and curious  
Of whiche  þer weren a duszeyne in that hous
Worthy to been stywardes  of rente and lond
Of any lord  that is in Engelond
To maken hym lyue  by his propre good
In honour dettelees  but if he were wood
Or lyue as scarsly  as hym list desire
And able  for to helpen al a shire
In any caas  þat myghte falle or happe
And yet this manciple  sette hir aller cappe
The Reue was  a sclendre colerik man
His berd was shaue  as ny as euer he kan
His heer was by his erys  ful round yshorn
His tope was doked  lyk a preest biforn
fful longe were his legges  and ful lene
ylyk a staf  ther was no calf ysene
Wel koude he kepe a gerner  and a bynne
Ther was noon Auditour  koude of him wynne
Wel wiste he  by the droghte  and by the reyn
The yeldynge  of his seed  and of his greyn
His lordes sheepe  his neet his dayerye
His swyn  his hors  his stoor  and his pultrye
Was hoolly  in this Reues gouernyng 
And by his couenant yaf the rekenyng
Syn that his lord  was twenty yeer of age


Ther koude no man  brynge hym in Arrerage
Ther nas baillif ne hierde  nor oother hyne
That he  knew his sleighte and his couyne
They were adrad of hym  as of the deeth
His wonyng was ful faire vp on an heeth
With grene trees  shadwed was his place
He koude bettre than his lord purchace
fful riche he was astored pryuely
His lord  wel koude he plesen subtilly
To yeue and lene hym  of his owene good
And haue a thank  yet a gowne and hood
In youthe he hadde lerned a good myster
He was a wel good wrighte a Carpenter
This Reue sat vp on a ful good stot
That was al pomely grey  and highte Scot
A long surcote of pers  vp on he hade
And by his syde  he baar a rusty blade
Of Northfolk was this Reue  of which I telle
Biside a toun  men clepen Baldeswelle
Tukked he was  as is a frere aboute
And euere he rood  the hyndreste of oure route
A Somonour was ther with vs in that place
That hadde  a fyr reed Cherubynnes face
ffor sawcefleem he was with eyen narwe  
As hoot he was  and lecherous as a sparwe
With scaled browes blake and piled berd
Of his visage  children were aferd
Ther nas quyk siluer  lytarge ne brymstoon
Boras  Ceruce  ne oille of Tartre noon
Ne oynement that wolde clense and byte
That hym myghte helpen  of the whelkes white
Nor of the knobbes  sittynge on his chekes
Wel loued he garleek  oynons  and eek lekes
And for to drynken strong wyn  reed as blood
Thanne wolde he speke  and crie as he were wood
And whan þat he  wel dronken hadde the wyn


Than wolde he speke no word but latyn
A fewe termes hadde he  two or thre
That he had lerned  out of som decree
No wonder is  he herde it al the day
And eek ye knowen wel  how þat a Iay
Kan clepen watte  as wel as kan the pope
But who so koude in oother thyng hym grope
Thanne hadde he spent al his Philosophie
Ay questio quid iuris  wolde he crie
He was  a gentil harlot and a kynde
A bettre felawe  sholde men noght fynde
He wolde suffre  for a quart of wyn
A good felawe  to haue his concubyn
A twelf monthe  and excuse hym atte fulle
And priuely  a fynch eek koude he pulle
And if he foond owher  a good felawe
He wolde techen him  to have noon Awe
In swich caas  of the Ercedekenes curs
But if a mannes soule  were in his purs
ffor in his purs  he sholde ypunysshed be
Purs  is the Ercedekenes helle seyde he
But wel I woot  he lyed right in dede
Of cursyng oghte ech gilty man  drede
ffor curs wol slee  right as assoillyng sauith
And also  war him of a Significauit
In daunger hadde he  at his owene gise
The yonge girles  of the diocise
And knew hir conseil  and was al hir reed
A gerland  hadde he set vp on his heed
As greet  as it were for an Ale stake
A bokeleer  hadde he maad him of a Cake
With hym ther was  a gentil Pardoner
Of Rounciuale  his freend and his compeer
That streight was comen  fro the court of Rome
fful loude he soong com hider loue to me
This Somonour  bar to hym a stif burdoun  

Was neuere trompe  of half so greet a soun
This Pardoner hadde heer  as yelow as wex
But smothe it heeng as dooth a strike of flex
By ounces  henge hise lokkes þat he hadde
And ther with  he hise shuldres ouerspradde
But thynne it lay  by colpons oon and oon
But hood for Iolitee  wered he noon
For it was trussed  vp in his walet
Hym thoughte  he rood  al of the newe Iet
Discheuelee saue his cappe  he rood al bare
Swiche glarynge eyen hadde he as an hare
A vernycle hadde he sowed  vp on his cappe
His walet  biforn hym  in his lappe
Bret ful of pardon  comen from Rome al hoot
A voys he hadde  as smal as hath a goot
No berd hadde he  ne neuere sholde haue
As smothe it was  as it were late shaue
I trowe  he were a geldyng or a mare
But of his craft fro Berwyk in to Ware
Ne was ther  swich another Pardoner
ffor in his male  he hadde a pilwe beer
Which þat he seyde  was oure lady veyl
He seyde he hadde  a gobet of the seyl
That seint Peter hadde  whan þat he wente
Vp on the see  til Ihesu crist hym hente
He hadde a croys of laton  ful of stones
And in a glas  he hadde pigges bones
But with thise relikes  whan þat he fond
A poure person  dwellynge vp on lond
Vp on a day  he gat hym moore moneye
Than þat the person gat  in Monthes tweye
And thus  with feyned flaterye and Iapes
He made the person and the peple his Apes
But trewely  to tellen atte laste
He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste
Wel koude he rede  a lesson or a storie


But alderbest  he song an Offertorie
ffor wel he wiste  whan þat song was songe
He moste preche  and wel affile his tonge
To wynne siluer  as he ful wel koude
Therefore he song  the murierly and loude
NOw haue I toold you shortly in a clause
The staat tharray  the nombre and eek the cause
Why þat assembled was this compaignye
In Southwerk  at this gentil hostelrye
That highte the Tabard  faste by the belle
But now is tyme  to yow for to telle
How that we baren vs that ilke nyght  
Whan we were  in that hostelrie alyght
And after wol I telle  of our viage
And al the remenaunt of oure pilgrimage
But first I pray yow  of youre curteisye
That ye narette it nat my vileynye
Thogh þat I pleynly speke in this mateere
To telle yow  hir wordes and hir cheere
Ne thogh I speke hir wordes proprely
ffor this ye knowen  al so wel as I
Who so shal telle a tale  after a man
He moote reherce  as ny as euere he kan
Euerich a word  if it be in his charge
Al speke he  neuer so rudeliche or large
Or ellis  he moot telle his tale vntrewe
Or feyne thyng  or fynde wordes newe
He may nat spare  al thogh he were his brother
He moot as wel  seye o word as another
Crist spak hym self  ful brode in hooly writ
And wel ye woot no vileynye is it
Eek Plato seith  who so kan hym rede
The wordes  moote be cosyn to the dede
Also I prey yow  to foryeue it me
Al haue I nat set folk in hir degree
Heere in this tale  as þat they sholde stonde


My wit is short ye may wel vnderstonde
 Greet chiere made oure hoost vs euerichon
And to the soper  sette he vs anon
And serued vs  with vitaille at the beste
Strong was the wyn  and wel to drynke vs leste
A semely man  oure hoost was with alle
ffor to been  a Marchal in an halle
A large man he was  with eyen stepe
A fairer Burgeys  was ther noon in Chepe
Boold of his speche  and wys and well ytaught
And of manhod  hym lakked right naught
Eek therto  he was right a myrie man
And after soper  pleyen he bigan
And spak of myrthe  amonges othere thynges
Whan that we  hadde maad our rekenynges
And seyde thus  now lordynges trewely
Ye been to me  right welcome hertely
ffor by my trouthe  if that I shal nat lye
I saugh nat this yeer  so myrie a compaignye
Atones in this herberwe as is now
ffayn wolde I doon yow myrthe  wiste I how
And of a myrthe  I am right now bythoght
To doon yow ese  and it shal coste noght
 Ye goon to Caunterbury  god yow speede  
The blisful martir  quite yow youre meede
And wel I woot  as ye goon by the weye
Ye shapen yow  to talen and to pleye
ffor trewely  confort ne myrthe is noon
To ride by the weye doumb as the stoon
And therfore  wol I maken yow disport
As I seyde erst and doon yow som confort
And if yow liketh alle  by oon assent
ffor to stonden  at my Iuggement
And for to werken  as I shal yow seye
To morwe  whan ye riden by the weye
Now by my fader soule that is deed


But if ye be myrie  I wol yeue yow myn heed
 Hoold vp youre hond withouten moore speche
Oure conseil  was nat longe for to seche
Vs thoughte  it was noght worth  to make it wys
And graunted hym  wit outen moore auys
And bad him seye his voirdit as hym leste
 Lordynges quod he  now herkneth for the beste
But taak it nought  I prey yow in desdeyn
This is the poynt to speken short and pleyn
That ech of yow  to shorte with oure weye
In this viage  shal telle tales tweye
To Caunterburyward  I mene it so
And homward  he shal tellen othere two
Of auentures  that whilom han bifalle
And which of yow  that bereth hym best of alle
That is to seyn  that telleth in this caas
Tales of best sentence  and moost solaas
Shal haue a soper  at oure aller cost
Heere in this place  sittynge by this post
Whan that we come agayn fro Caunterbury
And for to make yow  the moore mury
I wol my self  goodly with yow ryde
Right at myn owene cost and be youre gyde
And who so wole  my Iuggement withseye
Shal paye  al that we spenden by the weye
And if ye vouche sauf  that it be so
Tel me anon  with outen wordes mo
And I wol erly  shape me therfore
 This thyng was graunted and oure othes swore
With ful glad herte  and preyden hym also
That he would vouche sauf  for to do so
And that he  wolde been oure gouernour
And of our tales  Iuge and Reportour
And sette a soper  at a certeyn pris
And we  wol reuled been at his deuys
 In heigh and lough  and thus by oon assent  

We been acorded  to his Iuggement
And ther vp on  the wyn was fet anon
We dronken  and to reste wente echon
With outen  any lenger taryynge
Amorwe  whan þat day  gan for to sprynge
Vp roos oure hoost and was oure aller cok
And gadrede vs togidre  alle in a flok
And forth we riden  a litel moore than paas
Vn to the wateryng of Seint Thomas
And there oure hoost bigan his hors areste
And seyde lordynges  herkneth if yow leste
 Ye woot youre foreward  and  it yow recorde
If euen song  and morwe song accorde
Lat se now  who shal telle the firste tale
As euere mote I drynke  wyn or ale
Who so be  rebel to my Iuggement
Shal paye  for al þat by the wey is spent
Now draweth cut er þat we ferrer twynne
He  which þat hath the shorteste shal bigynne
Sire knyght quod he  my mayster and my lord
Now draweth cut  for that is myn accord
Cometh neer quod he  my lady Prioresse
And ye sire clerk  lat be your shamefastnesse
Ne studieth noght  ley hond to euery man
Anon to drawen  euery wight bigan
And shortly  for to tellen as it was
Were it by auenture  or sort or cas
The sothe is this  the cut fil to the knyght
Of which  ful blithe and glad was every wyght
And telle he moste his tale  as was reson
By foreward  and by composicion
As ye han herd  what nedeth wordes mo
An whan this goode man  saugh þat it was so
As he  that wys was and obedient
To kepe his foreward  by his free assent
He seyde  syn I shal bigynne the game


What welcome be the cut  a goddes name
Now lat us ryde  and herkneth what I seye
And with that word  we ryden forth oure weye
And he bigan  with right a myrie cheere
His tale anon  and seyde in this manere

WHilom  as olde stories  tellen vs
Ther was a duc þat highte Theseus
Of Atthenes  he was lord and gouernour
And in his tyme swich a Conquerour
That gretter  was ther noon vnder the Sonne
fful many a riche contree hadde he wonne
That with his wysdom  and his chiualrie
He conquered  al the regne of ffemenye
That whilom  was ycleped Scithia
And wedded the queene ypolita
And broghte hire hoom with hym in his contree
With muchel glorie  and greet solempnytee
And eek hir faire suster Emelye
And thus  with victorie and with melodye
Lete I this noble duc  to Atthenes ryde
An al his hoost in Armes hym bisyde
 And certes  if it nere  to long to heere
I wolde yow haue toold  fully the manere
How wonnen was the regne of ffemenye
By Theseus  and by his chiualrye
And of the grete bataille for the nones
Bitwixen Atthenes and Amazones
And how asseged was ypolita
The faire hardy queene of Scithia
And of the feste  þat was at hir weddynge
And of the tempest  at hir hoom comynge
But al that thyng I moot as now forbere
I haue god woot  a large feeld to ere
And wayke been  the Oxen in my Plough
The remenant of the tale  is long ynough
I wol nat letten eek noon of this route


Lat euery felawe  telle his tale aboute
And lat se now  who shal the soper wynne
And ther I lefte  I wol ayeyn bigynne
This duc  of whom I make mencioun
Whan he was come  almoost vn to the toun
In al his wele  and in his mooste pride
He was war  as he caste his eye aside
Where that ther kneled in the weye
A compaignye of ladyes  tweye and tweye
Ech after oother  clad in clothes blake  
But swich a cry  and swich a wo they make
That in this world  nys creature lyuynge
That herde  swich another waymentynge
And of this cry  they nolde neuere stenten
Til they  the reynes of his brydel henten
 What folk been ye  that at myn hom comynge
Perturben so my feste  with criynge
Quod Theseus  haue ye so greet enuye
Of myn honour  þat thus compleyne and crye
Or who hath yow  mysboden or offended
And telleth me  if it may been amended
And why  þat ye been  clothed thus in blak
 The eldeste lady of hem alle spak
Whan she hadde swowned  with a deedly cheere
That it was routhe  for to seen and heere
And seyde lord  to whom ffortune hath yeuen
Victorie  and as a Conqueror to lyuen
Nat greueth vs  youre glorie and youre honour
But we  biseken mercy and socour
Haue mercy on oure wo  and oure distresse
Som drope of pitee  thurgh thy gentillesse
Vp on vs wrecched wommen  lat thou falle
ffor certes lord  ther is noon of vs alle
That she ne hath been  a duchesse  or a queene
Now be we caytyues  as it is wel seene
Thanked be ffortune  and hire false wheel


That noon estat assureth to be weel
And certes lord  to abyden youre presence
Heere in the temple  of the goddesse clemence
We han ben waitynge  al this fourtenyght
Now help vs lord  sith it is in thy myght
 I wrecche  which þat wepe and crie thus
Was whilom wyf  to kyng Cappaneus
That starf at Thebes  cursed be that day
And alle we that been in this array
And maken  al this lamentacioun
We losten  alle oure housbondes at that toun
Whil that the seege  ther aboute lay
And yet now the olde Creon weylaway
That lord is now  of Thebes the Citee
ffulfild of Ire  and of Iniquitee
He for despit and for his tirannye
To do the dede bodyes vileynye
Of alle oure lordes  whiche that been slawe
He hath alle the bodyes  on an heepe ydrawe
And wol nat suffren hem  by noon assent
Neither to been yburyed nor ybrent
But maketh houndes  ete hem in despit  
And with that word  with outen moore respit
They fillen gruf  and criden pitously
Haue on vs wrecched wommen som mercy
And lat oure sorwe  synken in thyn herte
 This gentil duc doun from his courser sterte
With herte pitous  whan he herde hem speke
Hym thoughte  þat his herte wolde breke
Whan he saugh hem  so pitous and so maat
That whilom weren  of so greet estaat
And in his Armes  he hem alle vp hente
And hem conforteth  in ful good entente
And swoor his ooth  as he was trewe knyght
He wolde doon  so ferforthly his myght
Vp on the tiraunt Creon  hem to wreke


That all the peple of Grece  sholde speke
How Creon  was of Theseus yserued
As he þat hadde  his deeth ful wel deserued
And right anoon  with outen moore abood
His Baner he desplayeth and forth rood
To Thebesward  and al his hoost biside
No neer Atthenes  wolde he go ne ride
Ne take his ese  fully half a day
But onward on his wey  that nyght he lay
And sente anon  ypolita the queene
And Emelye  hir yonge suster sheene
Vn to the toun of Atthenes to dwelle
And forth he rit ther is namoore to telle
The rede statue of Mars  with spere and targe
So shyneth  in his white baner large
That alle the feeldes  glyteren vp and doun
And by his Baner  born is his penoun
Of gold ful riche  in which ther was ybete
The Mynotaur  which þat he slough in Crete
 Thus rit this duc thus rit this Conquerour
And in his hoost of Chiualrie the flour
Til þat he cam to Thebes and alighte
ffaire in a feeld  ther as he thoughte fighte
But shortly  for to speken of this thyng
With Creon  which þat was of Thebes kyng
He faught  and slough hym manly as a knyght
In pleyn bataille  and putte the folk to flyght
And by assaut he wan the Citee after
And rente adoun  bothe wall and sparre and rafter
And to the ladyes  he restored agayn
The bones  of hir housbondes that weren slayn
To doon obsequies  as was tho the gyse
But it were al to longe  for to deuyse
The grete clamour  and the waymentynge  
That the ladyes made  at the brennynge
Of the bodies  and the grete honour


That Theseus  the noble Conquerour
Dooth to the ladyes  whan they from hym wente
But shortly for to telle  is myn entente
 Whan þat this worthy duc this Theseus
Hath Creon slayn  and wonne Thebes thus
Stille in that feeld  he took al nyght his reste
And dide with al the contree  as hym leste
 To ransake in the taas  of the bodyes dede
Hem for to strepe  of harneys and of wede
The pilours  diden bisynesse and cure
After the bataille and disconfiture
And so bifel  þat in the taas they founde
Thurgh girt with many a greuous blody wounde
Two yonge knyghtes  liggynge by and by
Bothe in oon Armes  wroght ful richely
Of whiche two  Arcita highte that oon
And that oother knyght  highte Palamon
Nat fully quyke  ne fully dede they were
But by here Cote Armures  and by hir gere
The heraudes  knewe hem best in special
As they þat weren  of the blood roial
Of Thebes  and of sustren two yborn
Out of the taas  the pilours han hem torn
And han hem caried  softe vn to the tente
Of Theseus  and ful soone he hem sente
To Atthenes  to dwellen in prison
Perpetuelly  he nolde no raunson
And whan this worthy duc hath thus ydon
He took his hoost and hoom he rood anon
With laurer crowned  as a Conquerour
And ther he lyueth  in ioye and in honour
Terme of  lyue  what nedeth wordes mo
And in a tour  in angwissh and in wo
This Palamon  and his felawe Arcite
ffor eueremoore  ther may no gold hem quite
 This passeth  yeer by yeer  and day by day


Till it fil ones  in a morwe of May
That Emelye  þat fairer was to sene
Than is the lylie  vpon his stalke grene
And fressher than the May  with floures newe
ffor with the Rose colour stroof hire hewe
I noot which was the fyner of hem two
Er it were day  as was hir wone to do
She was arisen  and al redy dight
ffor May wole haue  no slogardrie a nyght
The seson  priketh  euery gentil herte  
And maketh hym  out of his slepe to sterte
And seith arys  and do thyn obseruance
This maked Emelye  haue remembrance
To doon honour to May  and for to ryse
Yclothed was she  fressh for to deuyse
Hir yelow heer  was broyded in a tresse
Bihynde hir bak  a yerde long I gesse
And in the gardyn  at the sonne vp riste
She walketh vp and doun  and as hire liste
She gadereth floures party  white and rede
To make a subtil gerland for hire hede
And as an Aungel  heuenysshly she soong
The grete tour  þat was so thikke and stroong
Which of the Castel  was the chief dongeon
Ther as the knyghtes  weren in prison
Of whiche I tolde yow  and tellen shal
Was euene ioynant to the gardyn wal
Ther as this Emelye  hadde hir pleyynge
Bright was the sonne  and cleer that morwenynge
And this Palamon  this woful prisoner
As was his wone  bi leue of his gayler
Was risen  and romed  in a chambre an heigh
In which  he al the noble Citee seigh
And eek the gardyn  ful of braunches grene
Ther as this fresshe Emelye the sheene
Was in hire walk and romed vp and doun


This sorweful prisoner  this Palamoun
Goth in the chambre  romynge to and fro
And to hym self  compleynynge of his wo
That he was born  ful ofte he seyde allas
And so bifel  by auenture or cas
That thurgh a wyndow  thikke of many a barre
Of Iren  greet and square as any sparre
He cast his eye  vpon Emelya
And ther with al he bleynte and cride A
As though he stongen were vn to the herte
And with that cry  Arcite anon vp sterte
And seyde cosyn myn  what eyleth thee
That art so pale  and deedly on to see
Why cridestow  who hath thee doon offence
ffor goddes love  taak al in pacience
Oure prison  for it may noon oother be
Fortune  hath yeuen vs this Aduersitee
Som wikke aspect  or disposicion
Of Saturne  by sum constellacion
Hath yeuen vs this  al though we hadde it sworn
So stood the heuene  whan þat we were born
We moste endure  this is the short and playn  
 This Palamon answerde  and seyde agayn
Cosyn for sothe  of this opinion
Thow hast a veyn ymaginacion
This prison caused me nat for to crye
But I was hurt right now thurgh out myn eye
In to myn herte  that wol my bane be
The fairnesse  of that lady þat I see
Yond in the gardyn  romen to and fro
Is cause  of al my criyng and my wo
I noot wher she be  womman or goddesse
But Venus is it  soothly as I gesse
And ther with al  on knees doun he fil
And seyde Venus  if it be thy wil
Yow in this gardyn  thus to transfigure


Bifore me  sorweful wrecche creature
Out of this prison  helpe þat we may scapen
And if so be  my destynee be shapen
By eterne word  to dyen in prison
Of oure lynage  haue som compassion
That is so lowe ybroght by tirannye
And with that word  Arcite gan espye
Wher as this lady  romed to and fro
And with that sighte  hir beautee hurte hym so
That if that Palamon   wounded sore
Arcite is hurt as moche as he  or moore
And with a sigh  he seyde pitously
The fresshe beautee  sleeth me sodeynly
Of hire  that rometh  in the yonder place
And but I haue  hir mercy and hir grace
That I may seen hire  atte leeste weye
I nam but deed  ther is namoore to seye
 This Palamon  whan he tho wordes herde
Dispitously  he looked and answerde
Wheither seistow this  in ernest or in pley
 Nay quod Arcite  in ernest by my fey
God helpe me so  me list ful yuele pleye
 This Palamon  gan knytte his browes tweye
It nere quod he to thee  no greet honour
ffor to be fals  ne for to be traitour
To me  þat am thy cosyn and thy brother
Ysworn ful depe  and ech of vs til oother
That neuere for to dyen in the peyne
Til þat deeth  departe shal vs tweyne
Neither of vs  in loue to hyndre oother
Ne in noon oother cas  my leeue brother
But þat thou sholdest trewely forthren me
In euery cas  as I shal forthren thee
This was thyn ooth  and myn also certeyn  
I woot right wel  thou darst it nat withseyn
Thus artow of my conseil out of doute


And now  thow woldest falsly been aboute
To loue my lady  whom I loue and serue
And euere shal  til þat myn herte sterue
Nay certes false Arcite  thow shalt nat so
I loued hire first  and tolde thee my wo
As to my conseil  and to my brother sworn
To forthre me  as I haue toold biforn
ffor which  thou art ybounden as a knyght
To helpen me  if it lay in thy myght
Or elles artow fals  I dar wel seyn
 This Arcite  ful proudly spak ageyn
Thow shalt quod he  be rather fals than I
And thou art fals  I telle thee outrely
ffor paramour I loued hire first er thow
What wiltow seyn  thou wistest nat yet now
Wheither she be  a womman or goddesse
Thyn is  affeccion of hoolynesse
And myn is loue  as to a creature
ffor which  I tolde thee myn auenture
As to my cosyn  and my brother sworn
I pose  that thow louedest hire biforn
Wostow nat wel  the olde clerkes sawe
That  who shal yeue a louere any lawe
Loue is a gretter lawe  by my pan
Than may be yeue  of any erthely man
And therfore  positif lawe and swich decree
Is broken al day for loue in ech degree
A man moot nedes loue  maugree his heed
He may nat flee it thogh he sholde be deed
Al be she mayde  or wydwe  or elles wyf
And eek it is nat likly al thy lyf
To stonden in hir grace  namoore shal I
ffor wel thou woost thy seluen verraily
That thou and I  be dampned to prison
Perpetuelly  vs gayneth no raunson
We stryuen  as dide  the houndes for the boon


They foughte al day  and yet hir part was noon
Ther cam a kyte  whil they weren so wrothe
And baar awey the boon  bitwixe hem bothe
And therfore  at the kynges court my brother
Ech man for hym self  ther is noon oother
Loue if thee list for I loue and ay shal
And soothly  leeue brother this is al
Heere in this prison  moote we endure
And euerich of vs  take his auenture
GReet was the strif  and long  bitwix hem tweye  
If that I hadde  leyser for to seye
But to theffect  it happed on a day
To telle it yow  as shortly as I may
A worthy duc that highte Perotheus
That felawe was  to duc Theseus
Syn thilke day  that they were children lite
Was come to Atthenes  his felawe to visite
And for to pleye  as he was won to do
ffor in this world  he loued no man so
And he loued hym  als tendrely agayn
So wel they louede  as olde bookes sayn
That whan þat oon was deed  soothly to telle
His felawe wente  and soughte hym doun in helle
But of that storie  list me nat to write
Duc Perotheus  loued wel Arcite
And hadde hym knowe at Thebes yeer by yere
And finally  at requeste and preyere
Of Perotheus  with outen any raunson
Duc Theseus  hym leet out of prison
ffrely to goon  wher þat hym liste ouer al
In swich a gyse  as I you tellen shal
 This was the forward  pleynly for tendite
Bitwixen Theseus  and hym Arcite
That if so were  þat Arcite were yfounde
Euere in his lif  by day  or nyght or stounde
In any contree  of this Theseus


And he were caught it was acorded thus
That with a swerd  he sholde lese his heed
Ther nas  noon oother remedie ne reed
But taketh his leue  and homward he him spedde
Lat hym be war  his nekke lith to wedde
 How greet a sorwe  suffreth now Arcite
The deeth he feeleth  thurgh his herte smyte
He wepeth  wayleth  crieth pitously
To sleen hym self  he waiteth priuely
He seyde allas  that day þat he was born
Now is my prison  worse than biforn
Now is me shape  eternally to dwelle
Nat in my purgatorie  but in helle
Allas  þat euere knew I Perotheus
ffor elles  hadde I dwelled with Theseus
Yfetered in his prison eueremo
Thanne hadde I been in blisse and nat in wo
Oonly  the sighte of hire  whom þat I serue
Though þat I neuere  hir grace may deserue
Wolde han suffised  right ynough for me
O deere cosyn  Palamon quod he
Thyn is the victorie  of this auenture  
fful blisfully in prison maistow dure
In prison certes nay  but in Paradys
Wel hath ffortune  yturned thee the dys
That hast the sighte of hire  and I thabsence
ffor possible is  syn thou hast hire presence
And art a knyght a worthy and an able
That som cas  syn ffortune is chaungeable
Thow maist to thy desir  som tyme atteyne
But I  þat am exiled and bareyne
Of alle grace  and in so greet dispeir
That ther nys erthe  water  fir  ne eir
Ne creature  þat of hem maked is
That may me heele  or doon confort in this
Wel oughte I sterue  in wanhope and distresse


ffarwel  my lif  my lust and my gladnesse
 Allas  why pleynen folk so in commune
Of puruieaunce of god  or of ffortune
That yeueth hem ful ofte  in many a gyse
Wel bettre  than they kan hem self deuyse
Som man desireth  for to han richesse
That cause is of his moerdre  or greet siknesse
And som man wolde  out of his prison fayn
That in his hous  is of his meynee slayn
Infinite harmes  been in this mateere
We witen nat what  we preyen heere
We faren  as he that dronke is as a Mous
A dronke man woot wel  þat he hath an hous
But he noot which the righte wey is thider
And to a dronke man  the wey is slider
And certes  in this world so faren we
We seken faste  after felicitee
But we goon wrong ful often trewely
Thus may we seyn alle  and namely I
That wende  and hadde a greet opinion
That if I myghte  escapen from prison
Thanne hadde I been in ioye  and perfit heele
That now  I am exiled fro my wele
Syn þat I may nat seen you Emelye
I nam but deed  ther nys no remedye
 Vp on that oother syde  Palamon
Whan þat he wiste  Arcite was agon
Swich sorwe he maketh  þat the grete tour
Resouned  of his youlyng and clamour
The pure fettres  on his shynes grete
Weren  of his bittre salte teeres wete
Allas quod he  Arcita cosyn myn
Of al oure strif  god woot the fruyt is thyn
Thow walkest now in Thebes at thy large  
And of my wo  thow yeuest litel charge
Thou mayst  syn thou hast wysdom and manhede


Assemblen  alle the folk  of oure kynrede
And make a werre  so sharpe on this Citee
That by som auenture  or som tretee
Thow mayst haue hire to lady and to wyf
ffor whom  þat I moste nedes lese my lyf
ffor  as by wey of possibilitee
Sith thou art at thy large  of prison free
And art a lord  greet is thyn auauntage
Moore than is myn  þat sterue here in a cage
ffor I moot wepe  and wayle whil I lyue
With al the wo  þat prison may me yeue
And eek with peyne  þat loue me yeueth also
That doubleth  al my torment  and my wo
Ther with  the fyr of Ialousie vp sterte
With Inne his brest and hente him by the herte
So woodly  that he lyk was to biholde
The Boxtree  or the Asshen dede and colde
 Thanne seyde he  o crueel gooddes þat gouerne
This world  with byndyng of youre word eterne
And writen in the table of Atthamaunt
Youre parlement and youre eterne graunt
What is mankynde  moore vn to you holde
Than is the sheepe  þat rouketh in the folde
ffor slayn is man  right as another beest
And dwelleth eek  in prison and arreest
And hath siknesse  and greet aduersitee
And ofte tymes  giltlees pardee
 What gouernance  is in this prescience
That giltlees  tormenteth Innocence
And yet encresseth this  al my penaunce
That man is bounden  to his observaunce
ffor goddes sake  to letten of his wille
Ther as a beest  may al his lust fulfille
And whan a beest is deed  he hath no peyne
But after his deeth  man moot wepe and pleyne
Though in this world  he haue care and wo


With outen doute  it may stonden so
The answere of this  lete I to dyuynys
But well I woot þat in this world greet pyne ys
Allas  I se a serpent or a theef 
That many a trewe man  hath doon mescheef
Goon at his large  and where hym list may turne
But I moot been in prison  thurgh Saturne
And eek thurgh Juno  Ialous and eek wood
That hath destroyed  wel ny al the blood
Of Thebes  with hise waste walles wyde  
And venus  sleeth me on that oother syde
ffor Ialousie  and fere of hym Arcite
 Now wol I stynte of Palamon a lite
And lete hym  in his prison stille dwelle
And of Arcita  forth I wol yow telle
 The sonne passeth  and the nyghtes longe
Encressen double wise  the peynes stronge
Bothe  of the louere  and the prisoner
I noot which hath the wofuller mester
ffor shortly for to seyn  this Palamon
Perpetuelly  is dampned to prison
In cheynes and in fettres  to been deed
And Arcite  is exiled vpon his heed
ffor euere mo  as out of that contree
Ne neuere mo  he shal his lady see
NOw loueres  axe I now this question
Who hath the worse  Arcite  or Palamon
That oon may seen his lady  day by day
But in prison  he moot dwelle alway
That oother  wher hym list may ride or go
But seen his lady  shal he neuere mo
Now demeth as yow list ye that kan
ffor I wol telle forth  as I bigan
Whan that Arcite  to Thebes comen was
fful ofte a day  he swelte and seyde allas
ffor seen his lady  shal he neuere mo
And shortly  to concluden al his wo
So muche sorwe  hadde neuere creature
That is  or shal  whil þat the world may dure
His slepe  his mete  his drynke  is hym biraft
That lene he wexeth  and drye as is a shaft
Hise eyen holwe  and grisly to biholde
His hewe falow  and pale as Asshen colde
And solitarie he was  and euere allone
And waillynge al the nyght makynge his mone
And if he herde  song or Instrument
Thanne wolde he wepe  he myghte nat be stent
So feble eek were hise spiritz and so lowe
And chaunged so  that no man koude knowe
His speche nor his voys  though men it herde
And in his geere  for al the world he ferde
Nat oonly  lik the loueris maladye  
Of Hereos  but rather lyk Manye
Engendred  of humour malencolik
Biforn his owene Celle fantastik
And shortly  turned was al vp so doun
Bothe habit  and eek disposicioun
Of hym this woful louere daun Arcite
 What sholde I  al day of his wo endite
Whan he endured hadde  a yeer or two
This crueel torment and this peyne and woo
At Thebes in his contree  as I seyde
Vp on a nyght  in sleepe as he hym leyde
Hym thoughte  how that the wynged god Mercurie
Biforn hym stood  and bad hym to be murie
His slepy yerde  in hond he bar vprighte
An hat he werede  vp hise heris brighte


Arrayed was this god  as I took keepe
As he was  whan þat Argus took his sleepe
And seyde hym thus  to Atthenes shaltou wende
Ther is thee shapen  of thy wo an ende
And with that word  Arcite wook and sterte
Now trewely  hou soore þat me smerte
Quod he  to Atthenes  right now wol I fare
Ne for the drede of deeth  shal I nat spare
To se my lady  that I loue and serue
In hire presence  I recche nat to sterue
 And with that word  he caughte a greet Mirour
And saugh  þat chaunged was al his colour
And saugh his visage  al in another kynde
And right anon  it ran hym in his mynde
That sith his face  was so disfigured
Of maladye  the which he hadde endured
He myghte wel  if þat he bar hym lowe
Lyue in Atthenes  eueremoore vnknowe
And seen his lady  wel ny day by day
And right anon  he chaunged his array
And cladde hym  as a poure laborer
And al allone  saue oonly a Squier
That knew his priuetee  and al his cas
Which was disgised  pourely as he was
To Atthenes  is he goon the nexte way
And to the court he wente vp on a day
And at the gate  he profreth his seruyse
To drugge and drawe  what so men wol deuyse
And shortly  of this matere for to seyn
He fil in office  with a Chamberleyn
The which þat dwellynge was with Emelye
ffor he was wys  and koude soone espye
Of euery seruant which that serueth here  
Wel koude he  hewen wode  and water bere
ffor he was yong  and myghty for the nones
And ther to  he was long  and big of bones


To doon  that any wight  kan hym deuyse
A yeer or two  he was in this seruyse
Page of the chambre  of Emelye the brighte
And Philostrate  he seyde þat he highte
But half  so wel  biloued a man as he
Ne was ther neuere in Court of his degree
He was so gentil of his condicioun
That thurghout al the Court was his renoun
They seyden  that it were a charitee
That Theseus  wolde enhauncen his degree
And putten hym  in worshipful seruyse
Ther as he myghte  his vertu excercise
And thus  with Inne a while  his name is spronge
Bothe of hise dedes  and his goode tonge
That Theseus  hath taken hym so neer
That of his chambre  he made hym a Squier
And gaf him gold  to mayntene his degree
And eek men broghte hym  out of his contree
ffrom yeer to yeer  ful pryuely his rente
But honestly  and slyly he it spente
That no man wondred  how þat he it hadde
And thre yeer in this wise  his lif he ladde
And bar hym so  in pees  and eek in werre
Ther was no man  þat Theseus hath derre
And in this blisse  lete I now Arcite
And speke I wole  of Palamon a lite
IN derknesse and horrible  and strong prison
Thise seuen yeer  hath seten Palamon
fforpyned  what for wo  and for distresse
Who feeleth  double soor heuynesse
But Palamon  that loue destreyneth so
That wood out of his wit he goth for wo
And eek ther to  he is a prisoner
Perpetuelly  noght oonly  for a yer
 Who koude ryme in englyssh proprely
His martirdom  for sothe it am nat I


Therfore I passe  as lightly as I may
 It fel  that in the seuenthe yer in May
The thridde nyght as olde bookes seyn
That al this storie  tellen moore pleyn
Were it by auenture or  destynee
As whan a thyng is shapen  it shal be
That soone after the mydnyght Palamon
By helpyng of a freend  brak his prison
 And fleeth the Citee  faste as he may go  
ffor he hade yeue  his gayler drynke so
Of a Clarree maad  of a certeyn wyn
Of Nercotikes  and Opie of Thebes fyn
That al that nyght thogh þat men wolde him shake
The gayler sleepe  he myghte nat awake
 And thus he fleeth  as faste as euere he may
The nyght was short and faste by the day
That nedes cost he moot hym seluen hyde
And til a groue  faste ther bisyde
With dredeful foot thanne stalketh Palamon
ffor shortly  this was his opinion ·
That in that groue  he wolde hym hyde al day
And in the nyght  thanne wolde he take his way
To Thebes ward  his freendes for to preye
On Theseus  to helpe him to werreye
And shortly  outher he wolde lese his lif
Or wynnen Emelye  vn to his wyf
This is theffect and his entente pleyn
 Now wol I turne  to Arcite ageyn
That litel wiste  how ny þat was his care
Til þat ffortune  had broght him in the snare
The bisy larke  messager of day
Salueth in hir song  the morwe gray
And firy Phebus  riseth vp so brighte
That al the Orient laugheth of the lighte
And with hise stremes  dryeth in the greues
The siluer dropes  hangynge on the leues


And Arcita  that is in the court Roial
With Theseus  his Squier principal
Is risen  and looketh on the myrie day
And for to doon  his obseruaunce to May
Remembrynge  on the poynt of his desir
He on a Courser  startlynge as the fir
Is riden in to the feeldes  hym to pleye
Out of the Court were it a myle or tweye
And to the groue  of which þat I yow tolde
By auenture  his wey  he gan to holde
To maken hym  a gerland  of the greues
Were it of wodebynde  or hawethorn leues
And loude he song ayeyn the sonne shene
May  with alle thy floures and thy grene
Wel come be thou  faire fresshe May
In hope  þat I som grene gete may
And from his courser  with a lusty herte
In to a groue  ful hastily he sterte
And in a path  he rometh vp and doun
Ther as by auenture  this Palamon
Was in a bussh  that no man myghte hym se  
ffor soore aferd of his deeth  thanne was he
No thyng ne knew he  that it was Arcite
God woot he wolde haue trowed it ful lite
But sooth is seyd  go sithen many yeres
That feeld hath eyen  and the wode hath eres
It is ful fair  a man to bere hym euene
ffor al day  meeteth men at vnset steuene
fful litel woot Arcite of his felawe
That was so ny  to herknen al his sawe
ffor in the bussh  he sitteth now ful stille
 Whan þat Arcite  hadde romed al his fille
And songen al the roundel lustily
In to a studie  he fil al sodeynly
As doon thise loueres  in hir queynte geres
Now in the crope  now doun in the breres


Now vp  now doun  as boket in a welle
Right as the friday  soothly for to telle
Now it shyneth  now it reyneth faste
Right so  kan geery Venus ouer caste
The hertes of hir folk  right as hir day
Is gereful  right so chaungeth she array
Selde is the friday  al the wowke ylike
 Whan þat Arcite had songe  he gan to sike
And sette hym doun  with outen any moore
Allas quod he  that day þat I was bore
How longe Iuno  thurgh thy crueltee
Woltow werreyen Thebes the Citee
Allas  ybroght is to confusion
The blood roial  of Cadme and Amphion
Of Cadmus  which þat was the firste man
That Thebes bulte  or first the toun bigan
And of the Citee  first was crouned kyng
Of his lynage am I  and his of spryng 
By verray ligne  as of the stok roial
And now I am  so caytyf  and so thral
That he  that is my mortal enemy
I serue hym  as his squier pourely
And yet  dooth Iuno me  wel moore shame
ffor I dar noght biknowe myn owene name
But ther as I  was wont to highte Arcite
Now highte I Philostrate  noght worth a myte
Allas thou felle Mars  allas Iuno
Thus hath youre Ire  oure kynrede al fordo
Saue oonly me  and wrecched Palamon
That Theseus  martireth in prison
And ouer al this  to sleen me outrely
Loue hath  his firy dart so brennyngly
Ystiked  thurgh my trewe careful herte  
That shapen was my deeth  erst than my sherte
Ye sleen me  with youre eyen Emelye
Ye been the cause  wherfore þat I dye


Of al the remenant of myn oother care
Ne sette I nat the montance of a tare
So þat I koude  doon aught to youre plesaunce
And with that word  he fil doun in a traunce
A longe tyme  and after he vp sterte
 This Palamon  þat thoughte þat thurgh his herte
He felte a coold swerd  sodeynliche glyde
ffor Ire he quook  no lenger wolde he byde
And whan þat he  had herd Arcites tale
As he were wood  with face  deed and pale
He stirte hym vp  out of the buskes thikke
And seide Arcite  false traytour wikke
Now artow hent that louest my lady so
ffor whom þat I haue  al this peyne and wo
And art my blood  and to my conseil sworn
As I ful ofte  haue seyd thee heer biforn
And hast byiaped heere  duc Theseus
And falsly  chaunged hast  thy name thus
I wol be deed  or elles thou shalt dye
Thou shalt nat  loue my lady Emelye
But I wol loue hire oonly  and namo
ffor I am Palamon  thy mortal foo
And though þat I no wepene haue in this place
But out of prison  am astert by grace
I drede noght  þat outher thow shalt dye
Or thow ne shalt nat louen Emelye
Chees which thou wolt or thou shalt nat asterte
 This Arcite  with ful despitous herte
Whan he hym knew  and hadde his tale herd
As fiers as leon  pulled out his swerd
And seyde thus  by god þat sit aboue
Nere it  þat thou art sik and wood for loue
And eek þat thow no wepne hast in this place
Thou sholdest neuere  out of this groue pace
That thou ne sholdest dyen of myn hond
ffor I defye  the seurete and the bond


Which that thou seist þat I haue maad to thee
What verray fool  thynk wel  þat loue is fre
And I wol loue hire  mawgree al thy myght
But for as muche  thou art a worthy knyght
And wilnest to darreyne hire by bataille
Haue heer my trouthe  tomorwe I wol nat faile
With oute wityng of any oother wight
That heere  I wol be founden as a knyght
And bryngen harneys  right ynough for thee  
And chese the beste  and leue the worste for me
And mete and drynke  this nyght wol I brynge
Ynough for thee  and clothes for thy beddynge
And if so be  that thou my lady wynne
And sle me in this wode  ther I am Inne
Thow mayst wel haue thy lady  as for me
 This Palamon answerde  I graunte it thee
And thus they been departed  til amorwe
Whan ech of hem  had leyd his feith to borwe
O Cupide  out of alle charitee
O regne  þat wolt no felawe haue with thee
fful sooth is seyd  þat loue ne lordshipe
Wol noght hir thankes  haue no felaweshipe
Wel fynden that Arcite and Palamon
Arcite is riden anon  vn to the toun
And on the morwe  er it were dayes light
fful priuely  two harneys hath he dight
Bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyne
The bataille in the feeld  bitwix hem tweyne
And on his hors  allone as he was born
He carieth  al the harneys  hym biforn
And in the groue  at tyme and place yset
This Arcite  and this Palamon ben met
To chaungen  gan the colour in hir face
Right as the hunters  in the regne of Trace
That stondeth at the gappe with a spere
Whan hunted is  the leon and the bere


And hereth hym  come russhyng in the greues
And breketh  bothe bowes  and the leues
And thynketh  heere cometh my mortal enemy
With oute faile  he moot be deed  or I
ffor outher  I moot sleen hym at the gappe
Or he moot sleen me  if þat me myshappe
So ferden they  in chaungyng of hir hewe
As fer  as euerich of hem oother knewe
 Ther nas no good day ne no saluyng
But streight with outen word  or rehersyng
Euerich of hem  heelpe for to armen oother
As freenly  as he were his owene brother
And after that with sharpe speres stronge
They foynen ech at oother wonder longe
Thou myghtest wene  that this Palamon
In his fightyng were  a wood leon
And as a crueel Tigre was Arcite
As wilde bores  gonne they to smyte
That frothen whit as foom  for Ire wood
Vp to the Anclee  foghte they in hir blood
 And in this wise  I lete hem fightyng dwelle  
And forth I wole  of Theseus yow telle
The destinee  Ministre general
That executeth  in the world ouer al
The purueiaunce  that god hath seyn biforn
So strong it is  þat though the world had sworn
The contrarie of a thyng by ye or nay
Yet somtyme  it shal fallen on a day
That falleth nat eft with Inne a thousand yeere
ffor certeinly  oure appetites heere
Be it of werre  or pees  or hate  or loue
Al is this reuled  by the sighte aboue
 This mene I now  by myghty Theseus
That for to hunten  is so desirus
And namely  at the grete hert in May
That in his bed  ther daweth hym no day


That he nys clad  and redy for to ryde
With hunte and horn  and houndes hym bisyde
ffor in his huntyng  hath he swich delit
That it is  al his ioye and appetit
To been hym self  the grete hertes bane
ffor after Mars  he serueth now dyane
 Cleer was the day  as I haue toold er this
And Theseus  with alle ioye and blis
With his ypolita  the faire queene
And Emelye  clothed al in grene
On huntyng be they riden roially
And to the groue  that stood ful faste by
In which ther was an hert as men hym tolde
Duc Theseus  the streighte wey hath holde
And to the launde  he rideth hym ful right
ffor thider was the hert wont haue his flight
And ouer a brook  and so forth in his weye
This duc  wol han a cours at hym or tweye
With houndes  swiche as hym list comaunde
 And whan this duc was come vn to the launde
Vnder the sonne he looketh  and anon
He was war  of Arcite and Palamon
That foughten breme  as it were bores two
The brighte swerdes  wenten to and fro
So hidously  that with the leeste strook
It semed  as it wolde fille an ook
But what they were  no thyng he ne woot
This duc his courser  with his spores smoot
And at a stert he was bitwix hem two
And pulled out a swerd  and cride hoo
Namoore  vp on peyne of lesynge of youre heed
By myghty Mars  he shal anon be deed
That smyteth any strook  that I may seen  
But telleth me  what mystiers men ye been
That been so hardy  for to fighten heere
With outen Iuge  or oother Officere


As it were  in a lystes roially
 This Palamon  answerde hastily
And seyde  sire  what nedeth wordes mo
We haue  the deeth  disserued bothe two
Two woful wrecches been we  two caytyues
That been encombred  of oure owene lyues
And as thou art a rightful lord and Iuge
Ne yeue vs  neither mercy ne refuge
But sle me first for seinte charitee
But sle my felawe eek as wel as me
Or sle hym first  for though thow knowest it lite
This is thy mortal foo  this is Arcite
That fro thy lond  is banysshed on his heed
ffor which  he hath deserued to be deed
ffor this is he  þat cam vn to thy gate
And seyde  þat he highte Philostrate
Thus hath he iaped thee  ful many a yer
And thou hast maked hym thy chief Squier
And this is he  that loueth Emelye
ffor sith the day is come  þat I shal dye
I make pleynly  my confession
That I am  thilke woful Palamon
That hath  thy prison broken wikkedly
I am thy mortal foo  and it am I
That loueth so hoote  Emelye the brighte
That I wol dye  present in hir sighte
Therfore I axe deeth  and my Iuwise
But sle my felawe  in the same wise
ffor bothe  han we deserued to be slayn
 This worthy duc answerde anon agayn
And seyde  this is a short conclusion
Youre owene mouth  by youre confession
Hath dampned yow  and I wol it recorde
It nedeth noght  to pyne yow with the corde
Ye shal be deed  by myghty Mars the rede
 The queene anon  for verray wommanhede


Gan for to wepe  and so dide Emelye
And alle the ladyes  in the compaignye
Greet pitee was it as it thoughte hem alle
That euere  swich a chaunce sholde falle
ffor gentil men they were  of greet estaat
And no thyng but for loue was this debaat
And saugh hir blody woundes  wyde and soore
And alle crieden  bothe lasse and moore
Haue mercy Lord  vp on vs wommen alle  
And on hir bare knees  adoun they falle
And wolde haue kist his feet ther as he stood
Til at the laste  aslaked was his mood
ffor pitee  renneth soone in gentil herte
And though  he first for Ire quook and sterte
He hath considered  shortly in a clause
The trespas of hem bothe  and eek the cause
And al though þat his Ire  hir gilt accused
Yet in his reson  he hem bothe excused
And thus  he thoghte wel þat euery man
Wol helpe hym self in loue  if that he kan
And eek deliuere hym self  out of prison
And eek his herte hadde compassion
Of wommen  for they wepen euere in oon
And  in his gentil herte  he thoughte anon
And softe vn to hym self  he seyde fy s
Vp on a lord  that wol haue no mercy
But been a leon  bothe in word and dede
To hem  þat been in repentance and drede
As wel  as to a proud despitous man
That wol maynteyne  that he first bigan
That lord  hath litel of discrecion
That in swich cas  kan no diuision
But weyeth  pride and humblesse after oon
And shortly  whan his Ire  is thus agoon
He gan to looken vp  with eyen lighte
And spak thise same wordes  al on highte


 The god of loue  A benedicite
How myghty  and how greet a lord is he
Ayeyns his myght ther gayneth none obstacles
He may be cleped a god  for hise myracles
ffor he kan maken  at his owene gyse
Of euerich herte  as þat hym list diuyse
Lo heere this Arcite  and this Palamon
That quitly weren  out of my prison
And myghte  han lyued in Thebes roially
And witen  I am hir mortal enemy
And þat hir deth  lith in my myght also
And yet hath loue  maugree hir eyen two
Broght hem hyder  bothe for to dye
Now looketh  is nat that an heigh folye
 Who may  been a fole  but if he loue
Bihoold  for goddes sake þat sit aboue
Se how they blede  be they noght wel arrayed
Thus hath hir lord  the god of loue ypayed
Hir wages  and hir fees  for hir seruyse
And yet they wenen  for to been ful wyse
That seruen loue  for aught that may bifalle  
But this is yet the beste game of alle
That she  for whom they han this Iolitee
Kan hem ther fore  as muche thank  as me
She woot namoore  of al this hoote fare
By god  than woot a Cokkow of an hare
But all moot ben assayed  hoot and coold
A man moot ben a fool  or yong or oold
I woot it by my self  ful yore agon
ffor in my tyme  a seruant was I oon
And therfore  syn I knowe of loues peyne
And woot hou soore  it kan a man distreyne
As he  þat hath  ben caught ofte in his laas
I yow foryeue  al hoolly this trespaas
At requeste of the queene  þat kneleth heere
And eek of Emelye  my suster deere


And ye shul bothe  anon vn to me swere
That neuere mo  ye shal my contree dere
Ne make werre vp on me nyght ne day
But been my freendes  in al that ye may
I yow foryeue  this trespas euery deel
And they him sworen  his axyng faire and weel
And hym of lordshipe  and of mercy preyde
And he hem graunteth grace  and thus he seyde
TO speke  of roial lynage and richesse
Though þat she were a queene or a princesse
Ech of you bothe  is worthy doutelees
To wedden whan tyme is doutelees
I speke  as for my suster Emelye
ffor whom ye haue  this strif and Ialousye
Ye woot your self she may nat wedden two
Atones  though ye fighten eueremo
That oon of you  al be hym looth or lief
He moot pipen  in an yuy leef
This is to seyn  she may nat now han bothe
Al be ye neuer so Ialouse  ne so wrothe
And for thy  I yow putte in this degree
That ech of yow  shal haue his destynee
As hym is shape  and herkneth in what wyse
Lo heere your ende  of that I shal deuyse
My wyl is this  for plat conclusion
With outen  any repplicacion
If that you liketh  take it for the beste
That euerich of you  shal goon where hym leste
ffrely  with outen raunson  or daunger
And this day fifty wykes  fer ne ner
Euerich of you  shal brynge an hundred knyghtes
Armed for lystes  vp at alle rightes
 Al redy  to darreyne hire by bataille  
And this bihote I yow  with outen faille
Vp on my trouthe  and as I am a knyght
That wheither of yow bothe þat hath myght


This is to seyn  that wheither he or thow
May with his hundred  as I spak of now
Sleen his contrarie  or out of lystes dryue
Thanne shal I yeue  Emelya to wyue
To whom þat ffortune  yeueth so fair a grace
Tho lystes  shal I maken in this place
And god so wisly  on my soule rewe
As I shal euene Iuge been and trewe
Ye shul noon oother ende  with me maken
That oon of yow  ne shal be deed or taken
And if yow thynketh  this is weel ysayd
Seyeth youre auys  and holdeth you apayd
This is youre ende  and youre conclusion
 Who looketh lightly now  but Palamon
Who spryngeth vp for ioye  but Arcite
Who kouthe telle  or who kouthe endite
The ioye  þat is maked in the place
Whan Theseus  hath doon so fair a grace
But doun on knees  wente every maner wight
And thonken hym  with al hir herte and myght
And namely the Thebans often sithe
And thus with good hope  and with herte blithe
They taken hir leue  and homward gonne they ride
To Thebes  with hise olde walles wyde
I trowe  men wolde deme it necligence
If I foryete  to tellen the dispence
Of Theseus  that gooth so bisily
To maken vp  the lystes roially
That swich a noble Theatre  as it was
I dar wel seyn  in this world ther nas
The circuit  a myle was aboute
Walled of stoon  and dyched al with oute
Round was the shape  in manere of compaas


fful of degrees  the heighte of sixty pas
That whan a man  was set  on o degree
He lette nat his felawe for to see
 Estward  ther stood a gate of Marbul whit
Westward right swich another in the opposit
 And shortly to concluden  swich a place  
Was noon in erthe  as in so litel space
ffor in the lond  ther was no crafty man
That geometrie or Ars Metrik kan
Ne portreitour  ne keruere of ymages
That Theseus  ne yaf  mete and wages
The Theatre  for to maken and deuyse
And for to doon  his ryte and sacrifise
He Estward  hath vp on the gate aboue
In worshipe of Venus goddesse of loue
Doon make an Auter  and an Oratorie
And on the westward  in memorie
Of Mars  he maked hath right swich another
That coste largely  of gold a fother
And Northward  in a Touret  on the wal
Of Alabastre whit and reed coral
An Oratorie  riche for to see
In worshipe of Dyane of Chastitee
Hath Theseus doon wroght in noble wyse
 But yet hadde I foryeten to deuyse
The noble keruyng and the portreitures
The shape  the contenaunce and the figures
That weren  in thise Oratories thre
 ffirst in the temple of Venus  maystow se
Wroght on the wal  ful pitous to biholde
The broken slepes  and the sikes colde
The sacred teeris  and the waymentynge
The firy strokes  and the desirynge
That loues seruauntz  in this lyf enduren
The othes  that her couenantz assuren
Plesaunce and hope  desir foolhardynesse


Beautee and youthe  bauderie richesse
Charmes and force  lesynges flaterye
Despense  bisynesse and Ialousye
That wered of yelewe gooldes a gerland
And a Cokkow  sittynge on hir hand
ffestes  Instrumentz  caroles daunces
Lust and array  and alle the circumstaunces
Of loue  whiche þat I rekned haue  and rekne shal
By ordre  weren peynted on the wal
And mo  than I kan make of mencion
ffor soothly  al the mount of Citheron
Ther Venus  hath hir principal dwellynge
Was shewed on the wal  in portreyynge
With al the gardyn  and the lustynesse
Nat was foryeten  the Porter ydelnesse
Ne Narcisus the faire  of yore agon
And yet the folye  of kyng Salamon
 And eek the grete strengthe of Ercules  
Thenchauntementz of Medea and Circes
Ne of Turnus  with the hardy fiers corage
The riche Cresus  kaytyf  in seruage
Thus may ye seen  þat wysdom ne richesse
Beautee ne sleighte  strengthe hardynesse
Ne may with Venus  holde champartie
ffor as hir list the world than may she gye
Lo alle thise folk so caught were in hir las
Til they for wo  ful ofte seyde allas
Suffiseth heere  ensamples oon or two
And though  I koude rekene a thousand mo
The statue of Venus  glorious for to se
Was naked  fletynge in the large see
And fro the nauele doun  al couered was
With wawes grene  and brighte as any glas
A Citole  in hir right hand  hadde she
And on hir heed  ful semely for to se
A Rose gerland fressh  and wel smellynge


Aboue hir heed  hir dowues flikerynge
Biforn hire  stood hir sone Cupido
Vp on his shuldres  wynges hadde he two
And blynd he was  as it was often seene
A bowe he bar  and Arwes brighte and kene
 Why sholde I noght  as wel eek telle yow al
The portreiture  that was vp on the wal
With Inne the temple  of myghty Mars the rede
Al peynted was the wal  in lengthe and brede
Lyk to the estres  of the grisly place
That highte the grete temple of Mars in Trace
In thilke colde  frosty Region
Ther as Mars  hath his souereyn mansion
 ffirst on the wal  was peynted a forest
In which ther dwelleth  neither man ne best
With knotty knarry  bareyne trees olde
Of stubbes sharpe  and hidouse to biholde
In which ther ran  a rumbel and a swough
As though a storm  sholde bresten euery bough
And dounward from an hille  vnder a bente
Ther stood the temple of Mars Armypotente
Wroght al of burned steel  of which the entree
Was long and streit and gastly for to see
And ther out came a rage  and suche a veze
That it made  al the gate for to rese
The Northren lyght in at the dores shoon
ffor wyndowe  on the wal ne was ther noon
Thurgh which men myghten  any light discerne
The dore was al  of Adamant eterne
Yclenched  ouerthwart and endelong  
With Iren tough  and for to make it strong
Euery pyler the temple to sustene
Was tonne greet of Iren bright and shene
 Ther saugh I first the dirke ymaginyng
Of felonye  and the compassyng
The crueel Ire  reed as any gleede


The pykepurs  and the pale drede
The smylere  with the knyfe vnder the cloke
The shepne  brennynge  with the blake smoke
The treson  of the mordrynge in the bedde
The open werre  with woundes al bibledde
Contek with blody knyf and sharpe manace
Al ful of chirkyng was that sory place
 The sleere of hym self  yet saugh I ther
His herte blood  hath bathed al his heer
The nayl ydryuen  in the shode a nyght
The colde deeth  with mouth gapyng vp right
Amyddes of the temple  sat meschaunce
With disconfort and sory contenaunce
 Yet saugh I woodnesse  laughynge in his rage
Armed compleint out hees  and fiers outrage
The careyne in the busk with throte ycorue
A thousand slayn  and nat oon of qualm ystorue
The tiraunt with the pray by force yraft
The toun destroyed  ther was no thy
 Yet saugh I brent the shippes hoppesteres
The hunte strangled  with the wilde beres
The sowe  freten the child right in the Cradel
The Cook yscalded  for al his longe ladel
 Noght was foryeten  by the Infortune of Marte
The Cartere  ouer ryden with his Carte
Vnder the wheel  ful lowe  he lay adoun
 Ther were also  of Martes diuisioun
The laborer  and the Bocher and the Smyth
That forgeth sharpe swerdes on his Styth
 And al aboue  depeynted in a tour
Saugh I Conquest sittynge in greet honour
With the sharpe swerd  ouer his heed
Hangynge  by a soutil twynes threed
 Depeynted was  the slaughtre of Iulius
Of grete Nero  and of Antonius
Al be þat thilke tyme  they were vnborn


Yet was hir deth  depeynted ther biforn
By manasynge of Mars  right by figure
So was it shewed in that portreiture
As is depeynted  in the Certres aboue
Who shal be slayn  or elles deed for loue
Suffiseth oon ensample in stories olde  
I may nat rekene hem alle though I wolde
The Statue of Mars  vp vn a Carte stood
Armed  and looked grym as he were wood
And ouer his heed  ther shynen two figures
Of sterres  that been cleped in scriptures
That oon Puella  that oother Rubeus
This god of Armes  was arrayed thus
A wolf ther stood  biforn hym at his feet
With eyen rede  and of a man he eet
With soutil pencel  was depeynted this storie
In redoutynge  of Mars and of his glorie
NOw  to the temple  of Dyane the chaste
As shortly as I kan I wol me haste
To telle yow  al the descripsioun
Depeynted been the walles vp and doun
Of huntyng  and of shamefast chastitee
 Ther saugh I  how woful Calistopee
Whan þat Diane  agreued was with here
Was turned  from a womman to a Bere
And after was she maad the loode sterre
Thus was it peynted  I kan sey yow no ferre
Hir sone is eek a sterre as men may see
 Ther saugh I Dane  yturned til a tree
I mene nat the goddesse Diane
But Penneus doughter  which þat highte Dane
 Ther saugh I Attheon  an hert ymaked
ffor vengeance  þat he saugh Diane al naked
I saugh  how þat hise houndes  haue hym caught
And freeten hym  for þat they knewe hym naught
 Yet peynted   a litel forther moor


How Atthalante  hunted the wilde boor
And Meleagree  and many another mo
ffor which Dyane  wroghte hym care and wo
 Ther saugh I  many another wonder storie
The whiche  me list nat drawen to memorie
 This goddesse on an hert ful wel hye seet
With smale houndes  al aboute hir feet
And vndernethe hir feet she hadde a moone
Wexynge it was  and sholde wanye soone
In gaude grene  hir statue clothed was
With bowe in honde  and Arwes in a cas
Hir eyen caste she  ful lowe adoun
Ther Pluto  hath his derke regioun
 A womman trauaillynge  was hire biforn
But for hir child  so longe was vnborn
fful pitously  Lucyna  gan she calle
And seyde helpe  for thou mayst best of alle
Wel koude he peynten lifly  that it wroghte  
With many a floryn  he the hewes boghte
NOw been the lystes maad  and Theseus
That at his grete cost  arrayed thus
The temples  and the Theatre euery deel
Whan it was doon  hym lyked wonder weel
But stynte I wole  of Theseus a lite
And speke of Palamon  and of Arcite
 The day approcheth  of hir retournynge
That euerich  sholde an hundred knyghtes brynge
The bataille to darreyne  as I yow tolde
And til Atthenes  hir couenantz for to holde
Hath euerich of hem  broght an hundred knyghtes
Wel armed for the werre  at alle rightes
And sikerly  ther trowed many a man
That neuere sithen  that the world bigan
As for to speke  of knyghthod of hir hond
As fer  as god hath maked see or lond
Nas of so fewe  so noble a compaignye


ffor euery wight that louede chiualrye
And wolde his thankes  han a passant name
Hath preyd  þat he myghte been of that game
And wel was hym  that ther to chosen was
ffor if ther fille tomorwe swich a caas
Ye knowen wel  þat euery lusty knyght
That loueth paramours  and hath his myght
Were it in Engelond  or elles where
They wolde hir thankes  wilnen to be there
To fighte for a lady  benedicitee
It were a lusty sighte  for to see
 And right so  ferden they with Palamon
With hym  ther wenten knyghtes many on
Som wol ben armed in an haubergeon
And in bristplate  and in a light gypon
And somme woln haue  a paire plates large
And somme woln haue  a Pruce sheeld  or a targe
Somme woln ben armed  on hir legges weel
And haue an Ax  and somme a Mace of steel
Ther is no newe gyse  that it nas old
Armed were they  as I haue yow told
Everych  after his opinion
Ther maistow seen  comynge with Palamon
Lygurge hym self the grete kyng of Trace
Blak was his berd  and manly was his face
The cercles  of hise eyen in his heed
They gloweden  bitwyxen yelow and reed
And lik a grifphon  looked he aboute
With kempe heeris  on hise browes stoute
Hise lymes grete  hise brawnes harde and stronge  
Hise shuldres brode  hise armes rounde and longe
And as the gyse was in his contree
fful hye  vpon a Chaar of gold  stood 
With foure white boles in the trays
In stede of Cote Armure  ouer his harnays
With nayles yelewe  and brighte as any gold


He hadde a Beres skyn  colblak  for old
His longe heer  was kembd  bihynde his bak
As any Rauenes fethere  it shoon for blak
A wrethe of gold arm greet  of huge wighte
Vpon his heed  set ful of stones brighte
Of fyne Rubyes  and of dyamauntz
Aboute his Chaar  ther wenten white Alauntz
Twenty and mo  as grete as any steer
To hunten at the leon or  the deer
And folwed hym  with mosel faste ybounde
Colered of gold  and tourettes fyled rounde
An hundred lordes  hadde he in his route
Armed ful wel  with hertes stierne and stoute
With Arcite  in stories as men fynde
The grete Emetreus  the kyng of Inde
Vp on a steede bay  trapped in steel
Couered in clooth of gold  dyapred weel
Cam ridynge  lyk the god of Armes Mars
His Cote Armure  was of clooth of Tars
Couched with perles  white and rounde and grete
His sadel  was of brend gold newe ybete
A Mantel   vp on his shulder hangynge
Brat ful of Rubyes rede  as fyr sparklynge
His crispe heer  lyk rynges was yronne
And that was yelow  and glytered as the sonne
His nose was heigh  hise eyen bright citryn
Hise lippes rounde  his colour was sangwyn
A fewe frakenes  in his face yspreynd
Bitwixen yelow  and somdel blak ymeynd
And as a leon  he his lookyng caste
Of fyue and twenty yeer  his age I caste
His berd was wel bigonne for to sprynge
His voys  was as a trompe thondrynge
Vp on his heed  he wered of laurer grene
A gerland  fressh  and lusty for to sene
Vp on his hand  he bar for his deduyt


An Egle tame  as any lilye whyt
An hundred lordes  hadde he with hym there
Al armed saue hir heddes  in al hir gere
fful richely  in alle maner thynges
ffor trusteth wel  þat dukes  Erles kynges
Were gadered  in this noble compaignye  
ffor loue  and for encrees of chiualrye
Aboute this kyng ther ran on euery part
fful many a tame leon  and leopard
And in this wise  thise lordes alle and some
Been on the Sonday to the Citee come
Aboute pryme  and in the toun alight
 This Theseus  this duc this worthy knyght
Whan he had broght hem  in to his Citee
And Inned hem  euerich in his degree
He festeth hem  and dooth so greet labour
To esen hem  and doon hem al honour
That yet men weneth  þat no maner wit
Of noon estaat ne koude amenden it
 The Mynstralcye  the seruice  at the feeste
The grete yiftes  to the meeste and leeste
The riche array  of Theseus paleys
Ne who sat first ne last vp on the deys
What ladyes fairest been  or best daunsynge
Or which of hem  kan dauncen best and synge
Ne who moost felyngly speketh of loue
What haukes  sitten on the perche aboue
What houndes  liggen in the floor adoun
Of al this  make I now no mencioun
But al theffect that thynketh me the beste
Now cometh the point and herkneth if yow leste
The sonday nyght er day bigan to sprynge
Whan Palamon  the larke herde synge
Al though it nere nat day  by houres two
Yet song the larke  and Palamon also
With hooly herte  and with an heigh corage


He roos  to wenden on his pilgrymage
Vn to the blisful Citherea benigne
I mene Venus  honurable and digne
And in hir houre  he walketh forth a paas
Vn to the lystes  ther hire temple was
And doun he kneleth  with ful humble cheer
And herte soor  and seyde in this manere
Faireste of faire  o lady myn Venus
Doughter to Ioue  and spouse of Vulcanus
Thow gladere  of the Mount of Citheron
ffor thilke loue  thow haddest to Adoon
Haue pitee  of my bittre teeris smerte
And taak myn humble preyere at thyn herte
Allas  I ne haue  no langage to telle
Theffectes  ne the tormentz of myn helle
Myn herte  may myne harmes nat biwreye
I am so confus  that I kan noght seye
But mercy lady bright that knowest weele  
My thought and seest what harmes þat I feele
Considere al this  and rewe vp on my soore
As wisly  as I shal for eueremoore
Emforth my myght thy trewe seruant be
And holden werre  alwey with chastitee
That make I myn auow  so ye me helpe
I kepe noght of Armes for to yelpe
Ne I ne axe nat tomorwe to haue victorie
Ne renoun in this cas  ne veyne glorie
Of pris of Armes  blowen vp and doun
But I wolde haue  fully possessioun
Of Emelye  and dye in thy seruyse
ffynd thow the manere  hou and in what wyse
I recche nat  but it may bettre be
To haue victorie of hem  or they of me
So that I haue  my lady in myne Armes
ffor though so be  that Mars is god of Armes
Youre vertu is so greet in heuene aboue


That if yow list I shal wel haue my loue
 Thy temple wol I worshipe eueremo
And on thyn Auter  where I ride or go
I wol doon sacrifice  and fires beete
And if ye wol nat so  my lady sweete
Thanne preye I thee  tomorwe  with a spere
That Arcita  me thurgh the herte bere
Thanne rekke I noght  whan I haue lost my lyf
Though that Arcita  wynne hire to his wyf
This is theffect and ende of my preyere
Yif me my loue  thow blisful lady deere
 Whan the orison  was doon of Palamon
His sacrifice he dide  and that anon
fful pitously  with alle circumstance
Al telle I noght as now  his obseruance
But atte laste  the statue of Venus shook 
And made a signe  wher by þat he took
That his preyere  accepted was that day
ffor thogh the signe  shewed a delay
Yet wiste he wel  þat graunted was his boone
And with glad herte  he wente hym hoom ful soone
The thridde houre inequal that Palamon
Bigan  to Venus temple for to gon
Vp roos the sonne  and vp roos Emelye
And to the temple of Dyane gan hye
Hir maydens  þat she thider with hire ladde
fful redily  with hem the fyr they ladde
Thencens  the clothes  and the remenant al
That to the sacrifice  longen shal
The hornes fulle of Meeth  as was the gyse  
Ther lakked noght to doon hir sacrifise
 Smokynge the temple  ful of clothes faire
This Emelye  with herte debonaire
Hir body wessh  with water of a welle
But hou she dide hir ryte  I dar nat telle
But it be  any thing in general


And yet it were a game  to heeren al
To hym þat meneth wel  it were no charge
But it is good  a man been at his large
 Hir brighte heer was kempd vntressed al
A coroune  of a grene ook  cerial
Vp on hir heed was set ful fair and meete
Two fyres  on the auter  gan she beete
And dide hir thynges  as men may biholde
In Stace of Thebes  and thise bookes olde
Whan kyndled was the fyr  with pitous cheere
Vn to Dyane  she spak as ye may heere
Ochaste goddesse  of the wodes grene
To whom bothe heuene and erthe and see is sene
Queene of the regne of Pluto derk  and lowe
Goddesse of maydens  that myn herte hast knowe
fful many a yeer  and woost what I desire
As keepe me  fro thy vengeance and thyn Ire
That Attheon  aboughte cruelly
Chaste goddesse  wel wostow þat I
Desire  to ben a mayden al my lyf
Ne neuere wol I be no loue ne wyf
I am thow woost yet of thy compaignye
A mayde  and loue huntynge and venerye
And for to walken  in the wodes wilde
And noght to ben a wyf  and be with childe
Noght wol I knowe  the compaignye of man
Now helpe me lady  sith ye may and kan
ffor tho thre formes  þat thou hast in thee
And Palamon  that hath swich loue to me
And eek Arcite  that loueth me so soore
This grace I preye thee with oute moore
And sende loue and pees  bitwixe hem two
And fro me  turne awey hir hertes so
That al hire hoote loue  and hir desir
And al hir bisy torment and hir fir
Be queynt or turned  in another place


And if so be  thou wolt do me no grace
And if my destynee  be shapen so
That I shal nedes haue oon of hem two
As sende me hym  þat moost desireth me
Bihoold goddesse  of clene chastitee
The bittre teeris  that on my chekes falle  
Syn thou art mayde  and kepere of vs alle
My maydenhede thou kepe and wel conserue
And whil I lyue  a mayde I wol thee serue
 The fires brenne  vp on the Auter cleere
Whil Emelye  was thus in hir preyere
But sodeynly  she saugh a sighte queynte
ffor right anon  oon of the fyres queynte
And quyked agayn  and after that anon
That oother fyr was queynt and al agon
And as it queynte  it made a whistlynge
As doon thise wete brondes in hir brennynge
And at the brondes ende  out ran anon
As it were  blody dropes many oon
ffor which  so soore agast was Emelye
That she was wel ny mad and gan to crye
ffor she ne wiste  what it signyfied
But oonly for the feere  thus hath she cried
And weepe  that it was pitee for to heere
And ther with al  Dyane gan appeere
With bowe in honde  right as an hunteresse
And seyde doghter  stynt thyn heuynesse
Among the goddes hye  it is affermed
And by eterne word  writen and confermed
Thou shalt ben wedded vn to oon of tho
That han for thee  so muchel care and wo
But vn to which of hem  I may nat telle
ffarwel  for I ne may no lenger dwelle
The fires  whiche that on myn Auter brenne
Shulle thee declare  er that thou go henne
Thyn auenture of loue  as in this cas


And with that word  the Arwes in the Caas
Of the goddesse  clateren faste and rynge
And forth she wente  and made a vanysshynge
ffor which  this Emelye  astoned was
And seyde  what amounteth this Allas
I putte me  in thy proteccion
Dyane  and in thy disposicion
And hoom she goth anon the nexte weye
This is theffect ther is namoore to seye
The nexte houre of Mars folwynge this
Arcite  vn to the temple walked is
Of fierse Mars  to doon his sacrifise
With alle the rytes  of his payen wyse
With pitous herte  and heigh deuocion
Right thus to Mars  he seyde his orison
Ostronge god  that in the regnes colde
Of Trace  honoured art and lord yholde
 And hast in euery regne  and euery lond  
Of armes  al the brydel in thyn hond
And hem fortunest as thee lyst deuyse
Accepte of me  my pitous sacrifise
If so be that my youthe may deserue
And þat my myght be worthy for to serue
Thy godhede  þat I may been oon of thyne
Thanne preye I thee  to rewe vp on my pyne
ffor thilke peyne  and thilke hoote fir
In which  thou whilom brendest for desir
Whan þat thow vsedest the beautee
Of faire yonge  fresshe Venus free
And haddest hire  in armes at thy wille
Al though thee ones  on a tyme mysfille
Whan Vulcanus  hadde caught thee in his las
And foond thee liggynge  by his wyf allas
ffor thilke sorwe  that was in thyn herte
Haue routhe as wel  vp on my peynes smerte
I am yong and vnkonnynge as thow woost


And as I trowe  with loue offended moost
That euere was  any lyues creature
ffor she  þat dooth me  al this wo endure
Ne reccheth neuere  wher I synke or fleete
And wel I woot er she me mercy heete
I moot with strengthe  wynne hire in the place
And wel I woot withouten helpe or grace
Of thee  ne may my strengthe noght auaille
Thanne helpe me lord  tomorwe in my bataille
For thilke fyr  that whilom brente thee
As wel  as thilke fyr  now brenneth me
And do  that I tomorwe haue victorie
Myn be the trauaille  and thyn be the glorie
Thy souereyn temple  wol I moost honouren
Of any place  and alwey moost labouren
In thy plesance  and in thy craftes stronge
And in thy temple  I wol my baner honge
And alle the Armes of my compaignye
And euere mo  vn to that day I dye
Eterne fir  I wol biforn thee fynde
And eek to this auow  I wol me bynde
My beerd  myn heer  that hongeth long adoun
That neuere yet  ne felte offensioun
Of rasour  nor of shere  I wol thee yeue
And ben thy trewe seruant whil I lyue
Now lord haue routhe vp on my sorwes soore
Yif me the victorie  I aske thee namoore
The preyere stynt of Arcita the stronge
The rynges  on the temple dore that honge
And eek the dores  clatereden ful faste  
Of which Arcita  som what hym agaste
The fyres brenden  vp on the Auter brighte
That it gan  al the temple for to lighte
And sweete smel  the ground anon vp yaf
And Arcita  anon his hand vp haf
And moore encens  in to the fyr he caste


With othere rytes mo  and atte last
The Statue of Mars  bigan his hauberk rynge
And with that soun  he herde a murmurynge
fful lowe and dym  and seyde thus  Victorie
ffor which  he yaf to Mars  honour and glorie
And thus with ioye  and hope wel to fare
Arcite anon  vn to his In is fare
As fayn as fowel  is of the brighte sonne
 And right anon  swich strif  ther is bigonne
For thilke grauntyng in the heuene aboue
Bitwixe Venus  the goddesse of love
And Mars  the stierne god Armypotente
That Iuppiter  was bisy it to stente
Til that the pale  Saturnus the colde
That knew so manye  of auentures olde
ffoond  in his olde experience and art
That he ful soone  hath plesed euery part
As sooth is seyd  elde hath greet auantage
In elde  is bothe wysdom and vsage
Men may the olde at renne  and noght at rede
Saturne anon  to stynten strif and drede
Al be it that it is  agayn his kynde
Of al this strif  he gan remedie fynde
 My deere doghter Venus  quod Saturne
My cours  that hath so wyde for to turne
Hath moore power  than woot any man
Myn is the drenchyng in the see so wan
Myn is the prison  in the derke cote
Myn is the stranglyng and hangyng by the throte
The murmure and the cherles rebellyng
The groynynge  and the pryuee empoysonyng
I do vengeance  and pleyn correccion
Whil I dwelle  in signe of the leon
Myn is the ruyne  of the hye halles
The fallynge  of the toures  and of the walles
Vp on the Mynour  or the Carpenter


I slow Sampson  shakynge the piler
And myne be  the maladyes colde
The derke tresons  and the castes olde
My lookyng is the fader of pestilence
Now weepe namoore  I shal doon diligence
That Palamon  that is thyn owene knyght  
Shal haue his lady  as thou hast him hight
Though Mars shal helpe his knyght yet nathelees
Bitwixe yow  ther moot be som tyme pees
Al be ye noght of o compleccion
That causeth al day swich diusion
I am thyn Aiel  redy at thy wille
Weepe now namoore  I wol thy lust fulfille
 Now wol I stynten  of the goddes above
Of Mars  and of Venus goddesse of love
And telle yow  as pleynly as I kan
The grete effect for which that I bygan
GReet was the feeste  in Atthenes that day
And eek  the lusty seson of that May
Made euery wight  to been in such plesaunce
That al that Monday  Iusten they and daunce
And spenten it in Venus heigh seruyse
But by the cause  that they sholde ryse
Eerly  for to seen the grete fight
Vn to hir reste  wenten they at nyght
And on the morwe  whan þat day gan sprynge
Of hors and harneys  noyse and claterynge
Ther was in the hostelryes al aboute
And to the paleys  rood ther many a route
Of lordes  vp on steedes and palfreys
Ther maystow seen diuisynge of harneys
So vnkouth and so riche  and wroght so weel
Of goldsmythrye  of browdynge  and of steel


The sheeldes brighte  testeres  and trappures
Gold hewen helmes  hauberkes  Cote Armures
Lordes in paramentz  on hir courseres
Knyghtes of retenue  and eek Squieres
Nailynge the speres  and helmes bokelynge
Giggynge of sheeldes  with layneres lacynge
There as nede is  they weren no thyng ydel
The fomy steedes  on the golden brydel
Gnawynge  and faste the Armurers also
With fyle and hamer prikynge to and fro
Yemen on foyte  and communes many oon
With shorte staues  thikke as they may goon
Pypes  trompes  Nakerers  Clariounes
That in the bataille  blowen blody sounes
The paleys  ful of peples vp and doun  
Heere thre  ther ten  holdynge hir question
Dyuynynge  of thise Thebane knyghtes two
Somme seyden thus  somme seyde it shal be so
Somme helden with hym  with the blake berd
Somme with the balled  somme with the thikke herd
Somme seyde  he looked grymme  and he wolde fighte
He hath a sparth  of twenty pound of wighte
Thus was the halle  ful of diuynynge
Longe after  that the sonne gan to sprynge
The grete Theseus  that of his sleepe awaked
With Mynstralcie  and noyse þat was maked
Heeld yet the chambre  of his Paleys riche
Til that the Thebane knyghtes  bothe yliche
Honured  were  in to the paleys fet
Duc Theseus  was at a wyndow set
Arrayed  right as he were a god in Trone
The peple  preesseth thiderward ful soone
Hym for to seen  and doon heigh reuerence
And eek to herkne  his heste and his sentence
 An heraud on a Scaffold made an Oo
Til al the noyse of peple was ydo


And whan he saugh  the noyse of peple al stille
Tho shewed he  the myghty dukes wille
 The lord  hath of his heih discrecion
Considered  that it were destruccion
To gentil blood  to fighten in the gyse
Of mortal bataille  now in this emprise
Wherfore  to shapen  þat they shal nat dye
He wolde  his firste purpos modifye
 No man ther fore vp peyne of los of lyf
No maner shot polax ne short knyf
In to the lystes sende  ne thider brynge
Ne short swerd for to stoke  with poynt bitynge
No man ne drawe  ne bere by his syde
Ne no man shal  vn to his felawe ryde
But o cours  with a sharpe ygrounde spere
ffoyne if hym list on foote  hym self to were
And he  that is at meschief shal be take
And noght slayn  but be broght vn to the stake
That shal ben ordeyned  on either syde
But thider he shal by force  and there abyde
 And if so be  the chieftayn be take
On outher syde  or elles sleen his make
No lenger shal the turneiynge laste
God spede you  gooth forth  and ley on faste
With long swerd  and with Maces  fighteth youre fille
Gooth now youre wey  this is the lordes will
The voys of peple  touched the heuene  
So loude cride they  with murie steuene
God saue swich a lord  that is so good
He wilneth no destruccion of blood
Vp goon the trompes  and the melodye
And to the lystes  rit the compaignye
By ordinance  thurgh out the Citee large
Hanged with clooth of gold and nat with sarge
 fful lik a lord  this noble duc gan ryde
Thise two Thebans  vp on either side


And after rood  the queene and Emelye
And after that another compaignye
Of oon and oother  after hir degre
And thus they passen  thurgh out the Citee
And to the lystes  come they by tyme
It nas not of the day  yet fully pryme
Whan set was Theseus  ful riche and hye
Ypolita the queene and Emelye
And othere ladys  in degrees aboute
Vn to the seettes preesseth al the route
And westward  thurgh the gates vnder Marte
Arcite  and eek the hondred of his parte
With baner reed  is entred right anon
 And in that selue moment Palamon
Is vnder Venus  Estward in the place
With Baner whyt  and hardy chiere and face
In al the world  to seken vp and doun
So euene  with outen variacioun
Ther nere  swiche compaignyes tweye
ffor ther was noon so wys þat koude seye
That any hadde  of oother auauntage
Of worthynesse  ne of estaat ne age
So euene were  chosen  for to gesse
And in two renges  faire they hem dresse
 Whan þat hir names  rad were euerichon
That in hir nombre  gyle were ther noon
Tho were the gates shet and cried was loude
Do now youre deuoir  yonge knyghtes proude
 The heraudes  lefte hir prikyng vp and doun
Now ryngen trompes loude and clarioun
Ther is namoore to seyn  but west and Est
In goon the speres  ful sadly in arrest
In gooth the sharpe spore  in to the syde
Ther seen men  who kan Iuste and who kan ryde
Ther shyueren shaftes  vp on sheeldes thikke
He feeleth  thurgh the herte spoon the prikke


Vp spryngen speres  twenty foot on highte
Out gooth the swerdes  as the siluer brighte
The helmes they tohewen  and toshrede  
Out brest the blood  with stierne stremes rede
With myghty maces  the bones they tobreste
He thurgh the thikkeste  of the throng gan threste
Ther semblen steedes stronge  and doun gooth al
He rolleth vnder foot as dooth a bal
He foyneth on his feet with his tronchon
And he hym hurtleth  with his hors adoun
He thurgh the body is hurt and sithen ytake
Maugree his heed  and broght vn to the stake
As forward was right ther he moste abyde
Another lad is  on that oother syde
 And som tyme  dooth hem Theseus to reste
Hem to fresshen  and drynken if hem leste
fful ofte a day  han thise Thebanes two
Togydre ymet and wroght his felawe wo
Vnhorsed hath  ech oother of hem tweye
Ther nas no Tygre in the vale of Galgopheye
Whan þat hir whelpe is stole  whan it is lite
So crueel on the hunte  as is Arcite
ffor Ielous herte  vpon this Palamon
Ne in Belmarye  ther nys so fel leon
That hunted is  or for his hunger wood
Ne of his praye  desireth so the blood
As Palamon  to sleen his foo Arcite
The Ielous strokes  on hir helmes byte
Out renneth blood  on bothe hir sydes rede
 Som tyme an ende  ther is of euery dede
ffor er the sonne  vn to the reste wente
The stronge kyng Emetreus  gan hente
This Palamon  as he faught with Arcite
And made his swerd  depe in his flessh to byte
And by the force of twenty  is he take
Vnyolden  and ydrawe vnto the stake


And in the rescus  of this Palamon
The stronge kyng lygurge  is born adoun
And kyng Emetreus  for al his strengthe
Is born out of his sadel  a swerdes lengthe
So hitte him Palamon er he were take
But al for noght  he was broght to the stake
His hardy herte  myghte hym helpe naught
He moste abyde  whan that he was caught
By force  and eek by composicion
 Who sorweth now  but woful Palamon
That moot namoore  goon agayn to fighte
And whan þat Theseus  hadde seyn this sighte
Vn to the folk  þat foghten thus echon
He cryde  hoo namoore  for it is doon
 I wol be trewe Iuge  and no partie  
Arcite of Thebes  shal haue Emelie
That by his fortune  hath hire faire ywonne
Anon  ther is a noyse of peple bigonne
ffor Ioye of this  so loude and heighe with alle
It semed  that the lystes sholde falle
What kan now faire venus doon aboue
What seith she now  what dooth this queene of loue
But wepeth so  for wantynge of hir wille
Til that hir teeres  in the lystes fille
She seyde  I am ashamed doutelees
 Saturnus seyde  doghter hoold thy pees
Mars hath his wille  his knyght hath al his boone
And by myn heed  thow shalt been esed soone
The trompes  with the loude Mynstralcie
The heraudes  that ful loude yolle and crie
Been in hire wele  for Ioye of Daun Arcite
But herkneth me  and stynteth now a lite
Which a myracle  ther bifel anon
 This fierse Arcite  hath of his helm ydon
And on a Courser  for to shewe his face
He priketh endelong the large place


Lokynge vpward vp on Emelye
And she agayn  hym caste a freendlich eye
    
    
And was al his  chiere  as in his herte
 Out of the ground  a furie Infernal sterte
ffrom Pluto sent at requeste of Saturne
ffor which his hors  for fere gan to turne
And leepe aside  and foundred as he leepe
And er that Arcite  may taken keepe
He pighte hym  on the pomel of his heed
That in the place he lay  as he were deed
His brest tobrosten  with his sadel bowe
As blak he lay  as any cole or crowe
So was the blood  yronnen in his face
Anon he was  yborn out of the place
With herte soor  to Theseus paleys
Tho was he koruen  out of his harneys
And in a bed ybrought  ful faire and blyve
ffor he was yet in memorie  and alyue
And alwey  criynge after Emelye
 Duc Theseus  with al his compaignye
Is comen hoom  to Atthenes his Citee
With alle blisse  and greet solempnitee
Al be it that this Auenture was falle
He nolde noght disconforten hem alle
Men seyde eek that Arcite shal nat dye
He shal been heeled  of his maladye
 And of another thyng  they weren as fayn  
That of hem alle  was ther noon yslayn
Al were they soore yhurt and namely oon
That with a spere  was thirled his brest boon
To othere woundes  and to broken armes
Somme hadden salues  and somme hadden charmes
ffermacies of herbes  and eek saue
They dronken  for they wolde hir lymes haue


ffor which this noble duc as he wel kan
Conforteth  and honoureth euery man
And made reuel  al the longe nyght
Vn to the straunge lordes  as was right
Ne ther was holden  no disconfitynge
But as a Iustes  or a tourneiynge
ffor soothly  ther was no disconfiture
ffor fallyng  nys nat but an Auenture
Ne to be lad by force  vn to the stake
Vnyolden  and with twenty knyghtes take
O persone allone with outen mo
And haryed forth  by Arm  foot and too
And eke his steede  dryuen forth with staues
With footmen  bothe yemen and eek knaues
It nas aretted hym no vileynye
Ther may no man  clepen it cowardye
 ffor which anon  duc Theseus leet crye
To stynten  alle rancour and enuye
The gree  as wel of o syde as of oother
And eyther syde ylik as ootheres brother
And yaf hem yiftes  after hir degree
And fully  heeld a feeste  dayes three
And conuoyed  the kynges worthily
Out of his toun  a Iournee largely
And hoom wente euery man the righte way
Ther was namoore  but fare wel  haue good day
Of this bataille  I wol namoore endite
But speke of Palamon and of Arcyte
Swelleth the brest of arcite  and the soore
Encreesseth at his herte  moore and moore
The clothered blood  for any lechecraft
Corrupteth  and is in his bouk ylaft
That neither veyne blood  ne ventusynge
Ne drynke of herbes  may ben his helpynge
The vertu expulsif  or Animal
ffro thilke vertu  cleped natural


Ne may the venym  voyden ne expelle
The pipes of his longes  gonne to swelle
And euery lacerte  in his brest adoun
Is shent with venym and corrupcion
Hym gayneth neither for to gete his lif  
Vomyt vpward  ne dounward laxatif
Al is tobrosten  thilke Regioun
Nature hath now  no dominacioun
And certeinly  ther Nature wol nat wirche
ffare wel Phisik go ber the man to chirche
This al and som  that Arcita moot dye
ffor which  he sendeth  after Emelye
And Palamon  that was his cosyn deere
Thanne seyde he thus  as ye shal after heere
 Naught may  the woful spirit in myn herte
Declare o point of alle my sorwes smerte
To yow my lady  that I loue moost
But I biquethe  the seruyce of my goost
To yow  abouen euery creature
Syn þat my lyf   may no lenger dure
Allas the wo  allas the peynes stronge
That I for yow haue suffred  and so longe
Allas the deeth  allas myn Emelye
Allas  departynge of our compaignye
Allas myn hertes queene  allas my wyf
Myn hertes lady  endere of my lyf
What is this world  what asketh men to haue
Now with his loue  now in his colde graue
Allone  with outen any compaignye
ffare wel  my swete foo  myn Emelye
And softe taak me  in youre Armes tweye
ffor loue of god  and herkneth what I seye
I haue heer  with my cosyn Palamon
Had strif and rancour many a day agon
ffor loue of yow  and for my Ialousye
And Iuppiter  so wys my soule gye


To speken  of a seruant proprely
With alle circumstances trewely
That is to seyn  trouthe  honour knyghthede
Wysdom  humblesse  estaat and heigh kynrede
ffredom  and al that longeth to that Art
So Iuppiter  haue of my soule part
As in this world  right now ne knowe I non
So worthy to ben loued as Palamon
That serueth yow  and wol doon al his lyf
And if that euere  ye shul ben a wyf
fforyet nat Palamon  the gentil man
And with that word  his speche faille gan
And from his herte  vp to his brest was come
The coold of deeth  that hadde hym ouercome
And yet moore ouer  for in hise Armes two
The vital strengthe is lost  and al ago
Oonly  the intellect with outen moore  
That dwelled in his herte  syk and soore
Gan faillen  when the herte felte deeth
Dusked hise eyen two  and failled breeth
But on his lady yet caste he his eye
His laste word  was mercy Emelye
His spirit chaunged hous  and wente ther
As I cam neuere  I kan nat tellen wher
Therfore I stynte  I nam no diuinistre
Of soules  fynde I nat in this Registre
Ne me ne list thilke opinions to telle
Of hem  though þat they writen wher they dwelle
Arcite is coold  ther Mars his soule gye
Now wol I speken forth of Emelye
Shrighte Emelye  and howleth Palamon
And Theseus  his suster took anon
Swownynge  and baar hire fro the corps away
What helpeth it to tarien forth the day
To tellen how she weepe  bothe eue and morwe
ffor in swich cas  wommen haue swich sorwe


Whan þat hir housbond  is from hem ago
That for the moore part they sorwen so
Or ellis  fallen in swich maladye
That at the laste  certeinly they dye
 Infinite  been the sorwes and the teeres
Of olde folk  and eek of tendre yeeres
In al the toun  for deeth of this Theban
ffor hym ther wepeth  bothe child and man
So greet a wepyng was ther noon certayn
Whan Ector was ybroght  al fressh yslayn
To Troye  allas the pitee þat was ther
Cracchynge of chekes  rentynge eek of heer
Why woldestow be deed  thise wommen crye
And haddest gold ynough  and Emelye
 No man  myghte gladen Theseus
Sauynge  his olde fader Egeus
That knew  this worldes transmutacion
As he hadde  seyn it  vp and doun
Ioye after wo  and wo after gladnesse
And shewed  hem ensamples and liknesse
Right as ther  dyed neuere man quod he
That he ne lyuede in erthe  in som degree
Right so  ther lyuede neuer man he seyde
In al this world  þat som tyme he ne deyde
This world  nys but a thurghfare ful of wo
And we been pilgrymes  passynge to and fro
Deeth is an ende  of euery worldes soore
And ouer al this  yet seyde he muchel moore
To this effect ful wisely  to enhorte  
The peple  that they sholde hem reconforte
Duc Theseus  with al his bisy cure
Cast now  wher that the sepulture
Of goode Arcite  may best ymaked be
And eek moost honurable in his degree
And at the laste  he took conclusion
That ther as first Arcite and Palamon


Hadden for loue  the bataille hem bitwene
That in that selue groue  swoote and grene
Ther as he hadde  hise amorouse desires
His compleynte  and for loue hise hoote fires
He wolde make a fyr  in which the office
ffuneral  he myghte al accomplice
And leet comande anon  to hakke and hewe
The okes olde  and leye hem on a rewe
In colpons  wel arrayed for to brenne
Hise Officers  with swifte feet they renne
And ryden anon  at his comandement
And after  this  Theseus hath ysent
After a beere  and it al ouer spradde
With clooth of gold  the richeste  þat he hadde
And of the same suyte  he cladde Arcite
Vp on his hondes  hadde he gloues white
Eek on his heed  a coroune of laurer grene
And in his hond  a swerd ful bright and kene
He leyde hym bare the visage  on the beere
Therwith he weepe  that pitee was to heere
And for the peple  sholde seen hym alle
Whan it was day  he broghte hym to the halle
That roreth  of the criyng and the soun
 Tho cam this woful Theban Palamon
With flotery berd  and rugged asshy heeres
In clothes blake  ydropped al with teeres
And passynge othere  of wepynge Emelye
The rewefulleste  of al the compaignye
 In as muche  as the seruyce sholde be
The moore noble  and riche in his degree
Duc Theseus  leet forth thre steedes brynge
That trapped were in steel al gliterynge
And couered with the armes of daun Arcite
Vp on thise steedes  grete and white
Ther sitten folk of whiche oon baar his sheeld
Another his spere  in his hondes heeld


The thridde baar with hym  his bowe Turkeys
Of brend gold  was the caas  and eek the harneys
And riden forth a paas  with sorweful cheere
Toward the groue  as ye shul after heere
The nobleste of the grekes  that ther were  
Vp on hir shuldres  caryeden the beere
With slak paas  and eyen rede and wete
Thurgh out the Citee  by the maister strete
That sprad was al with blak  and wonder hye
Right of the same  is the strete ywrye
Vp on the right hond  wente olde Egeus
And on that oother syde  duc Theseus
With vessel in hir hand  of gold ful fyn
Al ful of hony  Milk and blood and wyn
Eek Palamon  with ful greet compaignye
And after that  cam woful Emelye
With fyr in honde  as was that tyme the gyse
To do the office  of funeral seruyse
Heigh labour and ful greet apparaillynge
Was at the seruice  and the fyr makynge
That with his grene tope  the heuen 
And twenty fadme of brede  the armes straughte
This is to seyn  the bowes weren so brode
Of stree first ther was leyd ful many a lode
But how the fyr  was maked vp on highte
And eek the names  that the trees highte
As ook  firre  birch  Aspe  Alder  holm  popeler
Wylugh  Elm  plane  Assh  box  chasteyn  lynde  laurer
Mapul  thorn  bech  hasel  Ew  whippeltre
How they weren fild  shal nat be toold for me
Ne hou the goddes ronnen vp and doun
Disherited  of hire habitacioun
In whiche they woneden  in reste and pees
Nymphus  ffawnes  and Amadrides
Ne hou the beestes  and the briddes alle
ffledden for fere  whan the wode was falle


Ne how the ground  agast was of the light
That was nat wont to seen the sonne bright
Ne how the fyr  was couched first with stree
And thanne with drye stokkes  clouen a thre
And thanne with grene wode and spicerye
And thanne with clooth of gold  and with perrye
And gerlandes  hangynge  with ful many a flour
The Mirre  thencens  with al so greet odour
Ne how Arcite  lay among al this
Ne what richesse  aboute his body is
Ne how that Emelye  as was the gyse
Putte in the fyr  of funeral seruyse
Ne how she swowned  whan men made fyr
Ne what she spak ne what was hir desire
Ne what Ieweles  men in the fyre caste
Whan þat the fyr was greet and brente faste
 Ne how somme caste hir sheeld  and somme hir spere  
And of hire vestimentz  whiche þat they were
And coppes full of wyn  and Milk and blood
In to the fyr  that brente  as it were wood
Ne how the grekes  with an huge route
Tries riden  al the place aboute
Vp on the left hand  with a loud shoutynge
And thries  with hir speres claterynge
And thries  how the ladyes gonne crye
And how  þat lad was homward Emelye
Ne how Arcite  is brent to asshen colde
Ne  how that lych wake  was yholde
Al thilke nyght  ne how the grekes pleye
The wake pleyes  ne kepe I nat to seye
Who wrastleth best naked  with oille enoynt
Ne who that baar hym best in no disioynt
 I wol nat tellen eek how that they goon
Hoom til Atthenes  whan the pley is doon
But shortly to the point thanne wol I wende
And maken  of my longe tale an ende


By processe  and by lengthe of certeyn yeres
Al styntyd is  the moornynge and the teres
Of grekes  by oon general assent
Thanne semed me  ther was a parlement
At Atthenes  vpon certein poyntz and caas
Among the whiche poyntz  yspoken was
To haue with certein contrees alliance
And have fully of Thebans obeissance
ffor which  this noble Theseus anon
Leet senden  after gentil Palamon
Vnwist of hym  what was the cause and why
But in hise blake clothes  sorwefully
He cam  at his comandement in hye
Tho sente  Theseus for Emelye
Whan they were set and hust was al the place
And Thesens  abiden hadde a space
Er any word  cam fram his wise brest
Hise eyen sette he  ther as was his lest
And with a sad visage  he siked stille
And after that right thus he seyde his wille
The firste moeuere of the cause aboue
Whan he first made  the faire cheyne of loue
Greet was theffect and heigh was his entente
Wel wiste he why  and what ther of he mente
ffor with that faire cheyne of loue he bond
The fyr  the eyr  the water and the lond
In certeyn boundes  that they may nat flee
That same prince  and that same moeuere quod he
Hath stablissed  in this wrecched world adoun  
Certeyne dayes  and duracioun
To al  that is engendrid in this place
Ouer the which day  they may nat pace
Al mowe they yet tho dayes wel abregge
Ther nedeth noght noon Auctoritee allegge
ffor it is preeued  by experience
But that me list declaren my sentence


Thanne may men  by this ordre wel discerne
That thilke moeuere  stable is and eterne
Wel may men knowe  but it be a fool
That euery part dirryueth from his hool
ffor nature  hath taken his bigynnyng
Of no partie  or of cantel of a thyng
But of a thyng that parfit is and stable
Descendynge so  til it be corrumpable
And therfore  of his wise purueiaunce
He hath  so wel biset his ordinaunce
That speces of thynges  and progressions
Shullen enduren  by successions
And nat eterne  with outen any lye
This maystow vnderstonde  and seen it eye
Loo the ook  þat hath so long a norisshynge
ffrom tyme  þat it first bigynneth sprynge
And hath so long a lif  as we may see
Yet at the laste  wasted is the tree
 Considereth eek how that the harde stoon
Vnder oure feet on which we trede and goon
Yit wasteth it as it lyth by the weye
The brode Ryuer  somtyme wexeth dreye
The grete toures  se we wane and wende
Thanne may ye se  þat al this thyng hath ende
 Of man and womman  seen we wel also
That nedeth  in oon of thise termes two
This is to seyn  in youthe  or elles age
He moot be deed  the kyng as shal a page
Som in his bed  som in the depe see
Som in the large feeld  as men may se
Ther helpeth noght al goth that ilke weye
Thanne may I seyn  al this thyng moot deye
 What maketh this  but Iuppiter the kyng
That is prince  and cause of alle thyng
Conuertynge al  vn to his propre welle
ffrom which it is dirryued  sooth to telle


And here agayns  no creature on lyue
Of no degree  auailleth for to stryue
 Thanne is it wysdom  as it thynketh me
To maken vertu of necessitee
 And take it weel  that we may nat eschue  
And namely  that to vs alle is due
And who so gruccheth ought he dooth folye
And rebel is  to hym that al may gye
And certeinly  a man hath moost honour
To dyen  in his excellence and flour
Whan he is siker  of his goode name
Thanne hath he doon  his freend ne hym no shame
And gladder  oghte his freend been of his deeth
Whan with honour  vp yolden is his breeth
Than whan his name  apalled is for age
ffor al forgeten  is his vassellage
Thanne is it best as for a worthy fame
To dyen  whan þat he is best of name
 The contrarie of al this  is wilsulnesse
Why grucchen we  why haue we heuynesse
That goode Arcite  of Chiualrie flour
Departed is  with duetee and honour
Out of this foule prison of this lyf
Why grucchen heere  his cosyn and his wyf
Of his wel fare  that loued hem so weel
Kan he hem thank nay god woot neuer a deel
That bothe his soule  and eek hem self offende
And yet they mowe  hir lustes nat amende
What may I concluden  of this longe serye
But after wo  I rede vs to be merye
And thanken Iuppiter  of al his grace
And er that we  departen from this place
I rede  we make  of sorwes two
O parfit ioye  lastynge eueremo
And looketh now  wher moost sorwe is her Inne
Ther wol we first amenden and bigynne


Suster quod he  this is my fulle assent
With all thavys  heere of my parlement
That gentil Palamon  thyn owene knyght
That serueth yow  with wille  herte  and myght
And euere hath doon  syn þat ye first hym knewe
That ye shul of your grace  vp on hym rewe
And taken hym  for housbonde and for lord
Leue me youre hond  for this is oure accord
Lat se now  of youre wommanly pitee
He is a kynges brother sone pardee
And though he were  a poure bacheler
Syn he hath serued yow  so many a yeer
And had for yow  so greet Aduersitee
It moste been considered  leeueth me
ffor gentil mercy  oghte to passen right
 Thanne seyde he thus  to Palamon ful right
I trowe  ther nedeth litel sermonyng  
To make yow  assente to this thyng
Com neer  and taak youre lady by the hond
Bitwixen hem  was maad anon the bond
That highte matrimoigne  or mariage
By al the conseil  and the Baronage
 And thus  with alle blisse and melodye
Hath Palamon  ywedded Emelye
And god  þat al this wyde world hath wroght
Sende hym his loue  that it deere aboght
ffor now is Palamon  in alle wele
Lyuynge in blisse  in richesse and in heele
And Emelye  hym loueth so tendrely
And he hire  serueth so gentilly
That neuere  was ther no word hem bitwene
Of Ialousie  or any oother tene
Thus endeth Palamon and Emelye
And God saue  al this faire compaignye Amen
Whan that the knyght had thus his tale ytoold
In al the route  ne was ther yong ne oold
That he ne seyde  it was a noble storie
And worthy  for to drawen to memorie
And namely the gentils euerichon
Oure hoost lough  and swoor so moot I gon
This gooth aright  vnbokeled is the Male
Lat se now  who shal telle another tale
ffor trewely  the game is wel bigonne
Now telleth on sire Monk  if that ye konne
Sumwhat to quite with the knyghtes tale
The Millere  that fordronken was al pale
So that vnnethe  vp on his hors he sat
He nolde aualen  neither hood ne hat
Ne abyde no man  for his curteisie
But in Pilates voys  he gan to crie
And swoor by Armes  and by blood  and bones
I kan a noble tale for the nones
With which  I wol now quite  the knyghtes tale
Oure hoost saugh  that he was dronke of ale
And seyde  abyd Robyn my leeue brother
Som bettre man  shal telle vs first another
Abyde  and lat vs werken thriftily  
 By goddes soule quod he  that wol nat I
ffor I wol speke  or elles go my wey
Oure hoost answerde  tel on a deuele wey
Thou art a fool  thy wit is ouercome
 Now herkneth quod the Millere alle and some
But first I make a protestacioun
That I am dronke  I knowe it by my soun
And therfore  if that I mysspeke or seye
Wyte it the Ale of Southwerk I  preye


ffor I wol telle  a legende and a lyf
Bothe of a Carpenter  and of his wyf
How that a clerk  hath set the wrightes cappe
 The Reue answerde  and seyde stynt thy clappe
Lat be  thy lewed dronken harlotrye
It is a synne  and eek a greet folye
To apeyren any man  or hym defame
And eek to bryngen wyues in swich fame
Thou mayst ynogh  of othere thynges seyn
 This dronke Millere  spak ful soone ageyn
And seyde  leue brother Osewold
Who hath no wyf  he is no Cokewold
But I sey nat therfore  that thou art oon
Ther been ful goode wyues many oon
And euere  a thousand goode  ayeyns oon badde
That knowestow wel thy self  but if thou madde
Why artow angry  with my tale now
I haue a wyf pardee  as wel as thow
Yet nolde I  for the oxen in my plogh
Take vp on me  moore than ynogh
As demen of my self  that I were oon
I wol bileue wel  that I am noon
An housbonde  shal nat been Inquisityf
Of goddes pryuetee  nor of his wyf
So he may fynde goddes foyson there
Of the remenant nedeth nat enquere
 What sholde I moore seyn  but this Millere
He nolde his wordes  for no man forbere
But tolde his cherles tale in his manere
Mathynketh  that I shal reherce it heere
And therfore euery gentil wight I preye
ffor goddes loue  demeth nat that I seye
Of yuel entente  but that I moot reherce
Hir tales alle  be they bettre or werse
Or elles  falsen som of my mateere
And therfore  who so list it nat yheere


Turne ouer the leef  and chese another tale
ffor he shal fynde ynowe  grete and smale
Of storial thyng that toucheth gentillesse  
And eek moralitee  and hoolynesse
Blameth nat me  if that ye chese amys
The Millere  is a cherl  ye knowe wel this
So was the Reue  and othere manye mo
And harlotrie  they tolden bothe two
Auyseth yow  putteth me out of blame
And eek men shal nat maken ernest of game
WHilom  ther was dwellynge at Oxenford
A riche gnof  that gestes heeld to bord
And of his craft he was a Carpenter
With hym  ther was dwellynge a poure scoler
Hadde lerned Art but al his fantasye
Was turned  for to lerne Astrologye
And koude  a certeyn of conclusions
To demen  by Interrogacions
If þat men asked hym  in certein houres
Whan þat men sholde haue droghte or elles shoures
Or if men asked hym  what sholde bifalle
Of euery thyng  I may nat rekene hem alle
 This clerk was cleped  hende Nicholas
Of deerne loue he koude and of solas
And therto  he was sleigh  and ful priuee
And lyk a mayden  meke for to see
A chambre hadde he in that hostelrye
Allone  withouten any compaignye
fful fetisly ydight with herbes swoote
And he hym self  as sweete as is the roote
Of lycorys  or any Cetewale
His Almageste  and bookes grete and smale
His Astrelabie  longynge for his Art
His Augrym stones  layen faire a part
On shelues  couched at his beddes heed
His presse ycovered  with a faldyng reed
And all aboue  ther lay a gay Sautrie
On which  he made a nyghtes melodie
So swetely  that al the chambre rong
And Angelus ad virginem  he song
And after that he song the kynges noote
fful often  blessed was his myrie throte


And thus  this sweete clerk his tyme spente
After his freendes fyndyng and his rente
 This Carpenter  hadde wedded newe a wyf
Which that he louede  moore than his lyf 
Of xviij yeer  she was of Age  
Ialous he was  and heeld hire narwe in cage
ffor she was yong and wylde  and he was old
And demed hym self been lik  a Cokewold
He knew nat Catoun  for his wit was rude
That bad  man sholde wedde his simylitude
Men sholde wedden after hire estaat
ffor youthe and elde  is often at debaat
But sith that he  was fallen in the snare
He moste endure  as oother folk his care
 ffair was this yonge wyf  and ther with al
As any wezele  hir body  gent and smal
A ceynt she werede  ybarred al of silk
A barmclooth   as whit as morne Milk
Vp on hir lendes  ful of many a goore
Whit was hir smok  and broyden al bifoore
And eek bihynde  on hir coler aboute
Of colblak silk  withInne and eek withoute
The tapes  of hir white voluper
Were of the same suyte of hir coler
Hir filet brood of silk and set ful hye
And sikerly  she hadde a likerous eye
fful smale ypulled  were hire browes two
And tho were bent  and blake as any sloo
She was  ful moore blisful on to see
Than is  the newe  pereionette tree
And softer  than the wolle is of a wether
And by hir girdel  heeng a purs of lether
Tasseled with grene  and perled with latoun
In al this world  to seken vp and doun
There nas no man so wys  þat koude thenche
So gay a popelote  or swich a wenche


fful brighter  was the shynyng of hir hewe
Than in the tour  the noble yforged newe
 But of hir song  it was  as loude and yerne
As any swalwe  sittynge on a berne
Ther to  she koude skippe  and make game
As any kyde  or calf  folwynge his dame
Hir mouth was sweete  as bragot or the Meeth
Or hoord of Apples  leyd in hey or heeth
Wynsynge she was  as is a ioly colt
Long as a Mast and vprighte as a bolt
A brooch sche baar  vp on hir loue coler
As brood  as is the boos of a bokeler
Hir shoes were laced  on hir legges hye
She was a prymerole  a piggesnye
ffor any lord  to leggen in his bedde
Or yet for any good yeman to wedde
NOw sire  and eft sire  so bifel the cas  
That on a day  this hende Nicholas
ffil with this yonge wyf  to rage and pleye
Whil that hir housbonde was at Oseneye
As clerkes  ben ful subtile  and ful queynte
And priuely  he caughte hire by the queynte
And seyde ywis  but if ich haue my wille
ffor deerne loue of thee  lemman I spille
And heeld hire harde  by the haunche bones
And seyde  lemman loue me al atones
Or I wol dyen  also god me saue
And she sproong  as a colt doth in the traue
And with hir heed  sche wryed faste awey
And seyde  I wol nat kisse thee  by my fey
Why lat be quod ich  lat be Nicholas
Or I wol crie  out  harrow  and allas
Do wey youre handes  for your curteisye
 This Nicholas  gan mercy for to crye
And spak so faire  and profred hire so faste
That she hir loue  hym graunted atte laste


And swoor hir ooth  by seint Thomas of Kent
That she wol been  at his comandement
Whan þat she may  hir leyser wel espie
Myn housbonde  is so ful of Ialousie
That but ye wayte wel  and been priuee
I woot right wel  I nam but deed quod she
Ye moste been ful deerne  as in this cas
 Nay ther of  care thee noght quod Nicholas
A clerk hadde litherly  biset his whyle
But if he koude  a Carpenter bigyle
And thus they been  accorded and ysworn
To wayte a tyme  as I haue told biforn
 Whan Nicholas  had doon thus euerideel
And thakked hire  aboute the lendes weel
He kist hire sweete  and taketh his sawtrie
And pleyeth faste  and maketh melodie
Thanne fil it thus  þat to the paryssh chirche
Cristes  owene werkes  for to wirche
This goode wyf  went on an haliday
Hir forheed shoon  as bright as any day
So was it wasshen  whan she leet hir werk
 Now was ther of that chirche a parissh clerk
The which  that was ycleped Absolon
Crul was his heer  and as the gold it shoon
And strouted as a ffanne  large and brode
fful streight and euene  lay his ioly shode
His rode was reed  hise eyen greye as goos
With Powles wyndow  coruen on his shoos
In hoses rede  he wente fetisly  
Yclad he was  ful smal and proprely
Al in a kirtel  of a lyght waget
fful faire and thikke  been the poyntes set
And ther vp on  he hadde a gay surplys
As whit as is  the blosme vp on the rys
A myrie child he was  so god me saue
Wel koude he laten blood  and clippe and shaue


And maken a chartre of lond  or Acquitaunce
In twenty manere  koude he trippe and daunce
After the scole  of Oxenford tho
And with his legges  casten to and fro
And pleyen songes  on a small Rubible
Ther to  he song som tyme  a loud quynyble
And as wel  koude he pleye  on his giterne
In al the toun  nas Brewhous ne Tauerne
That he ne visited  with his solas
Ther any gaylard Tappestere was
But sooth to seyn  he was somdel squaymous
Of fartyng  and of speche daungerous
 This Absolon  þat iolif was and gay
Gooth with a Sencer  on the haliday
Sensynge the wyues  of the parisshe faste
And many a louely look  on hem he caste
And namely  on this Carpenteris wyf
To loke on hire  hym thoughte a myrie lyf
She was so propre  and sweete and likerous
I dar wel seyn  if she hadde been a Mous
And he a Cat  he wold hire hente anon
 This parissh clerk  this ioly Absolon
Hath in his herte  swich a loue longynge
That of no wyf  took he noon offrynge
ffor curteisie  he seyde he wolde noon
The Moone  whan it was nyght  ful brighte shoon
And Absolon  his gyterne hath ytake
ffor paramours  be thoghte for to wake
And forth he gooth  iolif and amorous
Til he cam  to the Carpenteres hous
A litel  after Cokkes hadde ycrowe
And dressed hym vp  by a shotwyndowe
That was  vp on the Carpenteris wal
He syngeth in his voys  gentil and smal
Now deere lady  if thy wille be
I pray yow  that ye wole thynke on me


fful wel acordaunt to his gyternynge
This Carpenter awook  and herde synge
And spak vn to his wyf  and seyde anon
What Alison  herestow nat Absolon
That chaunteth thus  vnder oure boures wal  
And she answerde hir housbonde  ther with al
Yis God woot Iohn  I heere it euery del
 This passeth forth  what wol ye bet than weel
ffro day to day  to day  this ioly Absolon
So woweth hire  that hym is wo bigon
He waketh  al the nyght  and al the day
He kembeth hise lokkes brode  and made hym gay
He woweth hire  by meenes  and brocage
And swoor  he wolde been hir owene page
He syngeth brokkynge  as a nyghtyngale
He sente hire pyment Meeth and spiced Ale
And wafres  pipyng  hoot  out of the gleede
And for she was of toune  he profreth meede
ffor som folk wol ben wonnen for richesse
And somme for strokes  and somme for gentillesse
 Somtyme  to shewe his lightnesse and maistrye
He pleyeth Herodes vp on a Scaffold hye
But what auailleth hym  as in this cas
She loueth so  this hende Nicholas
That Absolon  may blowe the bukkes horn
He ne hadde  for his labour but a scorn
And thus  she maketh Absolon hire Ape
And al his ernest turneth til a Iape
fful sooth is this prouerbe  it is no lye
Men seyn right thus  alwey the nye slye
Maketh  the ferre leeue to be looth
ffor though that Absolon  be wood or wrooth
By cause  that he fer was from hire sighte
This nye Nicholas  stood in his lighte
NOw bere thee wel  thou hende Nicholas
ffor Absolon  may waille and synge allas


And so bifel it on a Saterday
This Carpenter  was goon til Osenay
And hende Nicholas and Alisoun
Acorded been  to this conclusioun
That Nicholas  shal shapen hym a wyle
This sely Ialous housbonde to bigyle
And if so be  the game wente aright
She sholde slepen  in his arm al nyght
ffor this was  his desir  and hire also
And right anon  withouten wordes mo
This Nicholas  no lenger wolde tarie
But dooth ful softe  vn to his chambre carie
Bothe mete and drynke  for a day or tweye
And to hire housbonde  bad hire for to seye
If that he axed  after Nicholas
She sholde seye  she nyste where he was
Of al that day  she saugh hym nat with eye  
She trowed  that he was in maladye
ffor  for no cry  hir mayde koude hym calle
He nolde answere  for thyng that myghte falle
 This passeth forth  al thilke Saterday
That Nicholas  stille in his chambre lay
And eet and sleepe  or dide what hym leste
Til Sonday  that the sonne gooth to reste
 This sely Carpenter  hath greet merueyle
Of Nicholas  or what thyng myghte hym eyle
And seyde  I am adrad by Seint Thomas
It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas
God shilde  that he deyde sodeynly
This world  is now ful tikel sikerly
I saugh to day  a cors yborn to chirche
That now  on monday last  I saugh hym wirche
 Go vp quod he  vn to his knaue anoon
Clepe at his dore  or knokke with a stoon
Looke how it is  and tel me boldely
 This knaue  gooth him vp ful sturdily


And at the chambre dore  whil that he stood
He cride and knokked  as that he were wood
What how  what do ye maister Nicholay
How may ye slepen  al the longe day
 But al for noght he herde nat a word
An hole he foond  ful lowe vp on a bord
Ther as the Cat was wont In for to crepe
And at that hole  he looked In ful depe
And at the laste  he hadde of hym a sighte
This Nicholas  sat capyng euere vprighte
As he had kiked  on the newe moone
Adoun he gooth  and tolde his maister soone
In what array  he saugh that ilke man
 This Carpenter  to blessen hym bigan
And seyde  help vs seinte ffrydeswyde
A man woot litel  what hym shal bityde
This man is falle  with his Astromye
In som woodnesse  or in som Agonye
I thoghte ay wel  how that it sholde be
Men sholde nat knowe  of goddes pryuetee
Ye  blessed be alwey a lewed man
That noght but oonly his bileue kan
So ferde another clerk with Astromye
He walked in the feeldes  for to prye
Vp on the sterres  what ther sholde bifalle
Til he was  in a Marleput yfalle
He saugh nat that  but yet by seint 
Me reweth soore  of hende Nicholas
He shal be rated  of his studiyng  
If that I may  by Ihesus heuene kyng
 Get me a staf  that I may vnderspore
Whil þat thou Robyn  heuest of the dore
He shal  out of his studiyng as I gesse
And to the chambre dore  he gan hym dresse
His knaue  was a strong carl  for the noones
And by the haspe  he haaf it of atones


In to the floor  the dore fil anon
This Nicholas  sat ay as stille as stoon
And euere caped vpward in to the Eir
This Carpenter  wende he were in despeir
And hente hym  by the sholdres myghtily
And shook hym harde  and cride spitously
What Nicholay  what how  what looke adoun
Awake  and thenk on Cristes passioun
I crouche thee  from Elues  and fro wightes
Therwith the nyghtspel  seyde he anonrightes
On foure halues  of the hous aboute
And on the thresshfold  of the dore withoute
Ihesu Crist and seint Benedight
Blesse this hous  from euery wikked wight
ffor nyghtes uerye  the white pater noster
Where wentestow  seint Petres soster
 And atte laste  this hende Nicholas
Gan for to sike soore  and seyde allas
Shal al this world  be lost eftsoones now
 This Carpenter  answerde  what seystow
What thynk on god  as we doon  men þat swynke
 This Nicholas answerde  fecche me drynke
And after  wol I speke in pryuetee
Of certeyn thyng that toucheth me and thee
I wol telle it noon oother man certeyn
 This Carpenter  goth doun  and comth ageyn
And broghte  of myghty Ale a large quart
And whan þat ech of hem  had dronke his part
This Nicholas  his dore faste shette
And doun the Carpenter  by hym he sette
 He seyde Iohn myn hoost lief and deere
Thou shalt vp on thy trouthe swere me heere
That to no wight thou shalt this conseil wreye
ffor it is  cristes conseil that I seye
And if thou telle man  thou art forlore
ffor this vengaunce  thou shalt han therfore


That if thou wreye me  thou shalt be wood
Nay Crist forbede it for his hooly blood
Quod tho this sely man  I nam no labbe
Ne though I seye  I am nat lief to gabbe
Sey what thou wolt  I shal it neuere telle  
To child ne wyf  by hym that harwed helle
NOw Iohn quod Nicholas  I wol nat lye
I have yfounde  in myn Astrologye
As I haue looked  in the moone bright
That now a monday next at quarter nyght
Shal falle a reyn  and that so wilde and wood
That half so greet was neuere Noees flood
This world he seyde  in lasse than an hour
Shal al be dreynt  so hidous is the shour
Thus schal mankynde drenche  and lese hir lyf
 This Carpenter answerde  allas my wyf
And shal she drenche  allas myn Alisoun
ffor sorwe of this  he fil almoost adoun
And seyde  is ther no remedie in this cas
 Why yis for gode  quod hende Nicholas
If thou wolt werken  aftir loore and reed
Thou mayst nat werken  after thyn owene heed
ffor thus seith Salomon  that was ful trewe
Werk al by conseil  and thou shalt nat rewe
And if thou werken wolt by good conseil
I vndertake  withouten Mast and seyl
Yet shal I sauen  hire  and thee  and me
Hastow nat herd  hou saued was Noe
Whan þat oure lord  hadde warned hym biforn
That al the world  with water sholde be lorn
 Yis quod this Carpenter  ful yoore ago
 Hastou nat herd  quod Nicholas also
The sorwe of Noe  with his felaweshipe
Er þat he myghte  brynge his wyf to shipe
Hym hadde be leuere  I dar wel vndertake
At thilke tyme  than alle hise wetheres blake


That she hadde had a shipe  hir self allone
And therfore  woostou what is best to doone
This asketh haste  and of an hastif thyng
Men may nat preche  or maken tariyng
 Anon go gete vs faste in to this In
A knedyng trogh  or ellis a kymelyn
ffor ech of vs  but loke þat they be large
In whiche  we mowe swymme as in a barge
And han therInne  vitaille suffisant
But for a day  fy on the remenant
The water shal aslake  and goon away
Aboute pryme  vp on the nexte day
But Robyn  may nat wite of this  thy knaue
Ne eek thy mayde Gille I may nat saue
Axe nat why  for though thou aske me
I wol nat tellen goddes pryuetee
Suffiseth thee  but if thy wittes madde  
To han as greet a grace  as Noe hadde
Thy wyf shal I wel sauen  out of doute
Go now thy wey  and speed thee heer aboute
 But whan thou hast for hire and thee and me
Ygeten vs  thise knedyng tubbes thre
Thanne shaltow hange hem  in the roof ful hye
That no man  of oure purueiaunce spye
And whan thou thus hast doon  as I haue seyd
And hast oure vitaille  faire in hem yleyd
And eek an Ax  to smyte the corde atwo
Whan þat the water comth  that we may go
And broke an hole  an heigh vp on the gable
Vnto the gardynward  ouer the stable
That we may frely  passen forth oure way
Whan þat the grete shour  is goon away
Thanne shal I swymme  as myrie I vndertake
As dooth the white doke  after hire drake
Thanne wol I clepe  how Alison  how Iohn
Be myrie  for the flood wol passe anon


And thou wolt seyn  hayl maister Nicholay
Good morwe  I se thee wel  for it is day
And thanne  shul we be  lordes al oure lyf
Of al the world  as Noe and his wyf
 But of o thyng I warne thee ful right
Be wel auysed  on that ilke nyght
That we ben entred  in to shippes bord
That noon of vs  ne speke nat a word
Ne clepe  ne crie  but been in his preyere
ffor it is  goddes owene heeste deere
 Thy wyf and thou  moote hange fer atwynne
ffor that bitwixe yow  shal be no synne
Na moore in lookyng  than ther shal in deede
This ordinance is seyd  so god thee speede
Tomorwe at nyght whan folk ben alle aslepe
In to our knedyng tubbes  wol we crepe
And sitten there  abidyng goddes grace
Go now thy wey  I haue no lenger space
To make of this  no lenger sermonyng
Men seyn thus  sende the wise  and sey no thyng
Thou art so wys it needeth thee nat to preche
Go saue oure lyf  and that I the biseche
 This sely Carpenter  goth forth his wey
fful ofte  he seith allas and weylawey
And to his wyf  he tolde his pryueetee
And she was war  and knew it bet than he
What al this queynte cast was for to seye
But nathelees  she ferde as she wolde deye
And seyde allas  go forth thy wey anon  
Help vs to scape  or we been lost echon
I am thy trewe  verray wedded wyf
Go deere spouse  and help to saue oure lyf
LO  which a greet thyng  is Affeccion
Men may dyen  of ymaginacion
So depe  may impression be take
This sely Carpenter  bigynneth quake


Hym thynketh verraily  that he may see
Noees flood  come walwynge as the see
To drenchen Alisoun  his hony deere
He wepeth  weyleth  maketh sory cheere
He siketh  with ful many a sory swogh
He gooth  and geteth hym a knedyng trogh
And after that  a tubbe and a kymelyn
And pryuely  he sente hem to his In
And heng hem  in the roof in pryuetee
His owene hand made laddres thre
To clymben  by the ronges and the stalkes
In to the tubbes  hangynge in the balkes
And hem vitailleth  bothe trogh and tubbe
With breed and chese  and good Ale in a Iubbe
Suffisynge right ynogh  as for a day
But er that he  hadde maad al this array
He sente his knaue  and eek his wenche also
Vp on his nede  to london for to go
And on the Monday  whan it drow to nyght
He shette his dore  withoute candel lyght
And dresseth alle thyng as it shal be
And shortly  vp they clomben alle thre
They sitten stille  wel a furlong way
 Now Pater noster  clom seyde Nicholay
And clom quod Iohn  and clom seyde Alisoun
This Carpenter  seyde his deuocioun
And stille he sit  and biddeth his preyere
Awaitynge on the reyn  if he it heere
 The dede sleepe  for wery bisynesse
ffil on this Carpenter  right as I gesse
Aboute corfew tyme  or litel moore
ffor trauaille of his goost he groneth soore
And eft he routeth  for his heed myslay
Doun of the laddre  stalketh Nicholay
And Alisoun  ful softe adoun she spedde
Withouten wordes mo  they goon to bedde


Ther as the Carpenter  is wont to lye
Ther was the reuel  and the melodye
And thus  Alison  and Nicholas
In bisynesse  of myrthe and of solas
Til that the belle of laudes gan to rynge  
And freres in the Chauncel gonne synge
This parissh clerk  this Amorous Absolon
That is for loue alwey so wo bigon
Vp on the Monday  was at Oseneye
With a compaignye  hym to disporte and pleye
And axed vp on cas a Cloistrer
fful priuely  after Iohn the Carpenter
And he drough hym a part out of the chirche
And seyde I noot I saugh hym heere nat wirche
Syn Saterday  I trow that he be went
ffor tymber  ther our Abbot hath hym sent
ffor he is wont for tymber for to go
And dwellen at the grange  a day or two
Or elles  he is at his hous certeyn
Where that he be  I kan nat soothly seyn
 This Absolon  ful ioly was and light
And thoghte  now is tyme wake al nyght
ffor sikirly I saugh him nat stirynge
Aboute his dore  syn day bigan to sprynge
 So moot I thryue  I shal at cokkes crowe
fful pryuely  knokke at his wyndowe
That stant ful lowe  vp on his boures wal
To Alison  now wol I tellen al
My loue longynge  for yet I shal nat mysse
That at the leste wey  I shal hire kisse
Som maner confort shal I haue parfay
My mouth hath icched al this longe day
That is a signe of kissyng atte leste
Al nyght me mette eek  I was at a feeste
Therfore I wol goon slepe  an houre or tweye
And al the nyght thanne wol I wake and pleye


Whan that the firste cok hath crowe anon
Vp rist this ioly louere Absolon
And hym arraieth  gay at poynt deuys
But first he cheweth greyn of lycorys
To smellen sweete  er he hadde kembd his heer
Vnder his tonge  a trewe loue he beer
ffor therby  wende he to ben gracious
He rometh  to the Carpenteres hous
And stille he stant vnder the shot wyndowe
Vn to his brist it raughte  it was so lowe
And softe he knokketh  with a semy soun
What do ye hony comb  sweete Alisoun
My faire bryd  my sweete cynamome
Awaketh lemman myn  and speketh to me
Wel litel thynken ye  vp on my wo
That for youre loue  I swete ther I go
No wonder is  thogh that I swelte and swete  
I moorne  as dooth a lamb after the tete
Ywis lemman  I haue swich loue longynge
That lik a turtel trewe  is my moornynge
I may nat ete  na moore than a mayde
 Go fro the wyndow  Iakke fool she sayde
As help me god  it wol nat be com pa me
I loue another  and elles I were to blame
Wel bet than thee  by Ihesu Absolon
Go forth thy wey  or I wol caste a ston
And lat me slepe  a twenty deuel wey
 Allas quod Absolon  and weylawey
That trewe loue  was euere so yuel biset
Thanne kys me  syn it may be no bet
ffor Ihesus loue  and for the loue of me
 Wiltow thanne  go thy wey quod she
 Ye certes lemman  quod this Absolon
 Thanne make thee redy quod she I come anon
And vn to Nicholas  she seyde stille
Now hust and thou shalt laughen al thy fille
 This Absolon  doun sette hym on his knees


And seyde  I am lord at alle degrees
ffor after this  I hope ther cometh moore
Lemman thy grace  and sweete bryd thyn oore
 The wyndow  she vndoth  and that in haste
Haue do quod she  com of and speed the faste
Lest that oure Neighebores  thee espie
 This Absolon  gan wype his mouth ful drie
Dirk was the nyght as pich  or as the cole
And at the wyndow  out she pitte hir hole
And Absolon  hym fil no bet ne wers
But with his mouth  he kiste hir naked ers
fful sauourly  er he was war of this
 Abak he stirte  and thoughte it was amys
ffor wel he wiste  a womman hath no berd
He felte a thyng al rough  and long yherd
And seyde  fy allas what haue I do
 Tehee quod she  and clapte the wyndow to
And Absolon  gooth forth a sory pas
 A berd a berd  quod hende Nicholas
By goddes corpus  this goth faire and weel
 This sely Absolon  herde euery deel
And on his lippe  he gan for Anger byte
And to hym self  he seyde l shal thee quyte
 Who rubbeth now  who froteth now his lippes
With dust with sond  with straw  with clooth  with chippes
But Absolon  that seith ful ofte allas
My soule  bitake I vn to Sathanas
But me were leuere  than al this toun quod he  
Of this despit awroken for to be
Allas quod he  allas I ne hadde ybleynt
His hoote loue  was coold and al yqueynt
ffor fro that tyme  that he hadde kiste hir ers
Of paramours  he sette nat a kers
ffor he was  heeled of his maladie
fful ofte  paramours he gan deffie
And weepe  as dooth a child that is ybete
A softe paas  he wente ouer the strete


Vn til a smyth  men cleped daun Gerueys
That in his forge  smythed plough harneys
He sharpeth shaar  and kultour bisily
This Absolon  knokketh al esily
And seyde  vndo Gerueys  and that anon
 What who artow I am heere Absolon
What Absolon  for Cristes swete tree
Why rise ye so rathe  ey benedicitee
What eyleth yow  som gay gerl god it woot
Hath broght yow thus  vp on the viritoot
By seinte note  ye woot wel what I mene
 This Absolon  ne roghte nat a bene
Of al his pley  no word agayn he yaf
He hadde  moore tow  on his distaf
Than Gerueys knew  and seyde freend so deere
That hoote kultour  in the chymenee heere
As lene it me  I haue therwith to doone
And I wol  brynge it thee  agayn ful soone
 Gerueys answerde  certes were it gold
Or in a poke  nobles alle vntold
Thou sholdest have  as I am trewe smyth
Ey cristes foo  what wol ye do therwith
 Ther of quod Absolon  be as be may
I shal wel telle it thee  to morwe day
And caughte the kultour  by the colde stele
fful softe  out at the dore he gan to stele
And wente  vn to the Carpenteris wal
He cogheth first  and knokketh ther with al
Vp on the wyndowe  right as he dide er
 This Alison answerde  Who is ther
That knokketh so  I warante it a theef
 Why nay quod he  god woot my sweete leef
I am thyn Absolon  my deerelyng
Of gold quod he  I haue thee broght a ryng
My mooder yaf it me  so god me saue
fful fyn it is  and therto wel ygraue


This wol I yeue thee  if thou me kisse
 This Nicholas  was risen for to pisse
And thoughte  he wolde amenden al the Iape  
He sholde kisse his  er that he scape
And vp the wyndowe  dide he hastily
And out his ers  he putteth pryuely
Ouer the buttok  to the haunche bon
And ther with  spak this clerk this Absolon
Spek sweete bryd  I noot nat where thou art
 This Nicholas  anon leet fle a fart
As greet as it had been a thonder dent
That with the strook he was almoost yblent
And he was redy  with his Iren hoot
And Nicholas  amydde ers he smoot
 Of gooth the skyn  an hande brede aboute
The hoote kultour  brende so his toute
And for the smert he wende for to dye
As he were wood  for wo he gan to crye
Help  water  water  help for goddes herte
 This Carpenter  out of his slomber sterte
And herde oon crien water  as he were wood
And thoughte  Allas  now comth Nowelis flood
He sit hym vp  withouten wordes mo
And with his Ax  he smoot the corde atwo
And doun gooth al  he foond neither to selle
Ne breed ne Ale  til he cam to the Celle
Vp on the floor  and ther aswowne he lay
 Vp stirte hire  Alison and Nicholay
And criden  out and harrow in the strete
The neighebores  bothe smale and grete
In ronnen  for to gauren on this man
That yet aswowne he lay  bothe pale and wan
ffor with the fal  he brosten hadde his Arm
But stonde he moste  vn to his owene harm
ffor whan he spak  he was anon bore doun
With hende Nicholas  and Alisoun


They tolden euery man  that he was wood
He was agast so  of Nowelis flood
Thurgh fantasie  that of his vanytee
He hadde yboght hym  knedyng tubbes thre
And hadde hem hanged  in the roue aboue
And þat he preyde hem  for goddes loue
To sitten in the roof  par compaignye
 The folk gan laughen  at his fantasye
In to the roof  they kiken and they cape
And turned al his harm  vn to a Iape
ffor  what so  þat this Carpenter answerde
It was for noght no man his reson herde
With othes grete  he was so sworn adoun
That he was holde wood in al the toun
ffor euery clerk  anonright  heeld with oother  
They seyde  the man was wood  my leeue broother
And euery wight  gan laughen of this stryf
Thus  swyued was  this Carpenteris wyf
ffor al his kepyng and his Ialousye
And Absolon  hath kist hir nether eye
And Nicholas  is scalded in the towte
This tale is doon  and god saue al the rowte
WHAN folk hadde laughen  at this nyce cas
Of Absolon  and hende Nicholas
Diuerse folk  diuersely they seyde
But for the moore part they loughe and pleyde
Ne at this tale  I saugh no man hym greue
But it were oonly  Osewold the Reue
Bycause  he was  of Carpenteris craft
A litel Ire  in his herte ylaft
He gan to grucche  and blamed it a lite
 So theek  quod he  ful wel koude I yow quite
With bleryng of a proud Milleres eye
If that me liste  speke of ribaudye
But ik am oold  me list no pley for Age
Gras tyme is doon  my fodder is now forage
This white tope  writeth myne olde yeris
Myn herte is mowled also as myne heris
But if I fare  as dooth an Openers
 That ilke fruyt  is euer leng the wers
Til it be roten  in Mullok or in stree
We olde men  I drede so fare we
Til we be roten  kan we nat be rype
We hoppen ay  whil that the world wol pype
ffor in oure wyl  ther stiketh euere a nayl
To haue an hoor heed  and a grene tayl
As hath a leek  for thogh oure myght be goon
Oure wyl  desireth folie euere in oon
ffor whan we may nat doon  than wol we speke
Yet in oure Asshen olde  is fyr yreke
 ffoure gleedes han we  whiche I shal deuyse
Avauntyng liyng Anger  Coueitise
Thise foure sparkles  longen vn to eelde
Oure olde lemes  mowe wel been vnweelde


But wyl ne shal nat faillen  that is sooth  
And yet ik haue alwey a Coltes tooth
As many a yeer  as it is passed henne
Syn that my tappe of lif  bigan to renne
ffor sikerly  whan I was bore  anon
Deeth drough the tappe of lyf  and leet it gon
And euer sithe  hath so the tappe yronne
Til that almoost al empty is the tonne
The streem of lyf  now droppeth on the chymbe
The sely tonge  may wel rynge and chymbe
Of wrecchednesse  that passed is ful yoore
With olde folk saue dotage is namoore
Whan that oure hoost  hadde herd this sermonyng
He gan to speke  as lordly as a kyng
He seide  what amounteth al this wit
What shul we speke alday of hooly writ
The deuel  made a Reue for to preche
And of a Soutere  Shipman or a leche
Sey forth thy tale  and tarie nat the tyme
Lo Depeford  and it is half wey pryme
Lo Grenewych  ther many a shrewe is Inne
It were al tyme  thy tale to bigynne
NOw sires  quod this Osewold the Reue
I pray yow alle  that ye nat yow greue
Thogh I answere  and somdeel sette his howue
ffor leueful is  with force force of showue
 This dronke Millere hath ytoold vs heer
How that bigyled was a Carpenteer
Perauenture in scorn  for I am oon
And by youre leue  I shal him quite anoon
Right in his cherles termes wol I speke
I pray to god  his nekke mote breke
He kan wel  in myn eye seen a stalke
But in his owene  he kan nat seen a balke

AT Trumpyngton  nat fer fro Cantebrigge
Ther gooth a brook  and ouer that a brigge
Vp on the which brook  ther stant a Melle
And this is verray sooth  þat I yow telle
A Millere  was ther dwellynge many a day
As eny pecok he was proud and gay
Pipen he koude and fisshe  and nettes beete
And turne coppes  and wel wrastle and sheete
And by his belt he baar a long panade
And of a swerd  ful trenchant was the blade
A ioly poppere  baar he in his pouche  
Ther was no man  for peril  dorste hym touche
A Sheffeld thwitel  baar he in his hose
Round was his face  and camuse was his nose
As piled as an Ape  was his skulle
He was a Market betere atte fulle
Ther dorste no wight  hand vp on hym legge
That he ne swoor  he sholde anon abegge
A theef he was  of corn and eek of Mele
And that a sly  and vsaunt for to stele
His name was hoote  deynous Symkyn
A wyf he hadde  ycomen of noble kyn
The person of the toun  hir fader was
With hire he yaf  ful many a panne of bras
ffor that Symkyn  sholde in his blood allye
She was yfostred in a Nonnerye
ffor Symkyn  wolde no wyf  as he sayde
But if she were  wel ynorissed and a mayde
To sauen his estaat of yomanrye
And she was proud  and peert as is a pye
A ful fair sighte  was it vp on hem two
On haly dayes  biforn hire wolde he go


With his typet  bounde about his heed
And she cam after  in a gyte of reed
And Symkyn  hadde hosen of the same
Ther dorste no wight  clepen hire but dame
Was noon so hardy  that wente by the weye
That with hire  dorste rage  or ones pleye
But if  he wolde be slayn of Symkyn
With panade  or with knyf  or boidekyn
ffor Ialous folk  ben perilous eueremo
Algate  they wolde hire wyues wenden so
And eek  for she was somdel smoterlich
She was as digne  as water in a dich
As ful of hoker  and of bismare
Hir thoughte  þat a lady sholde hire spare
What for hire kynrede  and hir nortelrie
That she hadde lerned in the Nonnerie
 A doghter hadde they bitwixe hem two
Of twenty yeer  withouten any mo
Sauynge a child  þat was of half yeer age
In Cradel it lay  and was a propre page
This wenche thikke  and wel ygrowen was
With kamuse nose  and eyen greye as glas
Buttokes brode  and brestes rounde and hye
But right fair was hire heer  I wol nat lye
 This person of the toun  for she was feir
In purpos was  to maken hire his heir
Bothe of his catel  and his Mesuage  
And straunge  he made it of hir mariage
His purpos was  for to bistowe hire hye
In to som worthy blood of Auncetrye
ffor hooly chirches good  moot been despended
On hooly chirches blood  that is descended
Therfore  he wolde his hooly blood honoure
Though  that he hooly chirche sholde devoure
Gret sokene  hath this Millere  out of doute
With whete and Malt of al the land aboute


And nameliche  ther was a greet Collegge
Men clepen the Soler halle at Cantebregge
Ther was hir whete  and eek hir malt ygrounde
And on a day  it happed in a stounde
Sik lay the Maunciple  on a maladye
Men wenden wisly  that he sholde dye
ffor which  this Millere  stal bothe mele and corn
An hundred tyme  moore than biforn
ffor ther biforn  he stal but curteisly
But now  he was a theef outrageously
ffor which  the wardeyn chidde and made fare
But ther of  sette the Millere nat a tare
He craketh boost  and swoor it was nat so
 Thanne were ther  yonge poure clerkes two
That dwelten in this halle  of which I seye
Testif they were  and lusty for to pleye
And oonly  for hire myrthe and reuerye
Vp on the wardeyn  bisily they crye
To yeue hem leue  but a litel stounde
To goon to Mille  and seen hir corn ygrounde
And hardily  they dorste leye hir nekke
The Millere shold nat stele hem  half a pekke
Of corn by sleighte  ne by force hem reue
And at the laste  the wardeyn yaf hem leue
Iohn highte that oon  and Aleyn heet that oother
Of o toun were they born  that highte Strother
ffer in the North  I kan nat telle where
 This Aleyn  maketh redy al his gere
And on an hors  the sak he caste anon
fforth goth Aleyn the clerk  and also Iohn
With good swerd  and bokeler by hir side
Iohn knew the wey  hem neded no gyde
And at the Mille  the sak adoun he layth
Aleyn spak first  al hayl Symond yfayth
Hou fares thy faire doghter  and thy wyf
 Aleyn welcome quod Symkyn  by my lyf


And Iohn also  how now  what do ye heer
 Symond quod Iohn  by god nede has na peer
Hym boes serue hym selne  that has na swayn  
Or elles  he is a fool  as clerkes sayn
Oure Manciple  I hope  he wil be deed
Swa werkes ay  the wanges in his heed
And forthy  is I come  and eek Alayn
To grynde oure corn  and carie it ham agayn
I pray yow  spede vs heythen that ye may
 It shal be doon  quod Symkyn by my fay
What wol ye doon  whil that it is in hande
 By God  right by the hopur wil I stande
Quod Iohn  and se  how that the corn gas In
Yet saugh I neuere  by my fader kyn
How that the hopur  wagges til and fra
 Aleyn answerde  Iohn wiltow swa
Thanne wil I be bynethe  by my croun
And se  how þat the Mele falles doun
In to the trough  that sal be my disport
ffor Iohn yfaith  I may been of youre sort
I is  as ille a Millere  as are ye
 This Millere  smyled of hir nycetee
And thoghte  al this nys doon  but for a wyle
They wene  þat no man may hem bigile
But by my thrift  yet shal I blere hir eye
ffor al the sleighte  in hir Philosophye
The moore queynte crekes  that they make
The moore wol I stele  whan I take
In stide of flour  yet wol I yeue hem bren
The gretteste clerkes  been noght wisest men
As whilom to the wolf  thus spak the Mare
Of al hir Art  counte I noght a tare
 Out at the dore  he gooth ful pryuely
Whan þat he saugh  his tyme softely
He looketh vp and doun  til he hath founde
The clerkes hors  ther as it stood ybounde


Bihynde the Mille  vnder a lefsel
And to the hors  he goth hym faire and wel
He strepeth of the brydel  right anon
And whan the hors was laus  he gynneth gon
Toward the fen  ther wilde Mares renne
fforth with wehee  thurgh thikke and thurgh thenne
 This Millere gooth agayn  no word he seyde
But dooth his note  and with the clerkes pleyde
Til that hir corn  was faire and weel ygrounde
And whan the Mele  is sakked and ybounde
This Iohn goth out and fynt his hors away
And gan to crie  harrow and weylaway
Oure hors is lorn  Alayn for goddes banes
Stepe on thy feet com out man al atanes
Allas  our wardeyn  has his palfrey lorn  
This Aleyn al forgat  bothe Mele and corn
Al was out of his mynde  his housbondrie
What whilk way is he geen  he gan to crie
 The wyf cam lepynge Inward with a ren
She seyde allas  youre hors goth to the fen
With wilde mares  as faste as he may go
Vnthank come on his hand  that boond hym so
And he þat bettre  sholde han knyt the reyne
 Allas quod Aleyn  for cristes peyne
Lay doun thy swerd  and I wil myn alswa
I is ful wight god waat as is a raa
By god herte  he sal nat scape vs bathe
Why nadstow pit the Capul in the lathe
Ilhayl  by god Aleyn  thou is a fonne
 This sely clerkes  han ful faste yronne
Toward the fen  bothe Aleyn and eek Iohn
 And whan the Millere  saugh þat they were gon
He half a busshel  of hir flour hath take
And bad his wyf  go knede it in  cake
He seyde  I trowe the clerkes were aferd
Yet kan a Millere  make a clerkes berd


ffor al his Art now lat hem goon hir weye
Lo wher they goon  ye lat the children pleye
They gete hym nat so lightly  by my croun
 Thise sely clerkes  rennen vp and doun
With keepe  keepe  stand  stand  Iossa warderere
Ga whistle thou  and I shal kepe hym heere
But shortly  til that it was verray nyght
They koude nat  though they do al hir myght
Hir capul cacche  he ran alwey so faste
Til in a dych  they caughte hym atte laste
Wery and weet as beest is in the reyn
Comth sely Iohn  and with him comth Aleyn
Allas quod Iohn  the day that I was born
Now are we dryue  til hethyng and til scorn
Oure corn is stoln  me wil vs fooles calle
Bathe the wardeyn  and oure felawes alle
And namely  the Millere weylaway
 Thus pleyneth Iohn  as he gooth by the way
Toward the Mille  and bayard in his hond
The Millere  sittynge  by the fyr he fond
ffor it was nyght and forther myghte they noght
But for the loue of god  they hym bisoght
Of herberwe and of ese  as for hir peny
 The Millere seyde agayn  if ther be eny
Swich as it is  yet shal ye haue youre part
Myn hous is streit but ye han lerned Art
Ye konne by Argumentz  make a place  
A myle brood  of twenty foot of space
Lat se now  if this place may suffise
Or make it rowm with speche  as in youre gise
Now Symond  seyde Iohn  by seint Cutberd
Ay is thou myrie  and this is faire answerd
I haue herd seyd  man sal taa  of twa thynges
Slyk as he fyndes  or taa slyk as he brynges
But specially  I pray thee hoost deere
Get vs som mete and drynke  and make vs cheere


And we wil payen  trewely atte fulle
With empty hand  men may none haukes tulle
Loo heere our siluer  redy for to spende
 This Millere  in to toun his doghter sende
ffor Ale and breed  and rosted hem a goos
And boond hire hors  it sholde nat goon loos
And in his owene chambre  hem made a bed
With sheetes and with chalons  faire yspred
Noght from his owene bed  ten foot  or twelue
His doghter hadde a bed  al by hir selue
Right in the same chambre  by and by
It myghte be no bet and cause why
Ther was no rommer herberwe in the place
They soupen  and they speke hem to solace
And drynke euere  strong ale atte beste
Aboute mydnyght wente they to reste
 Wel hath this Millere vernysshed his heed
fful pale he was fordronken  and nat reed
He yexeth  and he speketh  thurgh the nose
As he were  on the quakke  or on the pose
To bedde he goth  and with hym goth his wyf
As any Iay  she light was and Iolyf
So was hir ioly whistle wel ywet
The Cradel  at hir beddes feet is set
To rokken  and to yeue the child to sowke
And whan þat dronken  al was in the crowke
To bedde  went the doghter right anon
To bedde wente Aleyn  and also Iohn
Ther nas na moore  hem neded no dwale
This Millere  hath so wisely bibbed Ale
That as an hors  he snorteth in his sleepe
Ne of his tayl bihynde  he took no keepe
His wyf bar him a burdon a ful strong
Men myghte hir rowtyng heere two furlong
The wenche rowteth eek  par compaignye
 Aleyn the clerk  that herd this melodye


He poked Iohn  and seyde slepestow
Herdtow euere slyk  a sang er now
Lo whilk a cowplyng is ymel hem alle  
A wilde fyr  vp on thair bodyes falle
Wha herkned euere  slyk a ferly thyng
Ye they sal haue  the flour of il endyng
This lange nyght  ther tydes me na reste
But yet nafors  al sal be for the beste
ffor Iohn seyde he  als euere moot I thryue
If þat I may  yon wenche wil I swyue
Som esement has lawe yshapen vs
ffor Iohn  ther is a lawe  that says thus
That gif a man  in a point be ygreued
That in another  he sal be releued
Oure corn is stoln  shortly is ne nay
And we han had  an il fit al this day
And syn I sal haue neen amendement
Agayn my los  I wil haue esement
By God sale  it sal neen other bee
 This Iohn answerde  Alayn auyse thee
The Millere  is a perilous man he seyde
And gif that he  out of his sleepe abreyde
He myghte doon vs  bathe a vileynye
 Aleyn answerde  I count hym nat a flye
And vp he rist  and by the wenche he crepte
This wenche lay vprighte  and faste slepte
Til he so ny was  er she myghte espie
That it had been  to late for to crie
And shortly for to seyn  they were aton
Now pley Aleyn  for I wol speke of Iohn
This Iohn lith stille  a furlong wey or two
And to hym self  he maketh routhe and wo
Allas quod he  this is a wikked Iape
Now may I seyn  that I is but an Ape
Yet has my felawe  som what for his harm
He has  the Milleris doghter  in his Arm


He auntred hym  and has his nedes sped
And I lye  as a draf sek  in my bed
And when this Iape is tald another day
I sal been halde a daf a cokenay
I wil arise  and auntre it by my fayth
Vnhardy is vnseely  thus men sayth
And vp he roos  and softely he wente
Vn to the cradel  and in his hand it hente
And baar it softe  vn to the beddes feet
 Soone after this  the wyf hir rowtyng leet
And gan awake  and wente hire out to pisse
And cam agayn  and gan hir cradel mysse
And groped heer and ther  but she foond noon
Allas quod she  I hadde almoost mysgoon
I hadde almoost goon  to the clerkes bed  
Ey benedicite  thanne hadde I foule ysped
And forth she gooth  til she the Cradel fond
She gropeth  alwey forther with hir hond
And foond the bed  and thoghte noght but good
By cause  that the Cradel by it stood
And nyste wher she was  for it was derk
But faire and wel  she creepe In to the clerk
And lith ful stille  and wolde han caught a sleepe
WithInne a while  this Iohn the clerk vp leepe
And on this goode wyf  he leith on soore
So myrie a fit hadde she nat ful yoore
He priketh harde and soore  as he were mad
This ioly lyf  han thise two clerkes lad
Til that the thridde cok  bigan to synge
 Aleyn wax wery  in the dawenynge
ffor he had swonken  al the longe nyght
And seyde  fare weel Malyne sweete wight
The day is come  I may no lenger byde
But eueremo  wher so I go  or ryde
I is thyn awen clerk swa haue I seel
 Now deere lemman quod she  go fareweel


But er thow go  o thyng I wol thee telle
Whan that thou wendest homward by the Melle
Right at the entree  of the dore bihynde
Thou shalt a Cake  of half a busshel fynde
That was ymaked  of thyn owene mele
Which that I heelpe  my fader for to stele
And goode lemman  god thee saue and kepe
And with that word  almoost she gan to wepe
Aleyn vp rist  and thoughte  er þat it dawe
I wol go crepen In  by my felawe
And fond the Cradel  with his hand anon
By God thoughte he  al wrang I haue mysgon
Myn heed is toty  of my swynk to nyght
That maketh me  that I go nat aright
I woot wel by the Cradel  I have mysgo
Heere lith the Millere  and his wyf also
And forth he goth  a twenty deuel way
Vn to the bed  ther as the Millere lay
He wende have cropen  by his felawe Iohn
And by the Millere In he creepe anon
And caughte hym by the nekke  and softe he spak
He seyde  thou Iohn  thou swynesheed awak
ffor cristes saule  and heer a noble game
ffor by that lord  that called is seint Iame
As I haue thries  in this shorte nyght
Swyued the Milleres doghter bolt vpright
Whil thow hast as a Coward been agast  
 Ye false harlot quod the Millere hast
A false traitour  false clerk  quod he
Thow shalt be deed  by goddes dignitee
Who dorste be so boold  to disparage
My doghter  that is come  of swich lynage
And by the throte bolle  he caughte Alayn
And he hente hym  despitously agayn
And on the nose  he smoot hym with his fest
Doun ran the blody streem  vp on his brest


And in the floor  with nose and mouth tobroke
They walwe  as doon two pigges in a poke
And vp they goon  and doun agayn anon
Til that the Millere  sporned at a stoon
And doun he fil  bakward vp on his wyf
That wiste no thyng  of this nyce stryf
ffor she was falle aslepe a lite wight
With Iohn the clerk  that waked hadde al nyght
And with the fal  out of hir sleepe she breyde
Help hooly croys of Bromholm  she seyde
In manus tuas  lord to thee I calle
Awak Symond  the feend is on vs falle
Myn herte is broken  help I nam but deed
Ther lyth oon  vp on my wombe  and on myn heed
Helpe Symkyn  for the false clerkes fighte
 This Iohn stirte vp  as soone as euer he myghte
And graspeth by the walles to and fro
To fynde a staf  and she stirte vp also
And knewe the Estres  bet than dide this Iohn
And by the wal  a staf she foond anon
And saugh  a litel shymeryng of a light
ffor at an hole  In shoon the moone bright
And by that light she saugh hem bothe two
But sikerly  she nyste  who was who
But as she saugh  a whit thyng in hir eye
And whan she gan  the white thyng espye
She wende the clerk hadde wered a volupeer
And with the staf  she drough ay neer and neer
And wende han hit this Aleyn at the fulle
And smoot the Millere  on the pyled skulle
And doun he gooth  and cride harrow I dye
Thise clerkes beete hym weel  and lete hym lye
And greythen hem  and tooke hir hors anon
And eek hire mele  and on hir wey they gon
And at the Mille  yet they tooke hir cake
Of half a busshel flour  ful wel ybake


Thus is the proude Millere wel ybete
And hath ylost  the gryndynge of the whete
And payed for the soper euerideel  
Of Aleyn and of Iohn  þat bette hym weel
His wyf is swyued  and his doghter als
Lo swich it is  a Millere to be fals
And therfore this prouerbe  is seyd ful sooth
Hym thar nat wene wel  that yuele dooth
A gylour  shal hym self bigyled be
And god  þat sitteth heighe in Trinitee
Saue al this compaignye  grete and smale
Thus have I quyt the Millere in my tale
The Cook of London  whil that the Reue spak
ffor ioye him thoughte  he clawed him on the bak
Ha  ha  quod he  for cristes passion
This Millere  hadde a sharpe conclusion
Vpon his argument  of herbergage
Wel seyde Salomon  in his langage
Ne brynge nat every man into thyn hous
ffor herberwynge by nyghte is perilous
Wel oghte a man  auysed for to be
Whom that he broghte  into his pryuetee
I pray to god  so yeue me sorwe and care
If euere sitthe  I highte Hogge of Ware
Herde I a Millere  bettre yset a werk
He hadde a Iape of malice in the derk
But god forbede  that we stynte heere
And therfore  if ye vouchesauf to heere
A tale of me  that am a poure man
I wol yow telle  as wel as euere I kan
A litel iape  that fil in oure Citee
 Oure hoost answerde  and seide I graunte it thee
Now telle on Roger  looke that it be good
ffor many a pastee  hastow laten blood
And many a Iakke of Douere hastow soold
That hath been  twies hoot and twies coold
Of many a pilgrym  hastow cristes curs
ffor of thy percely  yet they fare the wors
That they han eten  with thy stubbel goos
ffor in thy shoppe  is many a flye loos
Now telle on  gentil Roger by thy name
But yet I pray thee  be nat wroth for game
A man may seye ful sooth  in game and pley  
 Thou seist ful sooth  quod Roger by my fey


But sooth pley quaad pley  as the flemyng seith
And therfore  Herry Bailly  by thy feith
Be thou na wrooth  er we departen heer
Though that my tale  be of an Hostileer
But nathelees  I wol nat telle it yit
But er we parte  ywis thou shalt be quit
And ther with al  he lough and made cheere
And seyde his tale  as ye shul after heere
APrentys whilom dwelled  in oure Citee
And of a craft of vitailliers was hee
Gaillard he was  as Goldfynch in the shawe
Broun as a berye  a propre short felwe
With lokkes blake  ykempd ful fetisly
Dauncen he koude  so wel and iolily
That he was cleped Perkyn Reuelour
He was  as ful of loue and paramour
As is the hyve  ful of hony sweete
Wel was the wenche  with hym myghte meete
At euery bridale  wolde he synge and hoppe
He loved bet the Tauerne than the shoppe
 ffor  whan ther  any ridyng was in Chepe
Out of the shoppe  thider wolde he lepe
Til that he hadde  al the sighte yseyn
And daunced wel  he wolde nat come ayeyn
And gadered hym  a meynee of his sort
To hoppe and synge  and maken swich disport
And ther  they setten steuene for to meete
To pleyen  at the dys in swich a streete
ffor in the toun  nas ther no prentys
That fairer koude caste  a paire of dys
Than Perkyn koude  and therto he was free
Of his dispense  in place of pryuetee
That fond his maister wel in his chaffare
ffor often tyme  he foond his box ful bare
ffor sikerly  a prentys Reuelour
That haunteth dys  Riot or paramour
His maister  shal it in his shoppe abye
Al haue he  no part of the Mynstralcye
ffor thefte and Riot they been conuertible
Al konne he pleye on gyterne  or Ribible


Reuel and trouthe  as in a lowe degree  
They been ful wrothe al day  as men may see
 This ioly prentys  with his maister bood
Til he were ny  out of his prentishood
Al were he snybbed  bothe erly and late
And somtyme  lad with reuel to Newegate
But atte laste  his maister hym bithoghte
Vp on a day  whan he his papir soghte
Of a prouerbe  that seith this same word
Wel bet is roten Appul  out of hoord
Than þat  it rotie al the remenaunt
 So fareth it by a riotous seruaunt
It is wel lasse harm  to lete hym pace
Than he shende  alle the seruantz in the place
Therfore  his maister  yaf hym Acquitance
And bad hym go  with sorwe and with meschance
And thus this ioly prentys  hadde his leue
Now lat hym riote al the nyght  or leue
And for ther is no theef  withoute a lowke
That helpeth hym  to wasten and to sowke
Of that he brybe kan  or borwe may
Anon he sente his bed  and his array
Vn to a compier  of his owene 
That louede dys  and Reuel and disport
And hadde a wyf  that heeld for contenance
A shoppe  and swyued for hir sustenance
Ovre hoost saugh wel  that the brighte sonne
The ark of his artificial day hath ronne
The ferthe part and half an houre and moore
And though  he were nat depe ystert in loore
He wiste  it was the eighte and twentithe day
Of Aprill  that is messager to May
And saugh wel  that the shadwe of euery tree
Was as in lengthe  the same quantitee
That was the body erect that caused it
And ther fore  by the shadwe  he took his wit
That Phebus  which þat shoon  so clere and brighte
Degrees  was fyue and fourty clombe on highte
And for that day  as in that latitude
It was ten at the clokke  he gan conclude
And sodeynly  he plighte his hors aboute
 Lordynges quod he  I warne yow al this route
The fourthe party of this day is gon
Now for the loue of god  and of Seint Iohn
Leseth no tyme  as ferforth as ye may
Lordynges  the tyme wasteth nyght and day
And steleth from vs  what pryuely slepynge
And what thurgh necligence  in oure wakynge
As dooth the streem  that turneth neuere agayn
Descendynge fro the montaigne in to playn
 Wel kan Senec and many a philosophre
Biwaillen tyme  moore than gold in cofre
ffor losse of catel  may recouered be
But losse of tyme  shendeth vs quod he


It wol nat come agayn  with outen drede
Namoore  than wole Malkynes maydenhede
Whan she hath lost it in hir wantownesse
Lat us nat mowlen thus in ydelnesse
 Sire man of lawe quod he  so haue ye blis
Telle vs a tale anon  as forward is
Ye been submytted  thurgh youre free assent
To stonden in this cas  at my Iuggement
Acquiteth yow now  of youre biheeste
Thanne haue ye do youre deuoir atte leeste
 Hoost quod he  depardieux ich assente
To breke forward  is nat myn entente
Biheste is dette  and I wole holde fayn
Al my biheste  I kan no bettre sayn
ffor swich lawe  as a man yeueth another wight  
He sholde hym seluen  vsen it by right
Thus wole oure text but nathelees certeyn
I kan right now  no thrifty tale seyn
That Chaucer  thogh he kan but lewedly
On metres  and on rymyng craftily
Hath seyd hem  in swich englissh  as he kan
Of olde tyme  as knoweth many a man
And if he haue noght seyd hem leue brother
In o book  he hath seyd hem in another
ffor he hath toold  of loueris vp and doun 
Mo than Ouide  made of mencioun
In hise epistles  that been ful olde
What sholde I telle hem  syn they ben tolde
 In youthe  he made  of Ceys and Alcione
And sitthe  hath he spoken of euerichone
Thise noble wyues  and thise loueris eke
Who so that wole  his large volume seke
Cleped  the seintes legende of Cupide
Ther may he seen  the large woundes wyde
Of Lucresse  and of Babilan Tesbee
The swerd of Dido  for the false Enee


The tree of Phillis  for hire Demophon
The pleinte of Diane  and of Hermyon
Of Adriane  and of Isiphilee
The bareyne yle  stondynge in the see
The dreynte Leandre  for his Erro
The teeris of Eleyne  and the wo
Of Brixseyde  and the Ladomya
The crueltee  of the queene Medea
Thy litel children  hangynge by the hals
ffor thy Iason  that was in loue so fals
O Ypermystra  Penolopee  Alceste
Youre wifhede  he comendeth with the beste
 But certeinly no word ne writeth he
Of thilke wikke ensample of Canacee
That loued  hir owene brother synfully
Of swiche cursed stories  I sey fy
Or ellis  of Tyro Appollonius
How that the cursed kyng  Antiochus
Birafte his doghter  of hir maydenhede
That is  so horrible a tale for to rede
Whan he hir threw  vp on the pauement
And therfore he  of ful auysement
Nolde neuere write  in none of his sermons
Of swiche  vnkynde abhomynacions
Ne I wol noon reherce  if that I may
 But of my tale  how shall I doon this day
Me were looth  be likned doutelees  
To Muses  that men clepe Pierides
Methamorphosios  woot what I mene
But nathelees  I recche noght a bene
Though I come after hym  with hawebake
I speke in prose  and lat him rymes make
And with that word  he with a sobre cheere
Bigan his tale  as ye shal after heere

Ohateful harm  condicion of pouerte
With thurst with coold  with hunger so confoundid
To asken help  thee shameth in thyn herte
If thou noon aske  so soore artow ywoundid
That verray nede  vnwrappeth al thy wounde hid
Maugree thyn heed  thou most for Indigence
Or stele  or begge  or borwe thy despence
Thow blamest crist and seist ful bitterly
He mysdeparteth  richesse temporal
Thy neighebore  thou wytest synfully
And seist thou hast to lite  and he hath al
Parfay seistow  somtyme he rekene shal
Whan that his tayl  shal brennen in the gleede
ffor he noght helpeth  needfulle  in hir neede
 Herke  what is the sentence of the wise
Bet is to dyen  than haue Indigence
Thy selue neighebor  wol thee despise
If thou be poure  farwel thy reuerence
Yet of the wise man  take this sentence
Alle dayes of poure men been wikke
Be war therfore  er thou come to that prikke
If thou be poure  thy brother hateth thee
And alle thy freendes  fleen from thee allas
O riche marchauntz  ful of wele been yee
O noble  o prudent folk  as in this cas
Youre bagges  been nat fild with ambes as
But with sys cynk  that renneth for youre chaunce
At Cristemasse  myrie may ye daunce


Ye seken lond and see  for yowre wynnynges  
As wise folk ye knowen all thestaat
Of regnes  ye been fadres of tidynges
And tales  bothe of pees  and of debaat
I were right now  of tales desolaat
Nere that a Marchant goon is many a yeere
Me taughte a tale  which that ye shal heere

IN Surrye whilom dwelte a compaignye
Of chapmen riche  and therto sadde and trewe
That wyde where  senten hir spicerye
Clothes of gold  and satyns riche of hewe
Hir chaffare  was so thrifty and so newe
That euery wight  hath deyntee to chaffare
With hem  and eek  to sellen hem hire ware
Now fil it that the maistres  of that sort
Han shapen hem  to Rome for to wende
Were it for chapmanhode  or for disport
Noon oother message  wolde they thider sende
But comen hem self to Rome  this is the ende
And in swich place  as thoughte hem auantage
ffor hire entente  they take hir herbergage
 Soiourned han thise Marchantz  in that toun
A certein tyme  as fil to hire plesance
And so bifel  that thexcellent renoun
Of the Emperours doghter  Dame Custance
Reported was  with euery circumstance
Vn to thise Surryen Marchantz  in swich a wyse
ffro day to day  as I shal yow deuyse
 This was the commune voys of every man
Oure Emperour of Rome  god hym see
A doghter hath  that syn the world bigan
To rekene as wel  hir goodnesse as beautee
Nas neuere  swich another as is shee
I prey to god  in honour hire susteene
And wolde she were  of all Europe the queene

In hire  is heigh beautee  with oute pride  
Yowthe  with oute grenehede  or folye
To alle hire werkes  vertu is hir gyde
Humblesse  hath slayn in hire al tirannye
She is Mirour  of alle curteisye
Hir herte  is verray chambre of hoolynesse
Hir hand  Ministre of fredam for almesse
And al this voys was sooth  as god is trewe
But now to purpos  lat vs turne agayn
Thise Marchantz  han doon fraught  hir shippes newe
And whan they han  this blisful mayden sayn
Hoom to Surrye  been they went ful fayn
And doon hir nedes  as they han doon yoore
And lyuen in wele  I kan sey yow namoore
 Now fil it that thise Marchantz  stode in grace
Of hym  that was the Sowdan of Surrye
ffor whan they cam  from any strange place
He wolde  of his benigne curteisye
Make hem good chiere  and bisily espye
Tidynges  of sondry regnes for to leere
The wondres  that they myghte seen or heere
Amonges othere thynges specially
Thise Marchantz  han hym toold  of dame Custance
So greet noblesse  in ernest ceriously
That this Sowdan  hath caught so greet plesance
To han hir figure  in his remembrance
That all his lust and al his bisy cure
Was for to loue hire  while his lyf may dure
Parauenture  in thilke large book
Which þat men clipe the heuene  ywriten was
With sterres  whan that he his birthe took
That he for loue  sholde han his deeth allas


For in the sterres  clerer than is glas
Is writen god woot who so koude it rede
The deeth of euery man  withouten drede
In sterres many a wynter  ther biforn
Was writen the deeth  of Ector  Achilles
Of Pompei Iulius  er they were born
The strif of Thebes  and of Ercules
Of Sampson  Turnus  and of Socrates
The deeth  but mennes wittes ben so dulle
That no wight kan wel rede it atte fulle
 This Sowdan  for his priuee conseil sente  
And shortly  of this matiere for to pace
He hath to hem  declared his entente
And seyde hem certein  but he myghte haue grace
To han Custance  withInne a litel space
He nas but deed  and charged hem in hye
To shapen for his lyf  som remedye
 Diuerse men  diuerse thynges seyden
They argumenten  casten vp and doun
Many a subtil resoun  forth they leyden
They speken of  Magyk and Abusion
But finally  as in conclusion
They kan nat seen  in that noon auantag
Ne in noon oother wey saue mariage
Thanne sawe they therInne swich difficultee
By wey of reson  for to speke al playn
By cause  that ther was swich diuersitee
Bitwene hir bothe lawes  that they sayn
They trowe  þat no cristene prince wolde fayn
Wedden his child  vnder oure lawes sweete
That vs were taught by Mahoun oure prophete


 And he answerde  rather than I lese
Custance I wol be cristned doutelees
I moot been hires  I may noon oother chese
I prey yow  hoold youre argumentz in pees
Saueth my lyf  and beth noght recchelees
To geten hire  that hath my lyf in cure
For in this wo  I may nat longe endure
 What nedeth  gretter dilatacion
I seye  by tretys  and Embassadrie
And by  the popes mediacion
And al the chirche  and al the chiualrie
That in destruccion of Maumettrie
And in encrees  of cristes lawe deere
They been acorded  so as ye shal heere
How that the sowdan  and his Baronage
And alle hise liges  sholde ycristned be
And he shal han  Custance  in mariage
And certein gold  I noot what quantitee
And heer to founden  sufficient suretee
This same accord  was sworn on eyther syde
Now faire Custance  almyghty god thee gyde
 Now wolde som men  waiten as I gesse  
That I sholde tellen  al the purueiance
That themperour  of his grete noblesse
Hath shapen  for his doghter dame Custance
Wel may men knowen  þat so greet ordinance
May no man tellen  in a litel clause
As was arrayed  for so heigh a cause
Bisshopes been shapen  with hire for to wende
Lordes  ladies  knyghtes of renoun
And oother folk ynogh  this is thende
And notified is  thurgh out the toun


That euery wight  with greet deuocioun
Sholde preyen crist that he this mariage
Receyue in gree  and spede this viage
 The day is comen  of hir departynge
I seye  the woful day fatal is come
That ther may be  no lenger tariynge
But forthward they hem dressen  alle and some
Custance  þat was with sorwe al ouercome
fful pale arist and dresseth hire to wende
ffor wel she seeth  ther is noon oother ende
Allas  what wonder is it thogh she wepte
That shal be sent  to strange nacion
ffro freendes þat so tendrely hire kepte
And to be bounden  vnder subieccion
Of oon  she knoweth nat his condicion
Housbondes been alle goode  and han ben yoore
That knowen wyues  I dar say yow na moore
 ffader she seyde  thy wrecched child Custance
Thy yonge doghter  fostred vp so softe
And ye my mooder  my souerayn plesance
Ouer alle thyng out taken crist on lofte
Custance youre child  hire recomandeth ofte
Vn to your grace  for I shal to Surrye
Ne shal I neuere  seen yow moore with eye
Allas  vn to the Barbre nacion
I moste goon  syn that it is youre wille
But crist that starf  for our sauacion
So yeue me grace  hise heestes to fulfille
I wrecche womman  no fors  though I spille
Wommen are born  to thraldom and penance
And to been  vnder mannes gouernance


 I trowe at Troye  whan Pirrus brak  the wal  
Or Ilion  brende Thebes the Citee
Nat Rome  for the harm thurgh Hanybal
That Romayns  hath venquysshed tymes thre
Nas herd  swich tendre wepyng for pitee
As in the chambre was for hire departynge
But forth she moot wher so she wepe or synge
 O firste moeuyng  crueel firmament
With thy diurnal sweigh  that crowdest ay
And hurlest al  from Est til Occident
That naturelly  wolde holde another way
Thy crowdyng  set the heuene in swich array
At the bigynnyng of this fiers viage
That crueel Mars  hath slayn this mariage
Infortunat Ascendent tortuous
Of which  the lord is helplees falle allas
Out of his Angle  in to the derkeste hous
O Mars  o Atazir  as in this cas
O fieble Moone  vnhappy been thy paas
Thou knyttest thee  ther thou art nat receyued
Ther thou were weel  fro thennes artow weyued
Imprudent Emperour  of Rome allas
Was ther  no philosophre  in al thy toun
Is no tyme bet than oother  in swich cas
Of viage  is ther noon eleccion
Namely  to folk  of heigh condicion
Noght whan a roote  is of a burthe yknowe
Allas  we been  to lewed or to slowe
 To ship is come  this woful faire mayde
Solempnely  with euery circumstance
Now Ihesu crist be with yow alle she sayde
Ther nys namoore  but farewel  faire Custance


She peyneth hire  to make good contenance
And forth  I lete hire saille  in this manere
And turne I wole  agayn to my matere
 The mooder  of the Sowdan  welle of vices
Espied hath  hir sones pleyn entente
How he wol lete  hise olde sacrifices
And right anon  she for hir conseil sente
And they been come  to knowe what she mente
And whan assembled was  this folk in feere
She sette hire doun  and seyde as ye shal heere
 Lordes  she seyde  ye knowen euerichon  
How that my sone  in point is for to lete
The hooly lawes  of oure Alkaron
Yeuen by goddes message Makomete
But oon auow  to grete god I heete
The lyf shal rather  out of my body sterte
Than Makometes lawe  out of myn herte
What sholde vs tyden  of this newe lawe
But thraldom to our bodies and penance
And afterward  in helle to be drawe
ffor we reneyed  Mahoun oure creance
But lordes  wol ye maken assurance
As I shal seyn  assentynge to my loore
And I shal make vs sauf for eueremoore
 They sworen  and assenten euery man
To lyue with hire and dye  and by hire stonde
And euerich  in the beste wise he kan
To strengthen hire  shal alle hise frendes fonde
And she hath  this emprise ytake on honde
Which ye shal heren  that I shal deuyse
And to hem alle  she spak right in this wyse


 We shul first feyne vs  cristendom to take
Coold water  shal nat greue vs but a lite
And I shal  swiche a feeste and reuel make
That as I trowe  I shal the Sowdan quite
ffor thogh his wyf  be cristned neuer so white
She shal haue nede  to wasshe awey the rede
Thogh she  a font ful water  with hire lede
O Sowdanesse  roote of Iniquitee
Virago  thou Semyrame the secounde
O serpent  vnder femynynytee
Lik to the serpent depe in helle ybounde
O feyned womman  al that may confounde
Vertu and Innocence  thurgh thy malice
Is bred in thee  as nest of euery vice
O Sathan enuious  syn thilke day
That thou were chaced from oure heritage
Wel knowestow  to wommen the olde way
Thou madest Eua  brynge vs in seruage
Thou wolt fordoon  this cristen mariage
Thyn Instrument so weylawey the while
Makestow of wommen  whan thou wolt bigile
 This Sowdanesse  whom I thus blame and warye  
Leet priuely  hire conseil goon hire way
What sholde I in this tale lenger tarye
She rydeth to the Sowdan  on a day
And seyde hym  that she wolde reneye hir lay
And cristendom  of preestes handes fonge
Repentynge hire  she hethen was so longe
Bisechynge hym  to doon hire that honour
That she moste han  the cristen folk to feeste
To plesen hem I wol do my labour
The Sowdan seith  I wol doon at youre heeste


And knelynge  thanketh hire of that requeste
So glad he was  he nyste what to seye
She kiste hir sone  and hoome she gooth hir weye
Arryued been  this cristen folk to londe
In Surrye  with a greet solempne route
And hastifliche  this Sowdan sente his sonde
ffirst to his mooder  and all the regne aboute
And seyde  his wyf was comen oute of doute
And preyde hire  for to ryde agayn the queene
The honour of his regne  to susteene
Greet was the prees  and riche was tharray
Of Surryens and Romayns met yfeere
The mooder of the Sowdan  riche and gay
Recyueth hire  with also glad a cheere
As any mooder  myghte hir doghter deere
And to the nexte Citee  ther bisyde
A softe paas  solempnely they ryde
 Noght trowe I  the triumphe of Iulius
Of which  that Lucan maketh swich a boost
Was roialler  or moore curius
Than was thassemblee  of this blisful hoost
But this scorpioun  this wikked goost
The Sowdanesse  for all hire flaterynge
Caste vnder this  ful mortally to stynge
 The Sowdan comth hym self soone after this  
So roially  that wonder is to telle
And welcometh hire  with alle ioye and blis
And thus  in murthe and ioye I lete hem dwelle


The fruyt of this matiere  is that I telle
Whan tyme cam  men thoughte it for the beste
The reuel stynte  and men goon to hir reste
 The tyme cam  this olde Sowdanesse
Ordeyned hath this feeste  of which I tolde
And to the feeste  cristen folk hem dresse
In general  ye bothe yonge and olde
Heere may men  feeste  and roialtee bihold
And deyntees mo  than I kan yow deuyse
But all to deere  they boghte it er they ryse
Osodeyn wo  that euere art successour
To worldly blisse  spreynd with bitternesse
The ende of the ioye  of oure worldly labour
Wo occupieth  the fyn of oure gladnesse
Herke this conseil  for thy sikernesse
Vp on thy glade day  haue in thy mynde
The vnwar wo  or harm þat comth bihynde
ffor soothly  for to tellen  at o word
The sowdan  and the cristen everichone
Been al tohewe  and stiked at the bord
But it were oonly  dame Custance allone
This olde Sowdanesse  cursed krone
Hath with hir freendes  doon this cursed dede
ffor she hir self  wolde all the contree lede
Ne was Surryen noon  that was conuerted
That of the conseil  of the Sowdan woot
That he nas al tohewe  er he asterted
And Custance  han they take anon foot hoot
And in a ship  all steerelees god woot
They han hir set and biddeth hire lerne saille
Out of Surrye  agaynward to Ytaille


A certein tresor  that she with hire ladde
And sooth to seyn  vitaille greet plentee
They han hire yeuen  and clothes eek she hadde
And forth she sailleth  in the salte see
O my Custance  ful of benignytee
O Emperours yonge doghter deere
He that is lord of ffortune be thy steere
She blesseth hire  and with ful pitous voys  
Vn to the croys of Crist thus seyde she
O cleere  o woful Auter  hooly croys
Reed of the lambes blood  ful of pitee
That wesshe the world  fro the olde Iniquitee
Me fro the feend  and fro his clawes kepe
That day  that I shal drenchen in the depe
Victorious tree  proteccion of trewe
That oonly  worthy were for to bere
The kyng of heuene  with his woundes newe
The white lamb  þat hurt was with the spere
fflemere of feendes  out of hym and here
On which  thy lymes  feithfully extenden
Me helpe  and yif me myght  my lyf tamenden
 Yeres and dayes  fleteth this creature
Thurghout the See of Grece  vn to the Strayte
Of Marrok as it was hire Auenture
On many a sory meel  now may she bayte
After hir deeth  ful often may she wayte
Er that the wilde wawes  wol hire dryue
Vn to the place  ther she shal arryue
Men myghten asken  why she was nat slayn
Eek at the feeste  who myghte hir body saue
And I answere  to that demande agayn
Who saued danyel  in the horrible Caue


Ther euery wight saue he  maister and knaue
Was with the leon frete  er he asterte
No wight but god  that he bar in his herte
God liste to shewe  his wonderful myracle
In hire  for we sholde seen  his myghty werkis
Crist which that is  to euery harm triacle
By certeine meenes ofte  as knowen clerkis
Dooth thyng for certein ende  that ful derk is
To mannes wit that for oure ignorance
Ne konne noght knowe  his prudent purueiance
 Now sith she was nat  at the feeste yslawe
Who kepte hire  fro the drenchyng  in the see
Who kepte Ionas  in the fisshes mawe
Til he  was spouted vp at Nynyuee
Wel may men knowe  it was no wight but he
That kepte peple Ebrayk from hir drenchynge
With drye feet thurgh out the see passynge
 Who bad the foure spirites of tempest  
That power han  tanoyen lond and see
Bothe North and South  and also west and Est
Anoyeth neither  see  ne land ne tree
Soothly  the Comandour of that was he
That fro the tempest  ay this womman kepte
As wel  when she wook as whan she slepte
 Where myghte this womman  mete and drynke haue
Thre yeer and moore  how lasteth hire vitaille
Who fedde  the Egypcien Marie in the Caue
Or in desert no wight but crist  sanz faille
ffyue thousand folk  it was as greet meruaille
With loues fyue  and fisshes two to feede
God sente his foyson  at hir grete neede


 She dryueth forth  in to oure Occian
Thurgh out oure wilde see  til atte laste
Vnder an hoold  that nempnen I ne kan
ffer in Northhumberlond  the wawe hire caste
And in the sond  hir ship  stiked so faste
That thennes wolde it noght of al a tyde
The wyl of crist was þat she sholde abyde
 The Constable of the Castel  doun is fare
To seen his wrak and al the ship he soghte
And foond  this wery womman ful of care
He foond also  the tresor þat she broghte
In hir langage  mercy she bisoghte
The lyf  out of hire body for to twynne
Hire to deliuere  of wo  that she was Inne
A maner latyn corrupt  was hir speche
But algates  ther by was she vnderstonde
The Constable  whan hym lyst no lenger seche
This woful womman  broghte he to the londe
She kneleth doun  and thanketh goddes sonde
But what she was  she wolde no man seye
ffor foul ne fair  thogh þat she sholde deye
She seyde  she was  so mazed in the see
That she forgat hir mynde  by hir trouthe
The Constable  hath of hire so greet pitee
And eke his wyf  that they wepen for routhe
She was so diligent with outen slouthe
To serue and plese  euerich in that place
That alle hir louen  that looken in hir face
 This Constable  and dame Hermengyld his wyf  
Were payens  and that contree euery where
But Hermengyld  loued hire right as hir lyf
And Custance  hath so longe soiourned there


In orisons  with many a bitter teere
Til Ihesu  hath conuerted  thurgh his grace
Dame Hermengyld  Constablesse of that place
In al that lond  no cristen dorste route
Alle cristen folk  been fled fro that contree
Thurgh Payens  that conquereden al aboute
The plages of the North by land and see
To Walys  fledde the Cristyanytee
Of olde Britons  dwellynge in this Ile
Ther was hir refut for the meene while
But yet nere cristene Britons so exiled
That ther nere somme  that in hir priuetee
Honoured crist and hethen folk bigiled
And ny the Castel  swiche ther dwelten three
That oon of hem was blynd  and myghte nat see
But it were  with thilke eyen of his mynde
With whiche men seen  whan þat they ben blynde
Bright was the sonne  as in that someres day
ffor which the Constable  and his wyf also
And Custance  han ytake the righte way
Toward the see  a furlong wey or two
To pleyen  and to romen to romen to and fro
And in hir walk this blynde man they mette
Croked and oold  with eyen faste yshette
In name of Crist cride this olde Briton
Dame Hermengyld  yif me  my sighte agayn
This lady  weex affrayed of the soun
Lest that hir housbonde  shortly for to sayn
Wolde hire  for Ihesu cristes loue han slayn
Til Custance made hire boold  and bad hire wirche
The wyl of Crist as doghter of his chirche


 The Constable  weex abasshed of that sight
And seyde  what amounteth all this fare
Custance answerde  sire  it is cristes myght
That helpeth folk  out of the feendes snare
And so ferforth  she gan oure lay declare
That she the Constable  er that it were eue
Conuerteth  and on Crist maketh hym bileue
This Constable  was no thyng lord of this place  
Of which I speke  ther he Custance fond
But kepte it strongly many wyntres space
Vnder Alla  kyng of al Northhumbrelond
That was ful wys  and worthy of his hond
Agayn the Scottes  as men may wel heere
But turne I wole  agayn to my mateere
 Sathan  that euere vs waiteth to bigile
Saugh of Custance  al hire perfeccioun
And caste anon  how he myghte quite hir while
And made a yong knyght  þat dwelte in that toun
Loue hire so hoote of foul affeccioun
That verraily  hym thoughte he sholde spille
But he of hire myghte ones haue his wille
He woweth hire  but it auailleth noght
She wolde do no synne  by no weye
And for despit he compassed in his thoght
To maken hire  on shameful deeth to deye
He wayteth  whan the Constable was aweye
And pryuely  vp on a nyght he crepte
In Hermengyldes chambre  whil she slepte
 Wery  forwaked  in hire orisons
Slepeth Custance  and Hermengyld also
This knyght thurgh Sathans temptacions
All softely  is to the bed ygo


And kitte the throte  of Hermengyld atwo
And leyde the blody knyf  by dame Custance
And wente his wey  ther god yeue hym meschance
 Soone after  cometh this Constable hoom agayn
And eek Alla  þat kyng was of that lond
And saugh his wyf  despitously yslayn
ffor which ful ofte he weep  and wroong his hond
And in the bed  the blody knyf he fond
By Dame Custance  allas what myghte she seye
For verray wo  hir wit was al aweye
 To kyng Alla  was toold al this meschance
And eek the tyme  and where  and in what wise
That in a ship  was founden dame Custance
As heer biforn  that ye han herd deuyse
The kynges herte  of pitee gan agryse
Whan he saugh  so benigne a creature
ffalle in disese  and in mysauenture
ffor as the lomb  toward his deeth is broght  
So stant this Innocent bifore the kyng
This false knyght þat hath this treson wroght
Berth hire on hond  þat she hath doon thys thyng
But nathelees  ther was greet moornyng
Among the peple  and seyn  they kan nat gesse
That she had doon  so greet a wikkednesse
ffor they  han seyn hire euere so vertuous
And louynge Hermengyld  right as hir lyf
Of this baar witnesse  euerich in that hous
Saue he  þat Hermengyld  slow with his knyf
This gentil kyng  hath caught a greet motyf
Of this witnesse  and thoghte he wolde enquere
Depper in this  a trouthe for to lere


 Allas Custance  thou hast no champion
Ne fighte kanstow noght so weylaway
But he  that starf for our redempcion
And boond Sathan  and yet lith ther he lay
So be  thy stronge champion this day
ffor but if crist open myracle kithe
Withouten gilt thou shalt be slayn as swithe
She sit hire doun on knees  and thus she sayde
Immortal god  that sauedest Susanne
ffro fals blame  and thou merciful mayde
Mary I meene  doghter to Seint Anne
Bifore whos child  Angeles synge Osanne
If I be giltlees  of this felonye
My socour be  or ellis shal I dye
Haue ye nat seyn  som tyme a pale face
Among a prees  of hym þat hath be lad
Toward his deeth  wher as hym gat no grace
And swich a colour  in his face hath had
Men myghte knowe  his face that was bistad
Amonges alle the faces  in that route
So stant Custance  and looketh hire aboute
O Queenes  lyuynge in prosperitee
Duchesses  and ladyes euerichone
Haueth som routhe  on hire Aduersitee
An Emperours doghter  stant allone
She hath no wight  to whom to make hir mone
O blood roial  that stondest in this drede
ffer been thy freendes  at thy grete nede
This Alla kyng hath swich compassioun  
As gentil herte  is fulfild of pitee
That from hise eyen  ran the water doun
Now hastily  do fecche a book quod he


And if this knyght wol sweren how þat she
This womman slow  yet wol we vs auyse
Whom þat we wole  that shal been our Iustise
A Briton book  written with Euaungiles
Was fet and on this book he swoor anoon
She gilty was  and in the meene whiles
An hand hym smoot vpon the nekke boon
That doun he fil  atones as a stoon
And bothe hise eyen  broste out of his face
In sighte  of euery body in that place
 A voys was herd  in general Audience
And seyde thou hast desclaundred giltlees
The doghter of hooly chirche  in heigh presence
Thus hastou doon  and yet holde I my pees
Of this meruaille  agast was al the prees
As mazed folk they stoden euerichone
ffor drede of wreche  saue Custance allone
 Greet was the drede  and eek the repentance
Of hem  that hadden wronge suspecion
Vpon  this sely Innocent Custance
And for this miracle in conclusion
And by Custances mediacion
The kyng and many another in that place
Conuerted was  thanked be cristes grace
 This false knyght was slayn for his vntrouthe
By Iuggement of Alla hastifly
And yet Custance  hadde of his deeth greet routhe
And after this Ihesus of his mercy
Made Alla wedden ful solempnely
This hooly mayden  that is so bright and sheene
And thus hath crist ymaad Custance a queene


But who was woful  if I shal nat lye
Of this weddyng but Donegild and na mo
The kynges mooder  ful of tirannye
Hir thoughte  hir cursed herte brast atwo
She wolde noght hir sone had do so
Hir thoughte a despit that he sholde take
So strange a creature vn to his make
 Me list nat of the chaf  or of the stree  
Maken so long a tale  as of the corn
What sholde I tellen  of the roialtee
At mariages  or which cours goth biforn
Who bloweth in the trumpe  or in an horn
The fruyt of euery tale  is for to seye
They ete  and drynke  and daunce  and synge and pleye
They goon to bedde  as it was skile and right
ffor thogh þat wyues  be ful hooly thynges
They moste take  in pacience at nyght
Swiche manere necessaries  as been plesynges
To folk  þat han ywedded hem with rynges
And leye a lite  hir hoolynesse aside
As for the tyme  it may no bet bitide
On hire he gat a man childe anon
And to a bisshop  and his Constable eke
He took his wyf to kepe  whan he is gon
To Scotlondward  his foomen for to seke
Now faire Custance  that is so humble and meke
So longe is goon with childe  til that stille
She halt hire chambre  abidyng cristes wille
The tyme is come  a man child she beer
Mauricius at the fontstoon  they hym calle
This Constable  dooth forth come a Messageer
And wroot vn to his kyng that cleped was Alle


How that this blisful tidyng is bifalle
And othere tidynges  spedeful for to seye
He taketh the lettre  and forth he gooth his weye
 This Messager  to doon his auantage
Vn to the kynges mooder rideth swithe
And salueth hire ful faire in his langage
Madame quod he  ye may be glad and blithe
And thanketh god  an hundred thousand sithe
My lady queene  hath child with outen doute
To ioye and blisse  to al this regne aboute
Lo heere the lettres  seled of this thyng
That I moot bere  with al the haste I may
If ye wol aught vn to youre sone the kyng
I am youre seruant bothe nyght and day
Donegild answerde  as now at this tyme nay
But heere al nyght  I wol thou take thy reste
Tomorwe  wol I seye thee  what me leste
 This Messager  drank sadly ale and wyn  
And stolen were hise lettres pryuely
Out of his box  whil he sleep as a swyn
And countrefeted was ful subtilly
Another lettre  wroght ful synfully
Vn to the kyng direct of this mateere
ffro his Constable  as ye shal after heere
The lettre spak the queene deliuered was
Of so horrible a feendly creature
That in the Castel  noon so hardy was
That any while  dorste ther endure
The mooder was an Elf by auenture
Ycomen  by charmes  or by sorcerie
And euerich  hateth hir compaignye


 Wo was this kyng whan he this lettre had sayn
But to no wight he tolde his sorwes soore
But of his owene hand  he wroot agayn
Wel come the sonde of crist for eueremoore
To me  that am now lerned in his loore
Lord  wel come be thy lust and thy plesance
My lust I putte al in thyn ordinance
Kepeth this child  al be it foul or feir
And eek my wyf  vn to myn hoom comynge
Crist whan hym list may sende me an heir
Moore agreable than this  to my likynge
This lettre he seleth pryuely wepynge
Which to the Messager  was take soone
And forth he gooth  ther is na moore to doone
O Messager  fulfild of dronkenesse
Strong is thy breeth  thy lymes faltren ay
And thou biwreyest  alle secreenesse
Thy mynde is lorn  thou ianglest as a Iay
Thy face is turned  in a newe array
Ther dronkenesse  regneth in any route
Ther is no conseil hyd  with outen doute
O Donegild  I ne haue noon englissh digne
Vn to thy malice  and thy tirannye
And therfore  to the feend I thee resigne
Lat hym enditen  of thy traitorie
ffy mannysh fy  o nay by god I lye
ffy feendlych spirit for I dar wel telle
Thogh thou heere walke  thy spirit is in helle
 This Messager  comth fro the kyng agayn  
And at the kynges moodres1 court he lighte1
And she was  of this Messager ful fayn
And plesed hym  in al that euer she myghte


He drank  and wel his girdel vnderpighte
He slepeth  and he snoreth in his gyse
All nyght til the sonne gan aryse
Eft were hise lettres stolen euerychon
And countrefeted lettres  in this wyse
The king comandeth  his Constable anon
Vp peyne of hangyng and on heigh Iuyse
That he ne sholde  suffren in no wyse
Custance  in with his Reawme for tabyde
Thre dayes  and o quarter of a tyde
But in the same ship  as he hire fond
Hire and hir yonge sone  and al hir geere
He sholde putte  and croude hire fro the lond
And chargen hire  she neuer eft coome theere
O my Custance  wel may thy goost haue feere
And slepynge in thy dreem  been in penance
Whan Donegild  cast al this ordinance
 This Messager  on morwe  whan he wook
Vn to the Castel  halt the nexte way
And to the Constable  he the lettre took
And whan þat he  this pitous lettre say
fful ofte he seyde  Allas and weylaway
Lord crist quod he  how may this world endure
So ful of synne  is many a creature
 O myghty god  if that it be thy wille
Sith thou art rightful Iuge  how may it be
That thou wolt suffren  Innocentz to spille
And wikked folk  regnen in prosperitee
O goode Custance  Allas so wo is me
That I moot be thy tormentour or deye
On shames deeth  ther is noon oother weye


 Wepen bothe yonge and olde  in al that place
Whan þat the kyng this cursed lettre sente
And Custance  with a deedly pale face
The ferthe day  toward the ship she wente
But nathelees  she taketh in good entente
The wyl of Crist and knelynge on the Stronde
She seyde lord  ay wel come be thy sonde
He that me kepte  fro the false blame  
While I was  on the lond amonges yow
He kan me kepe  from harm  and eek fro shame
In salte see  al thogh I se noght how
As strong as euere he was  he is yet now
In hym triste I  and in his mooder deere
That is to me  my seyl  and eek my steere
Hir litel child  lay wepyng in hir arm
And knelynge  pitously  to hym she seyde
Pees litel sone  I wol do thee noon harm
With that hir couerchief  ouer hir heed she breyde
And ouer hise litel eyen  she it leyde
And in hir Arm  she lulleth it ful faste
And in to heuene  hire eyen vp she caste
 Mooder quod she  and mayde bright Marie
Sooth is  that thurgh wommanes eggement
Man kynde was lorn  and damned ay to dye
ffor which thy child  was on a croys yrent
Thy blisful eyen  sawe al his torment
Thanne is ther  no comparison bitwene
Thy wo  and any wo  man may sustene
Thow sawe thy child yslayn bifore thyne eyen
And yet now  lyueth my child parfay
Now lady bright  to whom alle woful cryen
Thow glorie of wommanhede  thow faire may


Thow hauen of refut brighte sterre of day
Rewe on my child  that of thy gentillesse
Ruest on euery reweful in distresse
 O litel child  allas what is thy gilt
That neuere wroghtest synne  as yet pardee
Why wil thyn harde fader  han thee spilt
O mercy deere Constable quod she
As lat my litel child  dwelle heer with thee
And if thou darst nat sauen hym for blame
Yet kys hym ones  in his fadres name
Ther with  she looked  bakward to the londe
And seyde  fare wel housbonde routhelees
And vp she rist  and walketh doun the stronde
Toward the Ship  hir folweth al the prees
And euere she preyeth hire child  to holde his pees
And taketh hir leue  and with an hooly entente
She blissed hire  and in to ship she wente
Vitailled was the ship  it is no drede  
Habundantly  for hire ful longe space
And othere necessaries  that sholde nede
She hadde ynogh  heryed be goddes grace
ffor wynd and weder  almyghty god purchace
And brynge hire hoom  I kan no bettre seye
But in the see  she dryueth forth hir weye
Alla the kyng  comth hoom soone after this
Vn to his Castel  of the which I tolde
And asketh  where his wyf  and his child is
The Constable  gan aboute his herte colde


And pleynly  al the manere he hym tolde
As ye han herd  I kan telle it no bettre
And sheweth the kyng his seel and his lettre
And seyde  lord  as ye comanded me
Vp peyne of deeth  so haue I doon certein
This Messager  tormented was til he
Moste biknowe  and tellen plat and pleyn
ffro nyght to nyght  in what place he had leyn
And thus by wit  and sobtil enquerynge
Ymagined was  by whom this harm gan sprynge
 The hand was knowe  that the lettre wroot
And all the venym  of this cursed dede
But in what wise  certeinly I noot
Theffect is this  þat Alla out of drede
His mooder slow  that may men pleynly rede
ffor þat she traitoure was to hire ligeance
Thus endeth olde Donegild with meschance
The sorwe that this Alla  nyght and day
Maketh for his wyf  and for his child also
Ther is no tonge  that it telle may
But now wol I  vn to Custance go
That fleteth in the see  in peyne and wo
ffyue yeer and moore  as liked cristes sonde
Er that hir ship  approched vn to the londe
 Vnder an hethen Castel  atte laste  
Of which the name  in my text noght I fynde
Custance  and eek hir child  the see vp caste
Almyghty god  that saued al mankynde
Haue on Custance  and on hir child som mynde
That fallen is  in hethen hand eft soone
In point to spille  as I shal telle yow soone


 Doun fro the Castel  comth ther many a wight
To gauren on this ship  and on Custance
But shortly  from the Castel  on a nyght
The lordes styward  god yeue him meschance
A theef  that hadde reneyed oure creance
Came in to the ship allone  and seyde he sholde
Hir lemman be  wher so she wolde or nolde
 Wo was this wrecched womman tho bigon
Hir child cride  and she cride pitously
But blisful Marie  heelp hire right anon
ffor with hir struglyng wel and myghtily
The theef fil ouer bord  al sodeynly
And in the see  he dreynte for vengeance
And thus hath crist vnwemmed kept Custance
O foule lust of luxurie  lo thyn ende
Nat oonly  that thou feyntest mannes mynde
But verraily  thou wolt his body shende
Thende of thy werk or of thy lustes blynde
Is compleynyng hou many oon may men fynde
That noght for werk som tyme  but for thentente
To doon this synne  been outher slayn or shente
How may this wayke womman  han this strengthe
Hire to defende  agayn this renegat
O Golias  vnmesurable of lengthe
Hou myghte Dauid  make thee so maat
So yong and of Armure so desolaat
Hou dorste he looke  vp on thy dredful face
Wel may men seen  it nas but goddes grace
Who yaf Iudith  corage or hardynesse
To sleen hym Oloferne  in his tente
And to deliueren  out of wrecchednesse
The peple of god  I seye for this entente


That right as god  spirit of vigour sente
To hem  and saued hem  out of meschance
So sente he myght and vigour to Custance
 fforth gooth hir ship  thurgh out the narwe mouth  
Of Iubaltare and Septe dryuynge alway
Som tyme West and som tyme North and South
And som tyme est ful many a wery day
Til cristes mooder  blessed be she ay
Hath shapen  thurgh hir endelees goodnesse
To make an ende  of al hir heuynesse
Now lat vs stynte  of Custance but a throwe
And speke we  of the Romayn Emperour
That out of Surrye  hath by lettres knowe
The slaughtre of cristen folk  and dishonour
Doon to his doghter  by a fals traytour
I mene  the cursed wikked Sowdanesse
That at the feeste  leet sleen both moore and lesse
ffor which this Emperour  hath sent anon
His senatour  with roial ordinance
And othere lordes  god woot many oon
On Surryens  to taken heigh vengeance
They brennen  sleen  and brynge hem to meschance
Ful many a day  but shortly  this is thende
Homward to Rome  they shapen hem to wende
 This senatour  repaireth with victorie
To Rome ward saillynge ful Roially
And mette the ship dryuynge  as seith the storie
In which Custance  sit ful pitously
No thyng knew he  what she was  ne why
She was in swich array  ne she nyl seye
Of hire estaat thogh she sholde deye


He bryngeth hire to Rome  and to his wyf
He yaf hire  and hir yonge sone also
And with the senatour  she ladde hir lyf
Thus kan oure lady  bryngen out of wo
Woful Custance  and many another mo
And longe tyme  dwelled she in that place
In hooly werkes euere  as was hir grace
The senatours wyf  hir Aunte was
But for all that she knew hire neuer the moore
I wol no lenger  tarien in this cas
But to kyng Alla  which I spake of yoore
That wepeth for his wyf  and siketh soore
I wol retourne  and lete I wol Custance
Vnder  the Senatours gouernance
Kyng Alla  which that hadde his mooder slayn  
Vp on a day fil in swich repentance
That if I  shortly  tellen shal and playn
To Rome he comth  to receyuen his penance
And putte hym  in the popes ordinance
In heigh and logh  and Ihesu crist bisoghte
fforyeue  hise wikked werkes þat he wroghte
 The fame anon  thurgh out the toun is born
How Alla kyng  shal comen on pilgrymage
By herbergeours  that wenten hym biforn
ffor which  the Senatour  as was vsage
Rood hym agayns  and many of his lynage
As wel to shewen  his heighe magnificence
As to doon  any kyng a reuerence
 Greet cheere  dooth this noble Senatour
To kyng Alla  and he to hym also
Euerich of hem  dooth oother greet honour
And so bifel  that in with a day or two


This Senatour  is to kyng Alla go
To feste  and shortly  if I shal nat lye
Custances sone  wente in his compaignye
 Som men wolde seyn  at requeste of Custance
This Senatour  hath lad this child to feeste
I may nat tellen  euery circumstance
Be as be may  ther was he at the leeste
But sooth is this  that at his moodres heeste
Biforn Alla  durynge the metes space
The child stood  lookynge in the kynges face
 This Alla kyng hath of this child greet wonder
And to the senatour  he seyde anon
Whos is that faire child  that stondeth yonder
I noot quod he  by god  and by seint Iohn
A mooder he hath  but fader hath he noon
That I of woot but shortly  in a stounde
He tolde Alla  how that this child was founde
But god woot quod this senatour also
So vertuous a lyuere in my lyf
Ne saugh I neuere as she  ne herde of mo
Of worldly wommen  mayde ne of wyf
I dar wel seyn  hir hadde leuere a knyf
Thurgh out hir brest than ben a womman wikke
There is no man  koude brynge hire to that prikke
 Now was this child  as lyke vn to Custance  
As possible is  a creature to be
This Alla  hath the face in remembrance
Of dame Custance  and ther on mused he
If that the childes mooder  were aught she
That is his wyf  and pryuely he sighte
And spedde hym fro the table  that he myghte


Parfay thoghte he  fantome is in myn heed
I oghte deme  of skilful Iuggement
That in the salte see  my wyf is deed
And afterward  he made his Argument
What woot I  if that Crist haue hyder ysent
My wyf by see  as wel as he hire sente
To my contree  fro thennes that she wente
And after Noon  hoom with the Senatour
Goth Alla  for to seen this wonder chaunce
This Senatour  dooth Alla greet honour
And hastifly  he sente after Custaunce
But trusteth weel  hire liste nat to daunce
Whan þat she wiste  wherfore was that sonde
Vnnethe  vp on hir feet she myghte stonde
 Whan Alla saugh his wyf faire he hire grette
And weep  that it was routhe for to see
ffor at the firste look he on hire sette
He knew wel verraily  that it was she
And she for sorwe  as doumb stant as a tree
So was hir herte shet in hir distresse
Whan she remembred  his vnkyndenesse
Twyes she swowned  in his owene sighte
He weep  and hym excuseth pitously
Now god quod he  and hise halwes brighte
So wisly on my soule  as haue mercy
That of youre harm  as giltlees am I
As is Maurice my sone  so lyk youre face
Elles the feend  me fecche out of this place
 Long was the sobbyng and the bitter peyne
Er that  hir woful hertes myghte cesse
Greet was the pitee  for to heere hem pleyne
Thurgh whiche pleintes  gan hir wo encresse


I pray yow alle  my labour to relesse
I may nat telle hir wo  vn til to morwe
I am so wery  for to speke of sorwe
But finally  whan that the sothe is wist  
That Alla giltlees  was of hir wo
I trowe  an hundred tymes  been they kist
And swich a blisse  is ther bitwix hem two
That saue the ioye  that lasteth eueremo
Ther is noon lyk  that any creature
Hath seyn or  shal  whil þat the world may dure
Tho preyde she hir housbonde mekely
In relief  of hir longe pitous pyne
That he wolde preye  hir fader specially
That of his magestee  he wolde enclyne
To vouche sauf  som day with hym to dyne
She preyde hym eek  he wolde by no weye
Vn to hir fader  no word of hire seye
 Som men wold seyn  how þat the child Maurice
Dooth this Message  vn to this Emperour
But as I gesse  Alla was nat so nyce
To hym that was  of so souereyn honour
As he that is  of cristen folk the flour
Sente any child  but it is bet to deeme
He wente hym self  and so it may wel seeme
 This Emperour  hath graunted gentilly
To come to dyner  as he hym bisoughte
And wel rede I  he looked bisily
Vp on this child  and on his doghter thoghte
Alla goth to his In  and as him oghte
Arrayed for this feste  in euery wise
As ferforth  as his konnyng may suffise


 The morwe cam  and Alla gan hym dresse
And eek his wyf  this Emperour to meete
And forth they ryde  in ioye and in gladnesse
And whan she saugh  hir fader in the strete
She lighte doun  and falleth hym to feete
ffader quod she  youre yonge child Custance
Is now ful clene  out of youre remembrance
I am youre doghter  Custance quod she
That whilom  ye han sent  vn to Surrye
It am I fader  that in the salte see
Was put allone  and dampned for to dye
Now goode fader  mercy I yow crye
Sende me namoore  vn to noon hethenesse
But thonketh my lord heere  of his kyndenesse
 Who kan  the pitous ioye  tellen al  
Bitwixe hem thre  syn they been thus ymette
But of my tale  make an ende I shal
The day goth faste  I wol no lenger lette
This glade folk  to dyner they hem sette
In ioye and blisse  at mete I lete hem dwelle
A thousand foold  wel moore than I kan telle
 This child Maurice  was sithen Emperour
Maad by the pope  and lyued cristenly
To cristes chirche  he dide greet honour
But I lete all his storie passen by
Of Custance  is my tale specially
In the olde Romane geestes  may men fynde
Maurices lyf  I bere it noght in mynde
 This kyng Alla  whan he his tyme say
With his Custance  his hooly wyf so sweete
To Engelond  been they come the righte way
Wher as they lyue  in ioye and in quiete


But litel while it lasteth  I yow heete
Ioye of this world  for tyme wol nat abyde
ffro day to nyght  it changeth as the tyde
Who lyued euere  in swich delit o day
That hym ne moeued  outher conscience
Or Ire  or talent or som kynnes affray
Enuye  or pride  or passion  or offence
I ne seye but for this ende this sentence
That litel while in ioye  or in plesance
Lasteth the blisse of Alla with Custance
ffor deeth  that taketh  of heigh and logh  his rente
Whan passed was a yeer  euene as I gesse
Out of this world  this kyng Alla he hente
For whom  Custance  hath ful greet heuynesse
Now lat vs praye to god  his soule blesse
And dame Custance  finally to seye
Toward the toun of Rome  goth hir weye
 To Rome is come  this hooly creature
And fyndeth hire freendes  hoole and sounde
Now is she scaped  al hire auenture
And whan þat she  hir fader hath yfounde
Doun on hir knees  falleth she to grounde
Wepynge for tendrenesse  in herte blithe
She heryeth god  an hundred thousand sithe
 In vertu  and hooly almus dede  
They lyuen alle  and neuere a sonder wende
Till deeth departed hem  this lyf they lede
And fareth now weel  my tale is at an ende
Now Ihesu Crist that of his myght may sende
Ioye after wo  gouerne vs in his grace
And kepe vs alle  that been in this place Amen
Experience  though noon Auctoritee
Were in this world  were right ynogh to me
To speke of wo  that is in mariage
ffor lordynges  sith I xij yeer was of Age
Ythonked be god  that is eterne on lyue
Housbondes at chirche dore I haue had fyue
ffor I so ofte  haue ywedded bee
And alle  were worthy men in hir degree
But me was toold certeyn  nat longe agoon is
That sith that Crist ne wente neuere but onis
To weddyng in the Cane of Galilee
By the same  ensample  thoughte me
That I ne sholde  wedded be but ones
Herkne eek  which a sharpe word for the nones
Beside a welle  Ihesus god and man
Spak  in repreeue of the Samaritan
Thou hast yhad  fyue housbondes quod he
And that man  the which þat hath now thee
Is noght thyn housbonde  thus seyde he certeyn
What that he mente ther by  I kan nat seyn
But þat I axe  why that the fifthe man
Was noon housbonde to the samaritan
How manye  myghte she haue in mariage
Yet herde I neuere tellen in myn age
  
Vpon this nombre diffinicioun
Men may deuyne  and glosen vp and doun
But wel I woot expres withoute lye
God bad vs  for to wexe and multiplye
That gentil text kan I  vnderstonde
Eek wel I woot he seyde myn housbonde
Sholde lete fader and mooder  and take me
But of no nombre  mencion made he
Of bigamye  or of Octogamye  
Why sholde men  speke of it vileynye
 Lo heere  the wise kyng dann salomon
I trowe  he hadde wyues  mo than oon
As wolde god  it were leueful vnto me
To be refresshed  half so ofte as he
Which yifte of God  hadde he  for alle hise wyuys
No man hath swich  þat in this world alyue is
God woot  this noble kyng as to my wit
The firste nyght had many a myrie fit
With ech of hem  so wel was hym on lyue
Yblessed be god  that I haue wedded fyue
Welcome the sixte  whan that euere he shal
ffor sothe  I wol nat kepe me chaast in al
Whan myn housbonde  is fro the world ygon
Som cristen man  shal wedde me anon
ffor thanne  thapostle seith  I am free
To wedde a goddes half where 1it liketh1 me
He seith  to be wedded  is no synne
Bet is  to be wedded  than to brynne
What rekketh me  thogh folk seye vileynye
Of shrewed lameth  and of bigamye
I woot wel  Abraham  was an hooly man
And Iacob eek as ferforth as I kan
And ech of hem  hadde wyues mo than two
And many another man Also
Whanne saugh ye euere  in  manere Age
That hye god  defended mariage  
By expres word  I pray you telleth me
Or where  comanded he virginitee
I woot as wel as ye  it is no drede
Whan thapostel  speketh of maydenhede
He seyde  that precept therof hadde he noon
Men may conseille  a womman to been oon
But conseillyng is nat comandement
He putte it in oure owene Iuggement
ffor hadde god  comanded maydenhede
Thanne hadde he dampned weddyng with the dede
And certein  if ther were  no seed ysowe
Virginitee  wherof thanne sholde it growe
Poul  ne dorste nat  comanden atte leeste
A thyng of which his maister yaf noon heeste
The dart is set vp  of virginitee
Cacche who so may  who renneth best lat see
 But this word  is nat taken of euery wight
But ther  as god lust gyue it of his myght
I woot wel  the Apostel was a mayde
But nathelees  thogh  that he wroot and sayde
He wolde  þat euery wight  were swich as he  
Al nys  but conseil to virginitee
And for to been a wyf  he yaf me leue
Of Indulgence  so it is no repreue
To wedde me  if my make dye
With outen  excepcion of Bigamye
Al were it good  no womman for to touche
He mente  as in his bed  or in his couche
ffor peril is  bothe fyr and tow tassemble
Ye knowe  what this ensample may resemble
This is al and som  that virginitee
Moore profiteth  than weddyng  in freletee
ffreeltee clepe I  but if that he and she
Wolde lede  al hir lyf in chastitee
 I graunte it wel  I haue noon envie
Thogh maydenhede preferre Bigamye
  
Hem liketh to be clene  body and goost
Of myn estaat I nyl nat make no boost
ffor wel ye knowe  a lord in his houshold
He nath nat euery vessel  al of gold
Somme been of tree  and doon hir lord seruyse
God clepeth folk to hym  in sondry wyse
And euerich hath of god a propre yifte
Som this som that as hym liketh shifte
 Virginitee  is greet perfeccion
And continence eek with deuocion
But crist that of perfeccion is welle
Bad nat euery wight  sholde go selle
All that he hadde  and gyue it to the poore
And in swich wise  folwe hym and his foore
He spak to hem  that wolde lyue parfitly
And lordynges by youre leue  that am nat I
I wol bistowe  the flour of myn age
In the Actes and in fruyt of mariage
 Telle me also  to what conclusion
Were membres ymaad  of generacion
And for what profit was a wight ywroght
Trusteth right wel  they were nat maad for noght
Glose who so wole  and seye bothe vp and doun
That they were maad  for purgacioun
Of vryne bothe  and thynges smale
And eek to knowe  a femele from a male
And for noon oother cause  sey ye no
The experience  woot wel it is noght so
So that the clerkes  be nat with me wrothe
I sey yis  that they beth maked for bothe
This is to seye  for office and for ese
Of engendrure  ther we nat god displese
Why sholde men elles  in hir bookes sette  
That a man shal yelde  to his wyf hire dette
Now wher with  sholde he make his paiement
If he ne vsed  his sely Instrument
  
 Abyde quod she  my tale is nat bigonne
Nay  thou shalt drynken of another tonne
Er that I go  shal sauoure wors than Ale
And whan þat I  haue toold forth my tale
Of tribulacion  that is in mariage
Of which  I am expert in al myn age
This to seyn  my self haue been the whippe
Than maystow chese  wheither thou wolt sippe
Of that tonne  that I shal abroche  
Be war of it er thou to ny approche
ffor I shal tell ensamples  mo than ten
Who so  þat wol nat be war  by othere men
By hym  shul othere men corrected be
The same wordes  writeth Protholomee
Rede it in his Almageste  and take it there
 Dame  I wolde praye  if youre wyl it were
Seyde this Pardoner  as ye bigan
Telle forth youre tale  spareth for no man
And teche vs yonge men  of youre praktike
 Gladly sires  sith it may yow like
But yet I praye  to al this compaignye
If that I speke  after my fantasye
As taketh not agrief  that I seye
ffor myn entente  is but for to pleye
NOw sire  now wol I telle forth my tale
As euere  moote I drynken wyn or Ale
I shal seye sooth  of tho housbondes þat I hadde
As thre of hem were goode  and two were badde
The thre men  were goode  and riche  and olde
Vnnethe  myghte they  the statut holde
In which  that they were  bounden vnto me
Ye woot wel  what I meene of this pardee
As help me god  I laughe whan I thynke
How pitously  anyght I made hem swynke
And by my fey  I tolde of it no stoor
They had me yeuen hir gold and hir tresoor
  
Thanne were they maad  vpon a creature
To purge vryne  and for engendrure
 But I seye noght þat euery wight is holde
That hath swich harneys  as I of tolde
To goon and vsen hem in engendrure
They shul nat take  of chastitee no cure
Crist was a mayde  and shapen as a man
And many a seint sith the world bigan
Yet lyued they euere  in perfit chastitee
I nyl nat enuye  no virginitee
Lat hem be breed  of pured whete seed
And lat vs wyues  hoten barly breed
And yet with barly breed  Mark telle kan
Oure lord  refresshed many a man
In swich estaat as god hath cleped vs
I wol perseuere  I nam nat precius
In wyfhode I wol vse myn Instrument
As frely  as my makere hath it sent
If I be daungerous  god yeue me sorwe
Myn housbonde shal it haue  bothe eue and morwe
Whan þat hym list com forth and paye his dette
An housbonde I wol haue  I nyl nat lette
Which shal be  bothe my dettour  and my thral
And haue  his tribulacion with al
Vpon his flessh  whil that I am his wyf
I haue the power  durynge al my lyf
Vpon his propre body  and noght he
Right thus  the Apostel  tolde it vnto me
And bad oure housbondes  for to loue vs weel
Al this sentence  me liketh euery deel
Vp stirte the Pardoner  and that anon
Now dame quod he  by god and by seint Iohn
Ye been a noble prechour in this cas
I was aboute  to wedde a wyf allas
What sholde I bye it on my flessh so deere
Yet hadde I leuere  wedde no wyf to yeere
  
Me neded nat  do lenger diligence
To wynne hir loue  or doon hem reuerence
They loued me so wel  by god aboue
That I ne tolde  no deyntee of hir loue
A wys womman  wol sette hire euere in oon
To gete hire loue  ther as she hath noon
But sith I hadde hem  hoolly in myn hond
And sith  they hadde  me yeuen all hir lond
What sholde I taken heede  hem for to plese
But it were  for my profit and myn ese
I sette hem so a werk  by my fey
That many a nyght they songen weilawey
The bacon  was nat fet for hem I trowe
That som men han  in Essexe at Dunmowe
I gouerned hem  so wel after my lawe
That ech of hem  was ful blisful and fawe
To brynge me  gaye thynges  fro the ffayre
They were ful glad  whan I spak to hem faire
ffor god it woot  I chidde hem spitously
 Now herkneth  hou I baar me proprely
Ye wise wyues  that kan vnderstonde  
 Thus shul ye speke  and beren hem on honde
ffor half so boldely  kan ther no man
Swere and lye  as kan a womman
I sey nat this  by wyues þat been wyse
But if it be  whan they hem mysauyse
A wys wyf  if that she kan hir good
Shal bere hym on hond  the Cow is wood
And take witnesse  of hir owene mayde
Of hir assent but herkneth how I sayde
 Sire olde kaynard  is this thyn array
Why is  my neighebores wyf so gay
She is honoured  ouer al ther she gooth
I sitte at hoom  I haue no thrifty clooth
What dostow  at my neighebores hous
Is she so fair  artow so amorous
  
What rowne ye with oure mayde benedicite
Sire olde lecchour  lat thy Iapes be
And if I haue  a gossib or a freend
Withouten gilt thou chidest as a feend
If that I walke  or pleye vnto his hous
Thou comest hoom  as dronken as a Mous
And prechest on thy bench  with yuel preef
Thou seist to me  it is a greet meschief
To wedde a poure womman for costage
And if she be riche  and of heigh parage
Thanne seistow  it is a tormentrie
To soffren hire pride  and hire malencolie
And if that she be fair  thou verray knaue
Thou seyst that euery holour wol hire haue
She may no while  in chastitee abyde
That is assailled  vpon ech a syde
 Thou seyst that som folk  desiren vs  for richesse
Somme for oure shape  somme for oure fairnesse
And som  for she kan synge and daunce
And som for gentillesse  and som for daliaunce
Som for hir handes  and hir Armes smale
Thus goth al to the deuel  by thy tale
Thou seyst men may nat kepe a Castel wal
It may so longe  assailled been ouer al
 And if that she be foul  thou seist that she
Coueiteth euery man  that she may se
ffor as a spaynel  she wol on hym lepe
Til þat she fynde  som man hire to chepe
Ne noon so grey goos gooth in the lake
As seistow  wol been withoute make
And seyst it is an hard thyng for to welde
A thyng þat no man wole his thankes helde
Thus seistow lorel  whan thow goost to bedde  
And þat no wys man  nedeth for to wedde
Ne no man  that entendeth vnto heuene
With wilde thonder dynt and firy leuene
  
Moote  thy welked nekke be tobroke
 Thow seyst that droppyng houses  and eek smoke
And chidyng wyues  maken men to flee
Out of hir owene houses  a benedicitee
What eyleth  swich an old man for to chide
 Thow seyst þat we wyues  wol oure vices hide
Til we be fast and thanne we wol hem shewe
Wel may that be  a prouerbe of a shrewe
 Thou seist þat Oxen  Asses  hors  and houndes
They been assayd  at diuerse stoundes
Bacyns  lauours  er that men hem bye
Spoones and stooles  and al swich housbondrye
And so been  pottes clothes  and array
But folk of wyues  maken noon assay
Til they be wedded  olde dotard shrewe
Thanne seistow  we wol oure vices shewe
 Thou seist also  that it displeseth me
But if that thou  wolt preyse my beautee
And but thou poure alwey  vpon my face
And clepe me faire dame in euery place
And but thou make a feeste  on thilke day
That I was born  and make me fressh and gay
And but thou do  to my norice honour
And to my chambrere  withInne my bour
And to my fadres folk  and hise allyes
Thus seistow  olde barel ful of lyes
 And yet of oure Apprentice  Ianekyn
ffor his crispe heer  shynynge as gold so fyn
And for he squiereth me  bothe vp and doun
Yet hastow caught a fals suspecioun
I wol hym noght  thogh thou were deed tomorwe
 But tel me  why hydestow with sorwe
The keyes of my cheste  awey fro me
It is my good  as wel as thyn pardee
What wenestow  to make an ydiot of oure dame
Now by that lord  that called is seint Iame
  
Thou shalt nat bothe  thogh thou were wood
Be maister  of my body  and of my good
That oon thou shalt forgo  maugree thyne eyen
What nedeth thee  of me  to enquere or spyen
I trowe  thou woldest loke me in thy chiste
Thou sholdest seye  wyf go wher thee liste
Taak youre disport I wol leue no talys
I knowe yow  for a trewe wyf dame Alys
We loue no man  that taketh kepe  or charge  
Wher that we goon  we wol ben at our large
 Of alle men  blessed moot he be
The wise Astrologien  Daun Protholome
That seith this prouerbe  in his Almageste
Of alle men  his wysdom is the hyeste
That rekketh neuere  who hath the world in honde
By this prouerbe  thou shalt vnderstonde
Haue thou ynogh  what thar thee recche or care
How myrily  that othere folkes fare
ffor certeyn  olde dotard by youre leue
Ye shul haue queynte  right ynogh at eue
He is to greet a nygard  that wolde werne
A man  to lighte his candle at his lanterne
He shal haue  neuer the lasse light pardee
Haue thou ynogh  thee thar nat pleyne thee
 Thou seyst also  þat if we make vs gay
With clothyng and with precious array
That it is peril of oure chastitee
And yet with sorwe  thou most enforce thee
And seye thise wordes  in the Apostles name
In habit maad  with chastitee and shame
Ye wommen  shul apparaille yow quod he
And noght in tressed heer  and gay perree
As perles  ne with gold  ne clothes riche
After thy text ne after thy Rubriche
I wol nat wirche  as muchel as a gnat
 Thou seydest this  that I was lyk a Cat
  
ffor who so wolde  senge a Cattes skyn
Thanne wolde the Cat wel dwellen in his In
And if the Cattes skyn  be slyk and gay
She wol nat dwelle in house  half a day
But forth she wole  er any day be dawed
To shewe hir skyn  and goon a Caterwawed
This is to seye  if I be gay sire shrewe
I wol renne out  my borel for to shewe
 Sire olde fool  what eyleth thee to spyen
Thogh thou preye Argus  with hise hundred eyen
To be my wardecors  as he kan best
In feith  he shal nat kepe me but lest
Yet koude I make his berd  so moot I thee
 Thou seydest eek  that ther been thynges thre
The whiche thynges  troublen al this erthe
And þat no wight  may endure the ferthe
O leeue sire shrewe  Ihesu  shorte thy lyf 
Yet prechestow  and seyst and hateful wyf
Yrekened is  for oon of thise meschances
Been ther none othere resemblances
That ye may likne  youre parables to  
But if a sely wyf  be oon of tho
 Thou liknest wommenes loue to helle
To bareyne lond  ther water may nat dwelle
 Thou liknest it also  to wilde fyr
The moore it brenneth  the moore it hath desir
To consumen euery thyng þat brent wole be
Thou seyst  right as wormes shendeth a tree
Right so a wyf destroyeth hire housbond
This knowe they  that been to wyues bonde
LOrdynges  right thus  as ye haue vnderstonde
Baar I stifly  myne olde housbondes on honde
That thus they seyden  in hir dronkenesse
And al was fals  but that I took witnesse
On Ianekyn  and on my Nece also
O lord  the peyne I dide hem  and the wo
  
fful giltlees  by goddes sweete pyne
ffor as an hors  I koude byte and whyne
I koude pleyne  thogh I were in the gilt
Or elles  often tyme  hadde I been spilt
Who so comth first to Mille  first grynt
I pleyned first  so was oure werre ystynt
They were ful glad  to excusen hem blyue
Of thyng  of which they neuere agilte hir lyue
 Of wenches  wolde I beren hym on honde
Whan that for syk vnnethes myghte he stonde
Yet tikled it his herte  for that he
Wende  þat I hadde of hym so greet chiertee
I swoor  þat al my walkynge out by nyghte
Was  for tespye wenches þat he dighte
Vnder that colour  hadde I many a myrthe
ffor al swich thyng was yeuen vs in oure byrthe
Deceite  wepyng spynnyng god hath yeue
To wommen kyndely  whil that they may lyue
And thus  of o thyng I auaunte me
Atte ende  I hadde the bettre in ech degree
By sleighte  or force  or by som maner thyng
As by continueel murmure or grucchyng
Namely  abedde  hadden they meschaunce
Ther wolde I chide  and do hem no plesaunce
I wolde  no lenger in the bed abyde
If that I felte his Arm ouer my syde
Til he  had maad  his raunson vnto me
Thanne wolde I suffre hym  do his nycetee
And therfore  euery man  this tale I telle
Wynne who so may  for al is for to selle
With empty hand  men may none haukes lure
ffor wynnyng wolde I al his lust endure
And make me  a feyned appetit  
And yet in bacon  hadde I neuere delit
That made me  that euere I wolde hem chide
ffor thogh the pope  hadde seten hem biside
  
I wolde nat spare hem  at hir owene bord
ffor by my trouthe  I quitte hem word for word
As helpe me  verray god omnipotent
Though I right now  sholde make my testament
I ne owe hem nat a word  þat it nys quit
I broghte it so aboute by my wit
That they moste yeue it vp  as for the beste
Or elles  hadde we neuere been in rest
ffor thogh he looked  as a wood leon
Yet sholde he faille  of his conclusion
 Thanne wolde I seye  goode lief taak keepe
How mekely  looketh Wilkyn oure sheepe
Com neer my spouse  lat me ba thy cheke
Ye sholde been  al pacient and meke
And han  a sweete spiced conscience
Sith ye so preche  of Iobes pacience
Suffreth alwey  syn ye so wel kan preche
And but ye do  certein we shal yow teche
That it is fair  to haue a wyf in pees
Oon of vs two  moste bowen doutelees
And sith a man  is moore resonable
Than womman is  ye moste been suffrable
What eyleth yow  to grucche thus and grone
Is it for ye wolde haue my queynte allone
Wy taak it al  lo haue it euery deel
Peter I shrewe yow  but ye loue it weel
ffor if I wolde  selle my bele chose
I koude walke  as fressh as is a rose
But I wol kepe  it for youre owene tooth
Ye be to blame  by god  I sey yow sooth
 Swiche manere wordes hadde we on honde
Now wol I speken  of my fourthe housbonde
My fourthe housbonde  was a reuelour
This is to seyn  he hadde a paramour
And I was yong and ful of ragerye
Stibourne and strong and ioly as a pye
  
Wel koude I daunce  to an harpe smale
And synge ywis  as any nyghtyngale
Whan I had dronke  a draughte of sweete wyn
Metellius  the foule cherl the swyn
That with a staf  birafte his wyf hire lyf
ffor she drank wyn  thogh I hadde been his wyf 
He sholde nat han daunted me fro drynke
And after wyn  on Venus moste I thynke
ffor al so siker  as cold engendreth hayl  
A likerous mouth  moste han a likerous tayl
In wommen vinolent  is no defence
This knowen lecchours by experience
 But lord crist  whan that it remembreth me
Vpon my yowthe  and on my Iolitee
It tikleth me  aboute myn herte roote
Vnto this day  it dooth myn herte boote
That I haue had my world  as in my tyme
But Age allas  that al wole enuenyme
Hath me biraft  my beautee  and my pith
Lat go fare wel  the deuel go therwith
The flour is goon  ther is namoore to telle
The bren as I best kan  now moste I selle
But yet to be right myrie  wol I fonde
Now wol I tellen  of my fourthe housbonde
 I seye  I hadde in herte greet despit
That he  of any oother had delit
But he was quit by god  and by seint Ioce
I made hym  of the same wode a croce
Nat of my body  in no foul manere
But certein  I made folk swich cheere
That in his owene grece  I made hym frye
ffor Angre  and for verray Ialousye
By god  in erthe I was his purgatorie
ffor which I hope  his soule be in glorie
ffor god it woot he sat ful ofte and song 
Whan þat his shoo  ful bitterly hym wrong
  
Ther was no wight saue god and he þat wiste
In many wise  how soore I hym twiste
He deyde  whan I cam fro Ierusalem
And lith ygraue  vnder the roode beem
Al is his tombe  noght so curyus
As was the sepulcre  of hym Daryus
Which that Appelles  wroghte subtilly
It nys but wast to burye hym preciously
Lat hym fare wel  god yeue his soule reste
He is now  in his graue  and in his cheste
NOw  of my fifthe housbonde wol I telle
God lete his soule  neuere come in helle
And yet was he to me  the mooste shrewe
That feele I  on my ribbes al by rewe
And euere shal  vnto myn endyng day
But in oure bed  he was  ful fressh and gay
And therwithal  so wel koude he me glose
Whan that he wolde han my bele chose
That thogh  he hadde me bet on euery bon
He koude wynne  agayn my loue anon
I trowe I loued hym best for that he  
Was of his loue  daungerous to me
We wommen han  if that I shal nat lye
In this matere  a queynte fantasye
Wayte what thyng we may nat lightly haue
Ther after  wol we crie  al day and craue
fforbede vs thyng and that desiren we
Preesse on vs faste  and thanne wol we fle
With daunger  oute we al oure chaffare
Greet prees at Market maketh deere ware
And to greet cheepe  is holde at litel prys
This knoweth  euery womman that is wys
 My fifthe housbonde  god his soule blesse
Which þat I took for loue  and no richesse
He som tyme  was a clerk of Oxenford
And hadde left scole  and wente at hom to bord
  
With my gossib  dwellynge in oure toun
God haue hir soule  hir name was Alisoun
She knew myn herte  and eek my priuetee
Bet than oure parisshe preest as moot I thee
To hire  biwreyed I  my conseil al
ffor hadde myn housbonde  pissed on a wal
Or doon a thyng þat sholde han cost his lyf 
To hire  and to another worthy wyf 
And to my Nece  which þat I loued weel
I wolde han toold  his conseil euery deel
And so I dide  ful often god it woot
That made his face  ful often reed and hoot
ffor verray shame  and blamed hym self for he
Had toold to me  so greet a pryuetee
 And so bifel  that ones in a lente
So often tymes  I to my gossyb wente
ffor euere yet I loued to be gay
And for to walke  in March  Auerill and May
ffro hous to hous  to heere sondry talys
That Iankyn Clerk and my gossyb dame Alys
And I my self  into the feeldes wente
Myn housbonde  was at London al the lente
I hadde  the bettre leyser for to pleye
And for to se  and eek for to be seye
Of lusty folk what wiste I  wher my grace
Was shapen for to be  or in what place
Therfore  I made my visitacions
To vigilies  and to processions
To prechyng eek and to thise pilgrimages
To pleyes of myracles  and to mariages
And wered vpon  my gaye scarlet gytes
Thise wormes  ne thise Motthes  ne thise mytes
Vpon my peril  frete hem neuer a deel  
And wostow why for they were vsed weel
NOw wol I tellen forth  what happed me
I seye  that in the feeldes walked we
  
Till trewely  we hadde swich daliance
This clerk and I  that of my purueiance
I spak to hym  and seyde hym  how þat he
If I were wydwe  sholde wedde me
ffor certeinly  I sey for no bobance
Yet was I neuere  withouten purueiance
Of mariage  nof othere thynges eek
I holde a Mouses herte  nat worth a leek
That hath but oon hole  for to sterte to
And if þat faille  thanne is al ydo
 I bar hym on honde  he hadde enchanted me
My dame taughte me that soutiltee
And eek I seyde  I mette of hym al nyght
He wolde han slayn me  as I lay vp right
And al my bed  was ful of verray blood
But yet I hope  that he shal do me good
ffor blood  bitokeneth gold  as me was taught
And al was fals  I dremed of it right naught
But I folwed ay  my dammes loore
As wel of this  as of othere thynges moore
 But now sire  lat me se  what I shal seyn
A  ha  by god  I haue my tale ageyn
 Whan þat my fourthe housbonde  was on beere
I weepe algate  and made sory cheere
As wyues mooten  for it is vsage
And with my couerchief  couered my visage
But for þat I  was purueyed of a make
I wepte but smal  and that I vndertake
 To chirche  was myn housbonde  born a morwe
With neighebores  that for hym maden sorwe
And Iankyn oure Clerk  was oon of tho
As help me god  whan þat I saugh hym go
After the beere  me thoughte he hadde a paire
Of legges  and of feet  so clene and faire
That al myn herte  I yaf vnto his hoold
He was I trowe  a twenty wynter oold
  
And I was fourty  if I shal seye sooth
But yet I hadde alwey  a coltes tooth
Gat tothed I was  and that bicam me weel
I hadde the prente  of seint Venus seel
As help me god  I was a lusty oon
And faire and riche  and yong and wel bigon
And trewely  as myne housbondes tolde me
I hadde the beste Quonyam myghte be
ffor certes  I am al Venerien  
In feelynge  and myn herte is Marcien
Venus me yaf my lust my likerousnesse
And Mars yaf me  my sturdy hardynesse
Myn Ascendent was Taur and Mars therInne
Allas  allas  þat euere loue was synne
I folwed ay  myn Inclinacion
By vertu  of my constellacion
That made me  I koude noght withdrawe
My chambre of Venus  from a good felawe
Yet haue I  Martes Mark vpon my face
And also  in another priuee place
ffor god so wys  be my sauacion
I ne loued neuere  by no discrecion
But euere  folwed myn appetit
Al were he  short or long or blak  or whit
I took no kepe  so that he liked me
How poore he was  ne eek of what degree
 What sholde I seye  but at the Monthes ende
This ioly clerk Iankyn þat was so hende
Hath wedded me  with greet solempnytee
And to hym yaf I  al the lond and fee
That euere  was me yeuen therbifoore
But afterward  repented me ful soore
He nolde suffre  nothyng of my list
By god  he smoot me ones on the lyst
ffor þat I rente  out of his book a leef 
That of the strook  myn ere wax al deef 
  
Stibourne I was  as is a Leonesse
And of my tonge  a verray Iangleresse
And walke I wolde  as I had doon biforn
ffrom hous to hous  although he had it sworn
ffor which  he often tymes wolde preche
And me  of olde Romayn geestes teche
How he symplicius Gallus  lefte his wyf
And hire forsok  for terme of al his lyf
Noght but for openheueded  he hir say
Lokynge out at his dore  vpon a day
 Another Romayn  tolde he me by name
That for his wyf  was at a someres game
Withouten his wityng he forsook hire eke
And thanne wolde he  vpon his Bible seke
That ilke prouerbe  of Ecclesiaste
Where he comandeth  and forbedeth faste
Man shal nat suffre his wyf go roule aboute
Thanne wolde he seye right thus  withouten doute
 Who so  that buyldeth his hous  al of salwes
And priketh his blynde hors  ouer the falwes
 And suffreth his wyf  to go seken halwes  
Is worthy  to been hanged  on the galwes
But al for noght I sette noght an hawe
Of his prouerbes  nof his olde awe
Ne I wolde nat of hym corrected be
I hate hym  that my vices telleth me
And so doo mo  god woot of vs  than I
This made hym  with me wood al outrely
I nolde noght  forbere hym in no cas
 Now wol I seye yow sooth  by seint Thomas
Why þat I rente  out of his book a leef
ffor which  he smoot me so  þat I was deef
 He hadde a book  þat gladly nyght and day
ffor his desport he wolde rede alway
He cleped it Valerie  and Theofraste
At which book he lough alwey ful faste
  
 And eek ther was som tyme  a clerk at Rome
A Cardinal  that highte Seint Ierome
That made a book agayn Iouinian
In which book eek ther was Tertulan
Crisippus  Trotula  and Helowys
That was Abbesse  nat fer fro Parys
And eek the Parables of Salomon
Ouides Art and bookes many on
And alle thise  were bounden  in o volume
And euery nyght and day  was his custume
Whan he hadde leyser  and vacacion
ffrom oother  worldly  occupacion
To reden on this book  of wikked wyues
He knew of hem  mo legendes and lyues
Than been  of goode wyues in the Bible
ffor trusteth wel  it is an impossible
That any clerk wol speke good of wyues
But if it be  of hooly seintes lyues
Ne noon oother womman  neuer the mo
Who peynted the leon  tel me who
By god  if wommen  hadde writen stories
As clerkes han  withInne hire oratories
They wolde han writen  of men moore wikkednesse
Than all the mark of Adam may redresse
The children  of Mercurie and Venus
Been in hir wirkyng ful contrarius
Mercurie  loueth wysdam and science
And Venus  loueth ryot and dispence
And for hire diuerse disposicion
Ech falleth  in otheres exaltacion
And thus god woot Mercurie is desolat
In Pisces  wher Venus is exaltat
And Venus falleth  ther Mercurie is reysed  
Therfore no womman  of no clerk is preysed
The clerk whan he is oold  and may noght do
Of Venus werkes  worth his olde sho
  
Thanne sit he doun  and writ in his dotage
That wommen  kan nat kepe hir mariage
But now to purpos  why I tolde thee
That I was beten  for a book pardee
Vpon a nyght Iankyn þat was oure sire
Redde on his book  as he sat by the fire
Of Eua first that for hir wikkednesse
Was al mankynde  broght to wrecchednesse
ffor which crist hym self was slayn
That boghte vs  with his herte blood agayn
Lo heere expres  of womman may ye fynde
That womman  was the los  of al mankynde
 Tho redde he me  how Sampson loste hise heres
Slepynge  his lemman  kitte it with hir sheres
Thurgh which treson  loste he bothe hise eyen
 Tho redde he me  if that I shal nat lyen
Of Hercules  and of his Dianyre
That caused hym  to sette hymself afyre
 No thyng forgat he  the sorwe and wo
That Socrates  hadde with hise wyues two
How Xantippa  caste pisse vpon his heed
This sely man  sat stille as he were deed
He wiped his heed  namoore dorste he seyn
But er þat thonder stynte  comth a reyn
 Of Phasifpha  that was the queene of Crete
ffor shrewednesse  hym thoughte the tale swete
ffy speke namoore  it is a grisly thyng
Of hire  horrible lust and hir likyng
 Of Clitermystra  for hire lecherye
That falsly  made hire housbonde for to dye
He redde it with ful good deuocion
 He tolde me eek for what occasion
Amphiorax  at Thebes loste his lyf
Myn housbonde  hadde a legende of his wyf 
 Eriphilem  that for an Ouche of gold
Hath priuely  vnto the grekes told
  
Wher that hir housbonde  hidde hym in a place
ffor which  he hadde at Thebes sory grace
 Of Lyma tolde he me  and of Lucye
They bothe  made hir housbondes for to dye
That oon for loue  that oother was for hate
Lyma hir housbonde  vpon an euen late
Empoysoned hath  for þat she was his fo
Lucia likerous  loued hire housbonde so
That for he sholde  alwey vpon hire thynke  
She yaf hym  swich a manere loue drynke
That he was deed  er it were by the morwe
And thus algates  housbondes han sorw
 Thanne tolde he me  how þat oon Latumyus
Compleyned  vnto his felawe Arrius
That in his gardyn  growed swich a tree
On which he seyde  how that hise wyues thre
Hanged hem self for herte despitus
 O leeue brother  quod this Arrius
Yif me a plante  of thilke blissed tree
And in my gardyn  planted it shal bee
 Of latter date of wyues  hath he red
That somme  han slayn hir housbondes in hir bed
And lete hir lecchour  dighte hire al the nyght
Whan that the corps  lay in the floor vp right
 And somme  han dryue nayles  in hir brayn
Whil þat they slepte  and thus they han hem slayn
 Somme han hem yeue  poysoun in hire drynke
He spak moore harm  than herte may bithynke
And therwithal  he knew of mo prouerbes
Than in this world  ther growen gras or herbes
Bet is quod he  thyn habitacioun
Be with a leoun  or a foul dragoun
Than with a womman  vsynge for to chyde
Bet is quod he  hye in the roof abyde
Than with an angry wyf  doun in the hous
They been so wikked and contrarious
  
They haten  that hir housbondes  loueth ay
He seyde  a womman cast hir shame away
Whan she cast of hir smok and forther mo
A fair womman  but she be chaast also
Is lyk a gold ryng in a sowes nose
Who wolde leeue  or who wolde suppose
The wo  that in myn herte was and pyne
 And whan I saugh  he wolde neuere fyne
To reden on this cursed book al nyght
Al sodeynly  thre leues haue I plyght
Out of his book right as he radde  and eke
I with my fest so took hym on the cheke
That in oure fyr  he fil bakward adoun
And he vp stirte  as dooth a wood leoun
And with his fest he smoot me on the heed
That in the floor  I lay  as I were deed
And whan he saugh  how stille þat I lay
He was agast and wolde han fled his way
Til atte laste  out of my swogh I breyde
O hastow slayn me  false theef I seyde
And for my land  thus hastow mordred me  
Er I be deed  yet wol I kisse thee
 And neer he cam  and kneled faire adoun
And seyde  deere suster Alisoun
As help me god  I shal thee neuere smyte
That I haue doon  it is thy self to wyte
fforyeue it me  and that I thee biseke
And yet eft soones  I hitte hym on the cheke
And seyde theef thus muchel am I wreke
Now wol I dye  I may no lenger speke
But atte laste  with muchel care and wo
We fille acorded  by vs seluen two
He yaf me  al the bridel in myn hond
To han the gouernance  of hous and lond
And of his tonge  and his hond also
And made hym brenne his book anon right tho
  
And whan that I  hadde geten vnto me
By maistrie  al the soueraynetee
And that he seyde  myn owene trewe wyf
Do as thee lust to terme of al thy lyf
Keepe thyn honour  and keepe eek myn estaat
After that day  we hadden neuer debaat
God helpe me so  I was to hym as kynde
As any wyf from Denmark vnto Ynde
And also trewe  and so was he to me
I prey to god  that sit in magestee
So blesse his soule  for his mercy deere
Now wol I seye my tale  if ye wol heere
The frere lough  whan he hadde herd al this
Now dame quod he  so haue I ioye or blis
This is  a long preamble of a tale
And whan the Somonour  herde the frere gale
 Lo quod the Somonour  goddes Armes two
A frere  wol entremette him eueremo
Lo goode men  a flye and eek a frere
Wol falle  in euery dyssh and mateere
What spekestow  of preambulacioun
What amble  or trotte  or pees  or go sit doun
Thou lettest oure disport in this manere
 Ye woltow so  sire Somonour quod the frere
Now by my feith  I shal er that I go
Telle of a Somonour  swich a tale or two
That alle the folk shal laughen in this place
 Now elles frere  I bishrewe thy face
Quod this Somonour and I bishrewe me  
But if I telle tales  two or thre
Of freres  er I come to Sidyngborne
That I shal make  thyn herte for to morne
  
ffor wel I woot thy pacience is gon
 Oure hoost cride pees  and that anon
And seyde  lat the womman telle hire tale
Ye fare as folk  that dronken were of Ale
Do dame  telle forth youre tale  and that is best
 Al redy sire quod she  right as yow lest
If I haue licence  of this worthy frere
 Yis dame quod he  tel forth  and I wol heere
IN tholde dayes  of Kyng Arthour
Of which that Britons  speken greet honour
All was this land  fulfild of ffairye
The Elf queene  with hir ioly compaignye
Daunced ful ofte  in many a grene mede
This was the olde opinion as I rede
I speke  of manye hundred yeres ago
But now kan no man  se none Elues mo
ffor now the grete charitee  and prayeres
Of lymytours  and othere hooly freres
That serchen  euery lond  and euery streem
As thikke  as motes  in the sonne beem
Blessynge halles  chambres  kichenes  boures
Citees  Burghes  Castels  hye Toures
Thropes  Bernes  Shipnes  dayeryes
This maketh  that ther been no ffairyes
ffor ther as wont to walken was an Elf
Ther walketh now  the lymytour hym self
In vndermeles  and in morwenynges
And seyth his matyns  and his hooly thynges
As he gooth  in his lymytacioun
Wommen  may go saufly vp and doun
In euery bussh  or vnder euery tree
Ther is  noon oother Incubus  but he
And he  ne wol doon hem  but dishonour
 And so bifel  that this kyng Arthour
Hadde in hous  a lusty Bacheler
That on a day  cam ridynge fro Ryuer
  
And happed that allone  as he was born
He saugh a mayde  walkynge hym biforn
Of which mayde  anon maugree hir heed  
By verray force  birafte hire maydenhed
ffor which oppression  was swich clamour
And swich pursute  vnto the kyng Arthour
That dampned was this knyght for to be deed
By cours of lawe  and sholde han lost his heed
Parauenture  swich was the statut tho
But that the queene  and othere ladyes mo
So longe preyden  the kyng of grace
Til he  his lyf  hym graunted in the place
And yaf hym to the queene  al at hir wille
To chese  wheither  she wolde hym saue or spille
 The queene  thanketh the kyng with al hir myght
And after this  thus spak she to the knyght
Whan þat she saugh hir tyme vpon a day
Thou standest yet quod she  in swich array
That of thy lyf  yet hastow no suretee
I grante thee lyf  if thou kanst tellen me
What thyng is it that wommen moost desiren
Be war  and keepe thy nekke boon from Iren
And if thou  kanst nat tellen it anon
Yet shal I yeue thee leue  for to gon
A twelfmonth and a day  to seche and leere
An answere suffisant in this mateere
And suretee wol I han  er þat thou pace
Thy body  for to yelden in this place
WO was this knyght and sorwefully he siketh
But he may nat do  al as hym liketh
And at the laste  he chees hym for to wende
And come agayn  right at the yeres ende
With swich answere  as god wolde hym purueye
And taketh his leue  and wendeth forth his weye
 He seketh  euery hous  and euery place
Where as he hopeth  for to fynde grace
  
To lerne  what thyng wommen louen moost
But he ne koude  arryuen in no coost
Wher as he myghte fynde  in this mateere
Two creatures  accordynge in feere
 Somme seyde  wommen  louen best richesse
Somme seyde honour  somme seyde Iolynesse
Somme riche array  somme seyden lust abedd
And ofte tyme  to be wydwe and wedde
 Somme seyde  þat oure hertes  been moost esed
Whan that we been  yflatered and yplesed
 He gooth ful ny the sothe  I wol nat lye
A man  shal wynne vs best with flaterye
And with attendance  and with bisynesse
Been we ylymed  bothe moore and lesse
 And somme seyn  that we louen best  
ffor to be free  and do right as vs lest
And that no man  repreue vs of oure vice
But seye þat we be wise  and no thyng nyce
ffor trewely  ther is noon of vs alle
If any wight  wol clawe vs on the galle
That we nel kike  for he seith vs sooth
Assay  and he shal fynde it þat so dooth
ffor be we  neuer so vicious withInne
We wol been holden wise  and clene of synne
 And somme seyn  that greet delit han we
ffor to been holden stable  and eke secree
And in o purpos  stedefastly to dwelle
And nat biwreye thyng that men vs telle
But that tale  is nat worth a rake stele
Pardee we wommen  konne no thyng hele
Witnesse on Myda  wol ye heere the tale
 Ouyde  amonges othere thynges smale
Seyde  Myda hadde vnder his longe heres
Growynge vpon his heed  two Asses eres
The which vice he hydde  as he best myghte
fful subtilly  from euery mannes sighte
  
That saue his wyf  ther wiste of it namo
He loued hire moost and triste hire also
He preyde hire  that to no creature
She sholde tellen  of his disfigure
 She swoor him nay  for al this world to wynne
She nolde do  that vileynye or synne
To make hir housbonde  han so foul a name
She nolde nat telle it for hir owene shame
But nathelees  hir thoughte þat she dyde
That she so longe  sholde a conseil hyde
Hir thoughte  it swal so soore  aboute hir herte
That nedely  som word hire moste asterte
And sith she dorste  telle it to no man
Doun to a Mareys  faste by she ran
Til she came there  her herte was a fyre
And as a Bitore  bombleth in the Myre
She leyde hir mouth  vnto the water doun
Biwreye me nat thou water with thy soun
Quod she  to thee I telle it and namo
Myn housbonde  hath longe Asses erys two
Now is myn herte all hool  now is it oute
I myghte no lenger  kepe it out of doute
Heere may ye se  thogh we a tyme abyde
Yet out it moot we kan no conseil hyde
The remenant of the tale  if ye wol heere
Redeth Ouyde  and ther ye may it leere
THis knyght  of which  my tale is specially  
Whan that he saugh  he myghte nat come therby
This is to seye  what wommen loue moost
WithInne his brest ful sorweful was the goost
But hoom he gooth  he myghte nat soiourne
The day was come  þat homward moste he tourne
And in his wey  it happed hym to ryde
In al this care  vnder a fforest syde
Wher as he saugh  vpon a daunce go
Of ladyes  foure and twenty  and yet mo
  
Toward the which daunce  he drow ful yerne
In hope  that som wysdom  sholde he lerne
But certeinly  er he came fully there
Vanysshed was this daunce  he nyste where
No creature saugh he  that bar lyf
Saue on the grene  he saugh sittynge a wyf
A fouler wight ther may no man deuyse
Agayn the knyght this olde wyf gan ryse
And seyde sire knyght  heer forth ne lith no wey
Tel me  what that ye seken  by youre fey
Parauenture  it may the bettre be
Thise olde folk kan muchel thyng quod she

 Haue heer my trouthe  quod the knyght I grante

Vpon my lyf the queene wol seye as I
Lat se  which is the proudeste of hem alle
That wereth on  a couerchief or a calle
That dar seye nay  of that I shal thee teche
Lat vs go forth  withouten lenger speche
Tho rowned she  a pistel in his ere
And bad hym to be glad  and haue no fere
 Whan they be comen to the court  this knyght
Seyde  he had holde his day  as he hadde hight
And redy was his answere  as he sayde
fful many a noble wyf  and many a mayde
And many a wydwe  for þat they been wise
The queene hirself sittynge as Iustise
  
Assembled been  his answere for to heere
And afterward  this knyght was bode appeere
 To euery wight  comanded was silence  
And that the knyght  sholde telle in Audience
What thyng that worldly wommen louen best
This knyght ne stood nat stille  as doth a best
But to his questioun  anon answerde
With manly voys  that al the court it herde
 My lige lady  generally  quod he
Wommen desiren haue souereynetee
As wel  ouer hir housbond as hir loue
And for to been  in maistrie hym aboue
This is youre mooste desir  thogh ye me kille
Dooth as yow list I am at youre wille
 In al the court ne was ther wyf ne mayde
Ne wydwe  that contraried that he sayde
But seyden  he was worthy han his lyf
 And with that word  vp stirte the olde wyf
Which that the knyght  saugh sittynge in the grene
Mercy quod she my souereyn lady queene
Er that youre court departe  do me right
I taughte this answere  vnto the knyght
ffor which  he plighte me his trouthe there
The firste thyng I wolde hym requere
He wolde it do  if it lay in his myght
Bifore the court  thanne preye I thee sir knyght
Quod she  that thou me take vnto thy wyf
ffor wel thou woost that I haue kept thy lyf
If I sey fals  sey nay vpon thy fey
 This knyght answerde  allas and weylawey
I woot right wel  that swich was my biheste
ffor goddes loue  as chees a newe requeste
Taak al my good  and lat my body go
 Nay thanne quod she  I shrewe vs bothe two
ffor thogh that I be foul  oold and poore
I nolde for al the metal  ne for oore
  
That vnder erthe is graue  or lith aboue
But if thy wyf I were  and eek thy loue
 My loue quod he nay my dampnacion
Allas  that any of my nacion
Sholde euere so foule  disparaged be
But al for noght thende is this  that he
Constreyned was  he nedes moste hire wedde
And taketh his olde wyf  and gooth to bedde
 Now wolden som men  seye parauenture
That for my necligence  I do no cure
To tellen yow  the ioye  and al tharray
That at the feeste was  that ilke day
To which thyng shortly answere I shal
I seye  ther nas no ioye  ne feeste at al
Ther nas but heuynesse  and muche sorwe  
ffor priuely  he wedded hire on a morwe
And al day after  hidde hym as an Owle
So wo was hym  his wyf looked so foule
 Greet was the wo  the knyght hadde in his thoght
Whan he was with his wyf abedde ybroght
He walweth  and he turneth to and fro
His olde wyf  lay smylynge eueremo
And seyde  o deere housbonde benedicitee
ffareth euery knyght  thus with his wyf  as ye
Is this the lawe  of kyng Arthures hous
Is euery knyght of his so dangerous
I am youre owene loue  and youre wyf
I am she  which þat saued hath youre lyf
And certes  yet ne dide I yow neuere vnright
Why fare ye thus with me  this firste nyght
Ye faren lyk a man  had lost his wit
What is my gilt for goddes loue tel it
And it shal been amended  if I may
 Amended quod this knyght allas  nay  nay 
It wol nat been amended neuere mo
Thou art so loothly  and so oold also
  
And therto comen  of so lough a kynde
That litel wonder is  thogh I walwe and wynde
So wolde god  myn herte wolde breste
 Is this quod she  the cause of youre vnreste
 Ye certeinly quod he  no wonder is
 Now sire quod she  I koude amende al this
If that me liste  er it were dayes thre
So wel ye myghte  bere yow vnto me
Bvt for ye speken  of swich gentillesse
As is descended  out of old richesse
That therfore  sholden ye be gentil men
Swich arrogance  is nat worth an hen
Looke  who that is  moost vertuous alway
Pryuee and apert and moost entendeth ay
To do  the gentil dedes that he kan
Taak hym  for the grettest 1gentil man1
Crist wole  we clayme of hym oure gentillesse
Nat of oure eldres  for hire old richesse
ffor thogh they yeue vs  al hir heritage
ffor which we clayme  to been of heigh parage
Yet may they nat biquethe  for no thyng
To noon of vs  hir vertuous lyuyng
That made hem  gentil men ycalled be
And bad vs  folwen hem in swich degree
 Wel kan  the wise Poete of fflorence
That highte Dant speken in this sentence
 Lo  in swich maner rym  is Dantes tale  
fful selde vp riseth  by his branches smale
Prowesse of man  for god of his goodnesse
Wole  that of hym  we clayme oure gentillesse
ffor of oure eldres  may we no thyng clayme
But temporel thyng þat man may hurte and mayme
 Eek euery wight woot this as wel as I
If gentillesse  were planted natureelly
Vnto a certeyn lynage  doun the lyne
Pryuee nor apert thanne wolde they neuere fyne
  
To doon of gentillesse  the faire office
They myghte do  no vileynye or vice
 Taak fyr  and ber it in the derkeste hous
Bitwix this  and the mount of Kaukasous
And lat men  shette the dores and go thenne
Yet wole the fyr  as faire lye and brenne
As twenty thousand men  myghte it biholde
His office natureel  ay wol it holde
Vp peril of my lyf  til that it dye
 Heere may ye se wel  how þat genterye
Is nat annexed to possession
Sith folk  ne doon hir operacion
Alwey as dooth the fyr  lo in his kynde
ffor god it woot men may wel often fynde
A lordes sone  do shame and vileynye
And he þat wole  han pris of his gentrye
ffor he was born  of a gentil hous
And hadde hise eldres  nobel and vertuous
And nel hym seluen  do no gentil dedis
Ne folwen his gentil Auncestre þat deed is
He nys nat gentil  be he duc or Erl
ffor vileyns synful dedes  make a cherl
ffor gentillesse  nys but renomee
Of thyne auncestres  for hire heigh bountee
Which is a strange thyng to thy persone
Thy gentillesse  cometh fro god allone
Thanne comth  oure verray gentillesse of grace
It was no thyng  biquethe vs with oure place
 Thenketh hou noble  as seith Valerius
Was thilke  Tullius Hostillius
That out of pouerte  roos to heigh noblesse
Reed senek  and redeth eek Boece
Ther shul ye seen expres  þat no drede is
That he is gentil  that dooth gentil dedis
And therfore leeue housbonde  I thus conclude
Al were it  that myne Auncestres weren rude
  
Yet may the hye god  and so hope I
Grante me grace  to lyuen vertuously
Thanne am I gentil  whan that I bigynne  
To lyuen vertuously  and weyue synne
ANd ther as ye  of pouerte me repreeue
The hye god  on whom þat we bileeue
In wilful pouerte  chees to lyue his lyf
And certes  euery man  mayden or wyf
May vnderstonde  that Ihesus heuene kyng
Ne wolde nat chesen vicious lyuyng
Glad pouerte  is an honeste thyng certeyn
This wole Senec and othere clerkes seyn
Who so þat halt hym payd of his pouerte
I holde hym riche  al hadde he nat a sherte
He þat coueiteth  is a pouere wight
ffor he wolde han  that is nat in his myght
But he þat noght hath  ne coueiteth haue
Is riche  although ye holde hym but a knaue
 Verray pouerte  it syngeth proprely
Iuuenal  seith of pouerte myrily
The poure man  whan he goth by the weye
Bifore the theues  he may synge and pleye
Pouerte is hateful good  and as I gesse
A ful greet bryngere  out of bisynesse
A greet amendere eek of sapience
To hym  that taketh it in pacience
Pouerte is this  although it seme alenge
Possession  that no wight wol chalenge
Pouerte ful ofte  whan a man is lowe
Maketh his god  and eek hym self to knowe
Pouerte  a spectacle is  as thynketh me
Thurgh which he may  hise verray freendes see
And therfore sire  syn þat I noght yow greue
Of my pouerte  namoore ye me repreue
NOw sire  of elde  ye repreue me
And certes sire  thogh noon Auctoritee  
Were in no book  ye gentils of honour
Seyn  þat men sholde  an oold wight doon fauour
And clepe hym fader  for youre gentillesse
And Auctours  shal I fynden as I gesse
NOw ther ye seye  þat I am foul and old
Than drede you noght  to been a Cokewold
ffor filthe and eelde  al so moot I thee
Been grete wardeyns  vpon chastitee
But nathelees  syn I knowe youre delit
I shal fulfille  youre worldly appetit
 Chese now quod she  oon of thise thynges tweye
To han me foul and old  til that I deye
And be to yow  a trewe humble wyf
And neuere yow displese  in al my lyf
Or elles  ye wol han me yong and fair  
And take youre auenture  of the repair
That shal be to youre hous  by cause of me
Or in som oother place  may wel be
Now chese your seluen  wheither þat yow liketh
 This knyght auyseth hym and sore siketh
But atte laste  he seyde in this manere
My lady and my loue  and wyf so deere
I put me  in youre wise gouernance
Cheseth youre self  which may be moost plesance
And moost honour  to yow and me also
I do no fors  the wheither of the two
ffor as yow liketh  it suffiseth me
 Thanne haue I gete of yow  maistrie quod she
Syn I may chese  and gouerne as me lest
 Ye certes wyf quod he  I holde it best
 Kys me quod she  we be no lenger wrothe
ffor by my trouthe  I wol be to yow bothe
This is to seyn  ye bothe fair and good
I prey to god  þat I moote steruen wood
But I to yow  be al so good and trewe
As euere was wyf  syn þat the world was newe
  
And but I be tomorn  as fair to seene
As any lady  Emperice or queene
That is bitwixe the Est and eke the West
Dooth with my lyf  and deth  right as yow lest
Cast vp the curtyn  looke how that it is
 And whan the knyght saugh verraily al this
That she so fair was  and so yong therto
ffor ioye  he hente hire  in hise armes two
His herte bathed  in a bath of blisse
A thousand tyme arewe  he gan hire kisse
And she obeyed hym in euery thyng
That myghte doon hym plesance or likyng
 And thus they lyue  vnto hir lyues ende
In parfit ioye  and Ihesu crist vs sende
Housbondes meeke  yonge  fressh a bedde
And grace  touerbyde hem þat we wedde
And eek  I pray Ihesu shorte hir lyues
That nat wol be gouerned by hir wyues
And olde and angry nygardes of dispence
God sende hem soone  verray pestilence
THis worthy lymytour  this noble frere
He made alwey  a maner louryng chiere
Vpon the Somonour  but for honestee
No vileyns word  as yet to hym spak he
But atte laste  he seyde vnto the wyf
Dame quod he  god yeue yow right good lyf
Ye han heer touched  al so moot I thee
In scole matere  greet difficultee
Ye han seyd muche thyng right wel I seye
But dame  heere as we ryde by the weye
Vs nedeth nat to speken but of game
And lete  auctoritees  on goddes name
To prechyng and to scole of clergye
And if it lyke  to this compaignye
I wol yow  of a somonour telle a game
Pardee  ye may wel knowe by the name
That of a Somonour  may no good be sayd
I praye  þat noon of you  be yuele apayd
A Somonour  is a rennere vp and doun
With mandementz  for fornicacioun
And is ybet at euery townes ende
 Oure hoost tho spak  a sire ye sholde be hende
And curteys  as a man of youre estaat
In compaignye  we wol haue no debaat
Telleth youre tale  and lat the Somonour be
 Nay quod the Somonour  lat hym seye to me
What so hym list whan it comth to my lot
By god  I shal hym quiten euery grot
I shal hym tellen  which a greet honour
It is  to be a flaterynge lymytour
And of many another manere cryme
Which nedeth nat rehercen for this tyme
And his office  I shal hym telle ywis
 Oure hoost answerde  pees namoore of this
And after this  he seyde vnto the frere
Tel forth youre tale  leeue maister deere

WHilom ther was dwellynge  in my contree
An Erchedekene  a man of heigh degree
That boldely  dide execucioun
In punysshynge  of fornicacioun
Of wicchecraft and eek of bawderye  
Of diffamacioun  and Auowtrye
Of chirche Reues  and of testamentz
Of contractes  and eek of lakke of sacramentz
Of vsure  and of Symonye also
But certes  lecchours dide he grettest wo
They sholde syngen  if þat they were hent
And smale tytheres  weren foule yshent
If any persone  wolde vpon hem pleyne
Ther myghte asterte hym  no pecunyal peyne
ffor smale tithes  and smal offrynge
He made the peple  pitously to synge
ffor er the bisshope  caughte hym with his hook
They were in the Erchedeknes book
And thanne  hadde he  thurgh his Iurisdiccion
Power  to doon on hem correccion
He hadde a Somonour  redy to his hond
A slyer boye  was noon in Engelond
ffor subtilly  he hadde his espiaille
That taughte hym  wher hym myghte auaille
He koude spare of lecchours  oon or two
To techen hym  to foure and twenty mo
ffor thogh this somonour  wood was as an hare
To telle his harlotrye  I wol nat spare
  
ffor we been  out of his correccion
They han of vs no Iurisdiccion
Ne neuere shullen  terme of hir lyues
 Peter  so been  wommen of the styves
Quod the Somonour  yput out of my cure
 Pees with myschance  and with mysauenture
Thus seyde oure hoost and lat hym telle his tale
Now telleth forth  thogh þat the somonour gale
Ne spareth nat  myn owene maister deere
 This false theef this Somonour quod the frere
Hadde alwey  bawdes redy to his hond
As any hauk to lure in Engelond
That tolde hym  al the secree þat they knewe
ffor hire acqueyntance  was nat come of newe
They weren  hise approwours priuely
He took hym self  a greet profit therby
His maister knew nat  alwey  what he wan
Withouten mandement  a lewed man
He koude somne  on peyne of Cristes curs
And they were glade  for to fille his purs
And make hym  grete feestes atte nale
And right as Iudas  hadde purses smale
And was a theef right swich a theef was he
His maister hadde  but half his duetee
He was  if I shal yeuen hym his laude  
A theef  and eek  a Somnour  and a baude
He hadde eek wenches  at his retenue
That wheither  þat sir Robert or sir Huwe
Or Iakke  or Rauf  or who so þat it were
That lay by hem  they tolde it in his ere
 Thus was the wenche and he  of oon assent
And he wolde fecche  a feyned mandement
And somne hem to the Chapitre bothe two
And pile the man  and lete the wenche go
 Thanne wolde he seye  freend I shal for thy sake
Do striken hire  out of oure lettres blake
  
Thee thar namoore  as in this cas trauaille
I am thy freend  ther I thee may auaille
Certeyn  he knew of bribryes mo
Than possible is  to telle in yeres two
ffor in this world  nys dogge for the bowe
That kan an hurt deer  from an hool knowe
Bet  than this Somnour  knew a sly lecchour
Or an Auowtier  or a paramour
And for that was  the fruyt of al his rente
Therfore on it he sette al his entente
 And so bifel  that ones on a day
This Somnour  euere waityng on his pray
ffor to somne an old wydwe a Ribibe
ffeynynge a cause  for he wolde brybe
Happed  that he saugh bifore hym ryde
A gay yeman  vnder a fforest syde
A bowe he bar  and Arwes brighte and kene
He hadde vpon  a courtepy of grene
An hat vpon his heed  with frenges blake
 Sire quod this Somnour  hayl and wel atake
Wel come quod he  and euery good felawe
Wher rydestow  vnder this grene wode shawe
Seyde this yeman  wiltow fer to day
 This Somnour hym answerde  and seyde nay
Heere faste by quod he  is myn entente
To ryden  for to reysen vp a rente
That longeth  to my lordes duetee
 Artow thanne a bailly Ye quod he

Seye þat he was a somonour  for the name
 Depardieux quod this yeman  deere broother

Of thyn aqueyntance  I wolde praye thee
And eek of bretherhede  if þat yow leste

And euere enqueryng vpon euery thyng

And spareth nat for conscience ne synne
But as my brother  tel me  how do ye
 Now by my trouthe  brother deere seyde he
As I shal tellen thee  a feithful tale

My lord is hard to me  and daungerous
And myn office  is ful laborous
And therfore  by extorcions I lyue
ffor sothe  I take all that men wol me yeue
Algate  by sleyghte  or by violence
ffro yeer to yeer  I wynne al my dispence
I kan no bettre telle  feithfully
 Now certes quod this Somonour  so fare I

But if it be  to heuy or to hoot
  
What I may gete  in conseil priuely
No maner conscience  of that haue I
Nere myn extorcioun  I myghte nat lyuer
Nor of swiche Iapes  wol I nat be shryuen
Stomak  ne conscience  ne knowe I noon

Wel be we met by god  and by seint Iame
But leeue brother  tel me thanne thy name

Looke  how thou rydest for the same entente
To wynne good  thou rekkest neuere how
Right so fare I  for ryde I wolde right now
Vnto the worldes ende  for a preye
 A quod this Somonour  benedicite what sey ye

 Nay certeinly quod he  ther haue we noon
But whan vs liketh  we kan take vs oon
Or elles make yow seme  we been shape
Som tyme  lyk a man or lyk an Ape
Or lyk an Angel  kan I ryde or go
It is no wonder thyng thogh it be so
A lowsy Iogelour  kan deceyue thee
And pardee  yet kan I moore craft than he
 Why quod the Somonour  ryde ye thanne or goon
In sondry shape  and nat alwey in oon

As moost able is  oure preyes for to take
  
 What maketh yow  to han al this labour
 fful many a cause  leeue sire Somonour
Seyde this feend  but alle thyng hath tyme
The day is short and it is passed pryme
And yet ne wan I nothyng in this day

And nat entende  hir wittes to declare

To vnderstonde  althogh I tolde hem thee
But for thou axest why labouren we

And meenes  to doon hise comandementz

In diuers art and in diuerse figures
Withouten hym  we haue no myght certayn
If that hym list to stonden ther agayn
And som tyme  at oure prayere  han we leue
Oonly the body  and nat the soule greue
Witnesse on Iob  whom that we diden wo
And som tyme  han we myght of bothe two
This is to seyn  of soule and body eke
And somtyme  be we suffred for to seke
Vpon a man  and doon his soule vnreste
And nat his soule  and al is for the beste
Whan he withstandeth oure temptacioun  
It is  cause  of his sauacioun
Al be it that it was nat oure entente
He sholde be sauf but þat we wolde hym hente
And som tyme  be we seruant vnto man
As to the Bisshope  Seint Dunstan
And to the Apostles  seruant eek was I
 Yet tel me  quod the Somonour feithfully
Make ye yow newe bodies  thus alway
Of Elementz the feend answerde nay 
Som tyme we feyne  and som tyme we aryse
With dede bodyes  in ful sondry wyse
  
And speke as renably  and faire and wel

Come there  thee nedeth nat of me to leere

Til it be so  that thou forsake me
 Nay quod this Somonour  that shal nat bityde

And right at the entryng of the townes ende
To which this Somonour  shoope hym for to wende
They saugh a Cart that charged was with hey
Which þat a Cartere  droof forth in his wey
Deepe was the wey  for which the Carte stood
The Cartere smoot and cryde  as he were wood

Axe hym thy self if thou nat trowest me
Or elles stynt a while  and thou shalt see
 This Cartere  taketh his hors on the croupe
And they bigonne drawen and to stoupe
Heyt now quod he  ther Ihesu crist yow blesse
And al his handwerk bothe moore and lesse
That was wel twight myn owene lyard boy

May I nat axe a libel  sire Somonour
And answere there  by my procutour
To swich thyng as men wole opposen me
 Yis quod this Somonour  pay anon lat se

Yif me xij pens  I may no lenger tarye
 Twelf pens quod she  now lady Seinte Marie
So wisly help me god  out of care and synne
This wyde world  thogh þat I sholde wynne
Ne haue I nat xij pens withInne myn hoold
Ye knowen wel  that I am poure and oold

 Nay thanne quod he  the foule feend me fecche
If I thexcuse  though thou shul be spilt
 Allas quod she  god woot I haue no gilt

Vnto the deuel  blak and rough of hewe

 And whan the deuel  herde hire cursen so
Vpon hir knees  he seyde in this manere
Now Mabely  myn owene moder deere
Is this youre wyl  in ernest þat ye seye

And panne and al  but he wol hym repente
 Nay olde Stot that is nat myn entente
Quod this Somonour  for to repente me

And with that word  this foule feend hym hente
Body and soule  he with the deuel wente
Where as that Somonours  han hir heritage  
And god  þat made  after his ymage
Mankynde  saue and gyde vs alle and some
And leue thise Somonours  goode men bicome
LOrdynges  I koude han toold yow quod this frere
Hadde I had leyser  for this Somnour heere
After the text of Crist Poul  and Iohn
And of oure othere doctours many oon
Swiche peynes  that youre herte myghte agryse
Al be it so  no tonge may it deuyse
Thogh þat I myghte  a thousand wynter telle
The peynes  of thilke cursed hous of helle
  
But for to kepe vs  fro that cursed place
Waketh  and preyeth Ihesu for his grace
So kepe vs  fro the temptour Sathanas
Herketh this word  beth war as in this cas
The leoun sit in his awayt alway
To sle the Innocent if that he may
Disposeth ay  youre hertes to withstonde
The feend  þat yow wolde make  thral and bonde
He may nat tempte yow  ouer youre myght
ffor crist wol be  youre champion and knyght
And prayeth  þat thise Somonours hem repente
Of hir mysdedes  er þat the feend hem hente
THis Somonour  in his Styropes hye stood
Vpon this frere  his herte was so wood
That lyk an Aspen leef  he quook for Ire
 Lordynges quod he  but o thyng I desire
I yow biseke  that of youre curteisye
Syn ye han herd  this false frere lye
As suffereth me  I may my tale telle
This frere bosteth  that he knoweth helle
And god it woot that it is litel wonder
ffreres and feendes  been but lyte asonder
ffor pardee  ye han ofte tyme herd telle
How that a frere  vanysshed was to helle
In spirit ones  by a visioun
And as an Angel  ladde hym vp and doun
To shewen hym  the peynes þat ther were
In al the place  saugh he nat a frere
Of oother folk  he saugh ynowe in wo  
Vnto this Angel  spak the frere tho
 Now sire quod he  han freres swich a grace
That noon of hem  shal come to this place
 Yis quod this Angel  many a Millioun
And vnto Sathanas  he ladde hym doun
And now hath Sathanas  seith he a tayl
Brodder than of a Carryk is the sayl
Hold vp thy tayl  thou Sathanas quod he
Shewe forth thyn ers  and lat the frere se
Where is the nest of freres  in this place
And er þat half a furlong wey of space
  
Right so as bees  out swarmen from an hyue
Out of the deueles ers  ther gonne dryue
Twenty thousand freres  in a route
And thurghout helle  swarmeden aboute
And comen agayn  as faste as they may gon
And in his ers  they crepten euerychon
He clapte his tayl agayn  and lay ful stille
This frere  whan he hadde looke al his fille
Vpon the tormentz  of this sory place
His spirit god restored of his grace
Vnto his body agayn  and he awook
But natheles  for fere yet he quook
So was the deueles ers  ay in his mynde
That is his heritage  of verray kynde
God saue yow alle  saue this cursed frere
My prologe  wol I ende  in this manere

LOrdynges  ther is in yorkshire  as I gesse
A merssh contree  called Holdernesse
In which  ther wente a lymytour aboute
To preche  and eek to begge  it is no doute
And so bifel  that on a day  this frere
Hadde preched at a chirche in his manere
And specially  abouen euery thyng
Excited he the peple  in his prechyng
To trentals  and to yeue for goddes sake
Wherwith  men myghte hooly houses make
Ther as diuine seruyce is honoured
Nat ther as it is wasted and deuoured
Ne ther it nedeth nat for to be yeue
As to possessioners  that mowen lyue
Thanked be god  in wele and habundaunce  
Trentals seyde he  deliueren fro penaunce
Hir freendes soules  as wel olde as yonge
Ye  whan þat they been hastily ysonge
Nat for to holde a preest Ioly and gay
He syngeth nat but o masse in a day
Deliuereth out quod he  anon the soules
fful hard it is  with flesshhook or with oules
To been yclawed  or to brenne or bake
Now spede yow hastily  for cristes sake
And whan this frere  had seyd al his entente
With  qui cum patre  forth his wey he wente
 Whan folk in chirche  had yeue him  what hem lest
He went his wey  no lenger wolde he reste
  
With scrippe and tipped staf ytukked hye
In euery hous  he gan to poure and prye
And beggeth mele  and chese  or elles corn
His felawe hadde a staf  tipped with horn
A peyre of tables  al of yuory
And a poyntel  polysshed fetisly
And wroote the names  alwey as he stood
Of alle folk that yaf hym any good
Asaunces  that he wolde for hem prey
Yif hym a busshel whete  Malt or Reye
A goddes kechyl  or a trype of chese
Or elles what yow lyst we may nat cheese
A goddes halfpeny  or a masse peny
Or yif vs of youre brawn  if ye haue eny
A dagon of youre blanket leeue dame
Oure suster deere  lo heere I write youre name

 A sturdy harlot wente ay hem bihynde
That was hir hostes man  and bar a sak
And what men yaf hem  leyde it on his bak
And whan þat he  was out at dore anon
He planed awey  the names euerichon
That he biforn  had writen in his tables
He serued hem  with nyfles and with fables
 Nay ther thou lixt thou Somonour quod the frere
 Pees quod oure Hoost for cristes mooder deere
Tel forth thy tale  and spare it nat at al
 So thryue I quod this Somonour  so I shal
 So longe he wente hous by hous  til he
Cam til an hous  ther he was wont to be
Refresshed moore  than in an hundred placis
Syk lay the goode man  whos the place is
Bedrede vpon a couche lowe he lay
Deus hic quod he  o Thomas freend good day
Seyde this frere  curteisly and softe

And fro the bench  he droof awey the cat
And leyde adoun  his potente and his hat
And eek his scrippe  and sette hym softe adoun
His felawe  was go walked into toun
fforth with his knaue  into that hostelrye
Where as he shoope hym  thilke nyght to lye
 O deere maister  quod this sike man
How han ye fare  sith þat March bigan

And for oure othere freendes  god hem blesse
I haue to day  been at youre chirche at messe 
And seyd a sermon  after my symple wit
Nat al after the text of hooly writ

And therfore  wol I teche yow al the glose

There haue I taught hem to be charitable
And spende hir good  ther it is resonable
And there I saugh oure dame  a where is she

Seyde this man  and she wol come anon
 Ey maister  wel come be ye  by seint Iohn
Seyde this wyf  how fare ye hertely

And hire embraceth in his Armes narwe
And kiste hire sweete  and chirteth as a sparwe
With his lyppes  dame quod he right weel

Thanked be god  þat yow yaf soule and lyf
Yet saugh I nat this day  so fair a wyf

Graunt mercy dame  this haue I founde alwey
But of youre grete goodnesse  by youre leue

Thise curatz  been ful necligent and slowe
To grope tendrely a conscience
In shrift in prechyng is my diligence
And studie  in Petres wordes  and in Poules

To yelden Ihesu crist  his propre rente
To sprede his word  is set al myn entente
 Now by youre leue  o deere sire quod she
Chideth him weel  for seinte Trinitee
He is as angry  as a pissemyre
Though þat he haue  al that he kan desire
Though I him wrye anyght and make hym warm
And on hym leye my leg outher myn Arm
He groneth lyk oure boor  lith in oure sty
Oother desport ryght noon of hym haue I
I may nat plese hym  in no maner cas
 O Thomas  Ie vous dy  Thomas  Thomas
This maketh the feend  this moste ben amended
Ire is a thyng that hye god defended
And therof wol I speke a word or two
 Now maister quod the wyf er þat I go
What wol ye dyne  I wol go theraboute
 Now dame quod he  Ie vous dy sanz doute
Haue I nat of a capon  but the lyuere
And of youre softe breed  nat but a shyuere
And after that a rosted pigges heed
But that I nolde  no beest for me were deed
Thanne hadde I with yow hoomly suffisaunce
I am a man  of litel sustenaunce
  
My spirit hath his fostryng in the Bible
The body is ay  so redy and penyble
To wake  that my stomak is destroyed
I prey yow dame  ye be nat anoyed
Though I so freendly  yow my conseil shewe
By god  I wolde nat telle it but a fewe
 Now sire quod she  but o word er I go

Soone after  þat ye wente out of this toun
 His deeth  saugh I by reuelacioun
Seith this frere  at hoom in oure dortour

After his deeth  I saugh hym born to blisse
In myn Avision  so god me wisse
So dide our Sexteyn  and oure ffermerer
That han been trewe freres  fifty yeer
They may now  god be thanked of his loone
Maken hir Iubilee  and walke allone
And vp I roos  and al oure Couent eke
With many a teare  triklyng on my cheke
Withouten noyse  or claterynge of belles
Te deum was oure song and no thyng elles
Saue  that to crist I seyde an orison  
Thankynge hym  of his reuelacion
ffor sire and dame  trusteth me right weel
Oure orisons  been wel moore effectueel
And moore we seen  of cristes secree thynges
Than burel folk al though they weren kynges
We lyue in pouerte  and in abstinence
And burell folk  in richesse and despence
Of mete and drynke  and in hir foul delit
We han this worldes lust al in despit
Lazar and diues  lyueden diuersly
And diuerse gerdon  hadden they therby
Who so wol preye  he moot faste and be clene
And fatte his soule  and make his body lene  
We fare as seith thapostle  clooth and foode
Suffisen vs  though they be nat ful goode
The clennesse and the fastynge of vs freres
Maketh  þat crist accepteth oure preyeres
 Lo Moyses  fourty dayes  and fourty nyght
ffasted  er þat the heighe god of myght
Spak with hym  in the mount of Synay
With empty wombe  fastynge many a day
Receyued he the lawe  that was writen
With goddes fynger  and Elye wel ye witen
In mount Oreb  er he hadde any speche
With hye god  that is oure lyues leche
He fasted longe  and was in contemplaunce
 Aaron  that hadde the temple in gouernaunce
And eek that othere preestes euerichon
Into the temple  whan they sholde gon
To preye for the peple  and do seruyse
They nolden drynken  in no maner wyse
No drynke  which þat myghte hem dronke make
But there  in abstinence preye and wake
Lest that they deyden  taak heede what I seye
But they be sobre  that for the peple preye
War that · I seye namoore  for it suffiseth
Oure lord Ihesu  as hooly writ deuyseth
Yaf vs ensample  of fastynge and preyeres
Therfore  we mendynantz  we sely freres
Been wedded  to pouerte and continence
To charite  humblesse  and abstinence
To persecucion  for rightwisnesse
To wepynge  Misericorde and clennesse
And therfore may ye se  þat oure preyeres
I speke of vs  we mendynantz we freres
Been to the hye god  moore acceptable
Than youres  with youre feestes at the table
ffro Paradys first if I shal nat lye  
Was man out chaced  for his glotonye
  
And chaast was man  in Paradys certeyn
 But herkne Thomas  what I shal seyn
I ne haue no text of it as I suppose
But I shal fynde it in a maner glose
That specially  oure sweete lord Ihesus
Spak this by freres  whan he seyde thus
 Blessed be they  that pouere in spirit been
And so forth  al the gospel  may ye seen
Wher it be likker  oure professioun
Or hirs  that swymmen in possessioun
ffy on hire pompe  and hire glotonye
And for hir lewednesse  I hem diffye
 Me thynketh  they been lyk Iovinyan
ffat as a whale  and walkynge as a swan
Al vinolent as Botel in the spence
Hir preyere  is of ful greet reuerence
Whan they for soules  seye the psalm of Dauit
Lo  but they seye  cor meum eructauit
Who folweth  cristes gospel  and his foore
But we þat humble been  and chaast and poore
Werkeris of goddes word  not Auditours
Therfore  right as an hauk vp at a sours
Vp springeth into their  right so prayeres
Of charitable  and chaste bisy freres
Maken hir sours  to goddes eres two
Thomas Thomas  so moote I ryde or go
And by that lord  þat clepid is seint Yue
Nere thou oure brother  sholdestou nat thryue
In our Chapitre  praye we day and nyght
To crist þat he thee sende  heele and myght
Thy body  for to weelden hastily
 God woot quod he  no thyng therof feele I
As help me crist as in a fewe yeres
I han spent  vpon diuerse manere freres
fful many a pound  yet fare I neuer the bet
Certeyn my good  I haue almoost biset
  
ffarwel my gold  for it is al ago
 The frere answerde  o Thomas dostow so
What nedeth yow  diuerse freres seche
What nedeth hym  þat hath a parfit leche
To sechen  othere leches in the toun
Youre inconstance  is youre confusioun
Holde ye thanne me  or elles oure Couent
To praye for yow  been insufficient
Thomas that Iape  nys nat worth a myte
Youre maladye  is for we han to lyte
A yif that Couent half a quarter otes  
A yif that Couent xxiiij grotes
A yif that frere a peny  and lat hym go
Nay nay Thomas  it may no thyng be so
What is a ferthyng worth  parted in twelue
Lo ech thyng that is oned  in it selue
Is moore strong than whan it is toscatered
Thomas  of me  thou shalt nat been yflatered
Thou woldest han oure labour al for noght
The hye god  that al this world hath wroght
Seith that the werkman  worthy is his hyre
Thomas  noght of youre tresor I desire
As for my self but that al oure Couent
To preye for yow  is ay so diligent
And for to buylden  cristes owene chirche
Thomas  if ye wol lernen for to wirche
Of buyldynge vp of chirches  may ye fynde
If it be good  in Thomas lyf of Inde
Ye lye heere  ful of Anger of Ire
With which  the deuel set youre herte afyre
And chiden heere  the sely Innocent
Youre wyf that is so meke and pacient
And therfore Thomas  trowe me if thee leste
Ne stryue nat with thy wyf as for thy beste
And ber this word awey  now by thy feith
Touchynge this thyng lo what the wise seith
  
 WithInne thyn hous ne be thou no leoun
To thy subgitz  do noon oppressioun
Ne make thyne aqueyntances  nat for to flee
And Thomas  yet eftsoones I charge thee
Be war from hire  þat in thy bosom slepeth
Be war fro the serpent that so slily crepeth
Vnder the gras  and styngeth subtilly
Be war my sone  and herkne paciently
That twenty thousand men  han lost hir lyues
ffor stryuyng with hir lemmans and hir wyues
Now sith ye han  so hooly meke a wyf
What nedeth yow Thomas  to maken stryf
Ther nys ywys  no serpent so cruel
What man tret on his tayl  ne half so fel
As womman is  whan she hath caught an Ire
Vengeance is thanne  al that they desire
Ire is a synne  oon of the grete of seuene
Abhomynable  vnto the god of heuene
And to hym self it is destruccion
This euery lewed viker or person
Kan seye  how Ire engendreth homycide
Ire is in sooth  executour of pryde
I koude of Ire seye  so muche sorwe  
My tale  sholde laste  til tomorwe
And therfore  preye I god  bothe day and nyght
An Irous man  god sende hym litel myght
It is greet harm  and eek greet pitee
To sette an Irous man  in heigh degree
WHilom  ther was an Irous potestat
As seith Senek that durynge his estaat
Vpon a day  out ryden knyghtes two
And as ffortune  wolde that it were so
That oon of hem cam hoom that oother noght
Anon the knyght bifore the Iuge is broght
That seyde thus  thou hast thy felawe slayn
ffor which  I deme thee to the deeth certayn
  
And to another knyght comanded he
Go lede hym to the deeth  I charge thee
And happed  as they wente by the weye
Toward the place  ther he sholde deye
The knyght cam  which men wenden had be deed
Thanne thoughte they  it was the beste reed
To lede hem bothe  to the Iuge agayn
They seiden lord  the knyght ne hath nat slayn
His felawe  heere he standeth hool alyue
Ye shul be deed quod he  so moot I thryue
That is to seyn  bothe oon  and two  and thre
And to the firste knyght right thus spak he
I dampned thee  thou most algate be deed
And thou also  most nedes lese thyn heed
ffor thou art cause  why thy felawe deyth
And to the thridde knyght right thus he seith
Thou hast nat doon  that I comanded thee
And thus  he dide doon sleen hem alle thre
Irous Cambises  was eek dronkelewe
And ay delited hym  to been a shrewe
And so bifel  a lord of his meynee
That loued vertuous moralitee
Seyde on a day  bitwene hem two right thus
 A lord is lost if he be vicius
And dronkenesse  is eek a foul record
Of any man  and namely in a lord
Ther is ful many an eye and many an ere
Awaityng on a lord  and he noot where
ffor goddes loue  drynk moore attemprely
Wyn maketh man  to lesen wrecchedly
His mynde  and hise lymes euerichon
 The reuers shaltou se  quod he anon
And preeue it by thyn owene experience
That wyn  ne dooth to folk no swich offence
Ther is no wyn  bireueth me my myght  
Of hand ne foot ne of myne eyen sight
  
And for despit he drank ful muchel moore
And hondred part than he hadde bifoore
And right anon  this Irous cursed wrecche
Leet this knyghtes sone  bifore hym fecche
Comandynge hym  he sholde bifore hym stonde
And sodeynly  he took his bowe in honde
And vp the streng he pulled to his ere
And with an arwe  he slow the child right there
Now  wheither haue I  a siker hand or noon
Quod he  is al my myght and mynde agon
Hath wyn bireft me myne eyen sight
 What sholde I telle  thanswere of the knyght
His sone was slayn  ther is namoore to seye
Beth war therfore  with lordes how ye pleye
Syngeth Placebo  and I shal if I kan
But if it be  vnto a poure man
To a poure man  men sholde hise vices telle
But nat to a lord  thogh he sholde go to helle
LO Irous Cirus  thilke Percien
How he destroyed  the ryuer of Gysen
ffor that an hors of his was dreynt therInne
Whan þat he wente  Babiloigne to wynne
He made  that the Ryuer  was so smal
That wommen  myghte wade it ouer al
Lo what seyde he  that so wel teche kan
Ne be no felawe to an Irous man
Ne with no wood man  walke by the weye
Lest thee repente  ther is namoore to seye
NOw Thomas leeue brother  lef thyn Ire
Thou shalt me fynde  as Iust as is a squyre
Hoold nat the deueles knyf ay at thyn herte
Thyn angre dooth thee  al to soore smerte
But shewe to me  al thy confession
 Nay quod the sike man  by Seint Symon

I haue hym toold hoolly al myn estat
  
Nedeth namoore  to speken of it seith he
But if me list of myn humylitee
 Yif me thanne of thy gold  to make oure cloystre
Quod he  for many a Muscle  and many an oystre
Whan othere men  han ben ful wel at eyse
Hath been oure foode  our cloystre for to reyse
And yet god woot vnnethe the fundement
Parfourned is  ne of our pauement
Nys nat a tyl yet withInne oure wones
By god  we owen fourty pound for stones
 Now help Thomas  for hym that harwed helle  
ffor elles  moste we oure bookes selle
And if ye lakke  oure predicacion
Thanne goth the world  al to destruccion
ffor who so wolde  vs fro this world bireue
So god me saue  Thomas by youre leue
He wolde bireue  out of this world the sonne
ffor who kan teche  and werchen as we konne
And that is nat of litel tyme quod he
But syn Ennok was  or Elise
Han freres been  that fynde I of record
In charitee  ythanked be oure lord
Now Thomas  helpe for seinte charitee
And doun anon  he sette hym on his knee
THis sike man  wax wel ny wood for Ire
He wolde  þat the frere  had been on fire
With his false dissymulacion
Swich thyng as is in my possession
Quod he  that may I yeuen  and noon oother
Ye sey me thus  that I am youre brother
 Ye certes quod the frere  trusteth weel
I took oure dame  oure lettre and oure seel
 Now wel quod he  and som what shal I yeue
Vnto youre hooly Couent whil I lyue
And in thyn hand  thou shalt it haue anon
On this condicion  and oother noon
  
That thou departe it so  my leeue brother
That euery frere  haue also muche as oother
This shaltou swere  on thy profession
Withouten fraude  or cauillacion

Lo heer my feith  in me shal be no lak

Seyde this man  and grope wel bihynde
Bynethe my buttok ther shaltow fynde
A thyng that I haue hyd in pryuetee
 A thoghte this frere  this shal go with me
And doun his hand  he launcheth to the clifte
In hope  for to fynde there a yifte
And whan this sike man  felte this frere
Aboute his tuwel  grope there and heere
Amydde his hand  he leet the frere a fart
Ther nys no capul  drawynge in a Cart
That myghte haue lete a fart of swich a soun
 The frere vp stirte  as dooth a wood leoun
A fals cherl quod he  for goddes bones
This hastow for despit doon for the nones
Thou shalt abye this fart if that I may  
 His meynee  whiche that herden this affray
Cam lepynge In  and chaced out the frere
And forth he gooth  with a ful Angry cheere
And fette his felawe  ther as lay his stoor
He looked  as it were a wilde boor
He grynte with his teeth  so was he wrooth
A sturdy paas  doun to the lordes court he gooth
Wher as woned a man  of greet honour
To whom  that he was alwey confessour
This worthy man  was lord of that village
This frere cam  as he were in a rage
Where as this lord  sat etyng at his bord
Vnnethes  myghte the frere  speke a word
  
Til atte laste  he seyde  god yow see

What frere Iohn  what maner world is this

Sit doun anon  and tel me what youre grief is
And it shal been amended  if that I may

That in this world  is noon so poure a page
That he nolde haue abhomynacioun
Of that I haue receyued in youre toun
And yet greueth me  no thyng so soore
As that this olde cherl  with lokkes hoore
Blasphemed hath  oure hooly Couent eke
 Now maister quod this lord  I yow biseke
 No maister quod he  but seruitour
Thogh I haue had in scole swich honour
God liketh nat that Raby men vs calle
Neither in Market ne in youre large halle
 No fors quod he  but tel me al youre grief
 Sire quod he  an odious meschief
This day bityd is  to myn ordre and me
And so per consequens  in ech degree
Of hooly chirche  god amende it soone
 Sire quod the lord  ye woot what is to doone
Distempre yow noght  ye be my Confessour
Ye been the salt of the erthe  and the savour
ffor goddes loue  youre pacience ye holde
Tel me youre grief and he anon hym tolde
As ye han herd biforn  ye woot wel what
 The lady of the hous  al stille sat
Til she had herd  what the frere sayde
Ey goddes mooder quod she  blisful mayde
Is ther oght elles  telle me feithfully  
 Madame quod he  how thynke ye herby
  
 How that me thynketh quod she so god me speede
I seye  a cherle hath doon  a cherles dede
What shold I seye  god lat hym neuere thee
His sike heed  is ful of vanytee
I holde hym  in a manere frenesye
 Madame quod he  by god I shal nat lye
But I on hym  oother weyes be wreke
I shal disclaundre hym  ouer al ther I speke
This false blasphemour  that charged me
To parte  that wol nat departed be
To euery man yliche  with meschaunce
 The lord sat stille  as he were in a traunce
And in his herte  he rolled vp and doun
How hadde the cherl  this ymaginacioun
To shewe swich a probleme  to the frere
Neuere erst er now  herd I of swich mateere
I trowe  the deuel  putte it in his mynde
In Ars Metrik shal ther no man fynde
Biforn this day  of swich a question
Certes  it was a shrewed conclusion
That euery man  sholde haue yliche his part
As of the soun  or savour of a fart
O vile proude cherl  I shrewe his face
Lo sires quod the lord  with harde grace
Who herd euere of swich a thyng er now
To euery man ylike  tel me how
It is an inpossible  it may nat be
Ey nyce cherl  god lete thee neuere thee
The rumblynge of a fart and euery soun
Nis but of Eir reuerberacioun
And euere it wasteth  litel and litel awey
Ther is no man  kan demen by my fey
If that it were departed equally
What lo my cherl  lo yet how shrewedly
Vnto my confessour  to day he spak
I holde hym certeyn  a demonyak
  
Now ete youre mete  and lat the cherl go pleye
Lat hym go honge hymself a deuel weye
NOW stood the lordes Squier at the bord
That karf his mete  and herde word by word
Of alle thynges  whiche that I haue sayd
My lord quod he  beth nat yuele apayd
 I koude telle for a gowne clooth  
To yow sire frere  so ye be nat wrooth
How that this fart euene delt shal be
Among youre Couent if it lyked me
 Tel quod the lord  and thou shalt haue anon
A gowne clooth  by god  and by Seint Iohn
 My lord quod he  whan þat the weder is fair
Withouten wynd  or perturbynge of Air
Lat brynge a Cartwheel into this halle
But looke  that it haue his spokes alle
Twelue spokes  hath a Cartwheel comunly
And bryng me thanne xij freres woot ye why
For twelue is a Couent as I gesse
The Confessour heere  for his worthynesse
Shal parfourne vp  the nombre of his Couent
Thanne shal they knele doun  by oon assent
And to euery spokes ende  in this manere
fful sadly  leye his nose shal a frere
Youre noble Confessour  there god hym saue
Shal holde his nose  vpright  vnder the Naue
Thanne shal this cherl  with bely stif and toght
As any Tabour  been hyder ybroght
And sette hym on the wheel  right of this Cart
Vpon the Naue  and make hym lete a fart
And ye shul seen  vp peril of my lyf
By preeue  which that is demonstratif
  
That equally  the soun of it wol wende
And eke the stynk vnto the spokes ende
Saue þat this worthy man youre Confessour
By cause  he is a man of greet honour
Shal haue the firste fruyt  as reson is
As yet the noble vsage  of freres is
The worthy men of hem  shul first be serued
And certeinly  he hath it weel disserued
He hath to day taught vs so muche good
With prechyng in the pulpit ther he stood
That I may vouche sauf  I sey for me
He hadde the firste smel  of fartes three
And so wolde  al the Couent hardily
He bereth hym  so faire and hoolily
 The lord  the lady  and alle men saue the frere
Seyde  þat Iankyn spak in this matere
As wel as Euclude  or Protholomee
Touchynge this cherl  they seyde subtiltee
And heigh wit made hym speke  as he spak
He nys no fool  ne no demonyak
And Iankyn  hath ywonne a newe gowne
My tale is doon  we been almoost at towne
Sire clerk  of Oxenford  oure Hoost sayde
ye ryde as coy  and stille  as dooth a mayde
were newe spoused  sittynge at the bord
This day  ne herde I  of youre tonge a word
I trowe ye studie  aboute som Sophyme
But Salomon seith  euery thyng hath tyme
 ffor goddes sake  as beth of bettre cheere
It is no tyme  for to studien heere
Telle vs som myrie tale  by youre fey
ffor what man  that is entred in a pley
He nedes moot vnto the pley assente
But precheth nat as freres doon in lente
To make vs  for oure olde synnes wepe
Ne that thy tale  make vs nat to slepe
 Telle vs  som murie thyng of auentures
Youre termes  youre colours  and youre figures
Keepe hem in stoor  til so be that ye endite
Heigh style  as whan þat men to kynges write
Speketh so pleyn  at this tyme we yow preye
That we may vnderstonde what ye seye
 This worthy clerk benignely answerde
Hoost quod he  I am vnder youre yerde
Ye han of vs  as now the gouernance
And therfore  wol I do yow obeisance
  
As fer as reson axeth hardily
I wol yow telle a tale  which that I
Lerned at Padwe  of a worthy clerk
As preued  by his wordes and his werk
He is now deed  and nayled in his cheste
I prey to god  so yeue his soule reste
 ffraunceys Perak the lauriat poete
Highte this clerk whos Rethorik sweete
Enlumyned al Ytaille of poetrie
As Lynyan dide  of Philosophie
Or lawe  or oother Art particuler
But deeth  þat wol nat dwellen heer
But as it were  a twynklyng of an eye
Hem bothe hath slayn  and alle shul we dye
 But forth to tellen  of this worthy man  
That taughte me this tale  as I bigan
I seye  that first with heigh stile he enditeth
Er he  the body of his tale writeth
A prohemye  in the which discryueth he
Pemond  and of Saluces the contree
And speketh of Apennyn  the hilles hye
That been the boundes  of westlumbardye
 And of Mount Vesulus  in special
Where as the poo  out of a welle smal
Taketh his firste spryngyng and his sours
That Estward  ay encresseth in his cours
To Emeleward  to fferrare and Venyse
The which a long thyng were to deuyse
And trewely  as to my Iuggement
Me thynketh it a thyng impertinent
Saue that he wole  conuoyen his mateere
But this his tale  which that ye may heere
THer is  at the West syde of Ytaille
Doun at the roote  of Vesulus the colde
A lusty playne  habundant of vitaille
Where many a tour and toun  thou mayst biholde
That founded were  in tyme  of fadres olde
And many another  delitable sighte
And Saluces this noble contree highte
A Markys  whilom lord was of that lond
As were  hise worthy eldres hym bifore
And obeisant and redy to his hond
Were alle hise liges  bothe lasse and moore
Thus in delit he lyueth  and hath doon yoore
Biloued and drad  thurgh favour of ffortune
Bothe of hise lordes  and of his commune
Therwith he was  to speke as of lynage
The gentilleste yborn of lumbardye
A fair persone and strong and yong of age
And ful  honour and of curteisye
Discreet ynogh  his contree for to gye
Saue that in somme thynges  þat he was to blame
And Walter was this yonge lordes name
I blame hym thus  that he considereth noght  
In tyme comynge  what hym myghte bityde
But in his lust present was al his thoght
As for to hauke and hunte  on euery syde
Wel ny  alle othere cures  leet he slyde
And eek he nolde  and that was worst of alle
Wedde no wyf  for noght þat may bifalle
  
Oonly that point his peple bar so soore
That flokmeele on a day  they to hym wente
And oon of hem  that wisest was of loore
Or elles  that the lord  best wolde assente
That he sholde telle hym  what his peple mente
Or elles  koude he shewe wel swich mateere
He to the Markys  seyde as ye shul heere
 O noble Markys  youre humanitee
Asseureth vs  to yeue vs hardinesse
As ofte  as tyme is of necessitee
That we to yow  mowe telle oure heuynesse
Accepteth lord  now for youre gentillesse
That we with pitous herte  vnto yow pleyne
And lat youre eres  nat my voys desdeyne
Al haue I noght to doone  in this mateere
Moore than another man  hath in this place
Yet for as muche  as ye my lord so deere
Han alwey  shewed me  fauour and grace
I dar the bettre  aske of yow a space
Of Audience  to shewen oure requeste
And ye my lord  to doon right as yow leste
ffor certes lord  so wel vs liketh yow
And al youre werk and euere han doon  þat we
Ne koude nat vs self deuysen how
We myghte lyuen  in moore felicitee
Saue o thyng lord  if youre wille be
That for to been a wedded man yow leste
Thanne were youre peple  in souereyn hertes reste
Boweth youre nekke  vnder that blisful yok 
Of soueraynetee  noght of seruyse
Which þat men clepeth  spousaille or wedlok
And thenketh lord  among youre thoghtes wyse
  
How þat oure dayes passe  in sondry wyse
ffor thogh we slepe  or wake  or rome  or ryde
Ay fleeth the tyme  it nyl no man abyde
And thogh youre grene youthe  floure as yit  
In crepeth age alwey  as stille as stoon
And deeth manaceth  euery age and smyt
In ech estaat for ther escapeth noon
And al so certein  as we knowe echoon
That we shul deye  as vncerteyn  we alle
Been of that day  whan deeth shal on vs falle
Accepteth thanne of vs  the trewe entente
That neuere yet refuseden thyn heeste
And we wol lord  if that ye wole assente
Chese yow a wyf in short tyme atte leeste
Born of the gentilleste  and of the meeste
Of al this land  so that it oghte seme
Honour to god and yow  as we kan deeme
Deliuere vs  out of al this bisy drede
And taak a wyf for hye goddes sake
ffor if it so bifelle  as god forbede
That thurgh youre deeth  youre lyne sholde slake
And that a straunge Successour sholde take
Youre heritage  o wo were vs alyue
Wherfore  we pray you hastily to wyue
 Hir meeke preyere  and hir pitous cheere
Made the Markys herte  han pitee
Ye wol quod he  myn owene peple deere
To that I neuere erst thoughte  streyne me

That seelde tyme  is founde in mariage
Ther I was free  I moot been in seruage
  
But nathelees  I se youre trewe entente
And truste vpon youre wit  and haue doon ay
Wherfore  of my free wyl  I wole assente
To wedde me  as soone as euere I may
But ther as ye  han profred me this day
To chese me a wyf  I yow relesse

ffor god it woot that children ofte been
Vnlyk hir worthy eldres hem bifore
Bountee comth al of god  nat of the streen
Of which  they been engendred and ybore

Lat me allone  in chesynge of my wyf  
That charge  vp on my bak I wole endure
But I yow preye  and charge vp on youre lyf
What wyf that I take  ye me assure
To worshipe hire  whil that hir lyf may dure
In word and werk bothe heere and euerywheere
As she  an Emperoures doghter weere
And forthermoore  this shal ye swere  that ye
Agayn my choys  shul neither grucche ne stryue
ffor sith  I shal  forgoon my libertee
At youre requeste  as euere moot I thryue
Ther as myn herte is set ther wol I wyue
And but ye wole assente in this manere
I prey yow  speketh namoore of this matere
 With hertely wyl  they sworen and assenten
To al this thyng ther seyde no wight nay
Bisekynge hym of grace  er that they wenten
That he  wolde graunten hem a certein day
  
Of his spousaille  as soone  as euere he may
ffor yet alwey  the peple som what dredde
Lest þat this Markys  no wyf wolde wedde
 He graunted hem a day  swich as hym leste
On which  he wolde be wedded sikerly
And seyde  he dide al this at hir requeste
And they  with humble entente  buxomly
Knelynge vp on hir knees ful reuerently
Hym thonken alle  and thus they han an ende
Of hire entente  and hoom agayn they wende
 And heer vp on  he to hise officeres
Comaundeth  for the feste to purveye
And to hise priuee knyghtes and squieres
Swich charge yaf  as hym liste on hem leye
And they  to his comandement obeye
And ech of hem  dooth al his diligence
To doon  vnto the feeste reuerence
NOght fer  fro thilke paleys honurable
Ther as this Markys  shoope his mariage
There stood a throope  of site delitable
In which  that poure folk of that village
Hadden hir beestes  and hir herbergage
And of hire labour  tooke hir sustenance
After that the erthe  yaf hem habundance
Amonges thise poure folk ther dwelte a man
Which þat was holden  pourest of hem alle
But hye god  som tyme senden kan
His grace  in to a litel oxes stalle
Ianicula  men of that throope hym calle
A doghter hadde he  fair ynogh to sighte
And Grisildis  this yonge mayden highte
  
But for to speke  of vertuous bountee
Thanne was she  oon the faireste vnder sonne
ffor poureliche  yfostred vp was she
No likerous lust was thurgh hire herte yronne
Wel ofter  of the welle  than of the tonne
She drank and for she wolde vertu plese
She knew wel labour but noon ydel ese
But thogh this mayde  tendre were of age
Yet in the brest of hire virginitee
Ther was enclosed  rype and sad corage
And in greet reuerence  and charitee
Hir olde poure fader fostred shee
A fewe sheepe  spynnynge on feeld she kepte
She wolde noght been ydel til she slepte
And whan she homward cam  she wolde brynge
Wortes  or othere herbes  tymes ofte
The whiche she shredde  and seeth for hir lyuynge
And made hir bed  ful harde and no thyng softe
And ay she kepte  hir fadres lyf on lofte
With euerich obeisaunce and diligence
That child may doon  to fadres reuerence
 Vp on Grisilde  this poure creature
fful ofte sithe  this Markys caste his eye
As he  on huntyng rood parauenture
And whan þat it fil  þat he myghte hire espye
He noght with wantowne lookyng of folye
Hise eyen caste on hire  but in sad wyse
Vp on hir chiere  he gan hym ofte auyse
Commendynge in his herte  hir wommanhede  
And eek hir vertu  passynge any wight
Of so yong age  as wel in chiere as dede
ffor thogh the peple  hadde no greet insight
  
In vertu  he considered ful right
Hir bountee  and disposed that he wolde
Wedde hire oonly  if euere he wedde sholde
 The day of weddyng cam  but no wight kan
Telle  what womman  that it sholde be
ffor which merueille  wondred many a man
And seyden  whan that they were in priuetee
Wol nat oure lord  yet leue his vanytee
Wol he nat wedde  allas allas the while
Why wole he thus  hym self and vs bigile
 But nathelees  this Markys hath doon make
Of gemmes  set in gold and in Asure
Brooches and rynges  for Grisildis sake
And of hir clothyng took he the mesure
By a mayde  lyk to hire stature
And eek of othere aornementes alle
That vnto swich a weddyng sholde falle
The time of vndren  of the same day
Approcheth  that this weddyng sholde be
And al the paleys  put was in array
Bothe halle and chambres  ech in his degree
Houses of office  stuffed with plentee
Ther maystow seen  of deynteuous vitaille
That may be founde  as fer as last ytaille
This roial Markys  richely arrayed
Lordes and ladyes  in his compaignye
The whiche  that to the feeste weren yprayed
And of his retenue  the bachelrye
With many a soun  of sondry melodye
Vnto the village  of the which I tolde
In this array  the righte wey han holde
  
 Grisilde of this  god woot ful Innocent
That for hire  shapen was al this array
To fecchen water at a welle is went
And comth hoom  as soone as euer she may
ffor wel she hadde herd seyd  that thilke day
The Markys sholde wedde  and if she myghte
She wolde fayn  han seyn  som of that sighte
She thoghte  I wole  with othere maydens stonde  
That been my felawes  in oure dore and se
The Markysesse  and therfore wol I fonde
To doon at hoom  as soone as it may be
The labour  which that longeth vnto me
And thanne I may  at leyser hire biholde
If she this wey  vnto the Castel holde
And as she wolde  ouer hir thresshfold gon
The Markys cam  and gan hire for to calle
And she set doun  hir water pot anon
Biside the thresshfold in an Oxes stalle
And doun vpon hir knes she gan to falle
And with sad contenance  kneleth stille
Til she had herd  what was the lordes will
 This thoghtful Markys  spak vnto this mayde
fful sobrely  and seyde in this manere
Where is youre fader  o Grisildis he sayde
And she with reuerence  in humble cheere
Answerde  lord  he is al redy heere
And In she gooth  with outen lenger lette
And to the Markys  she hir fader fette
He by the hand  thanne took this olde man
And seyde thus  whan he hym hadde asyde
Ianicula  I neither may ne kan
Lenger  the plesance of myn herte hyde
  
If that thou vouche sauf what so bityde
Thy doghter wol I take  er þat I wende
As for my wyf vnto hir lyues ende
Thou louest me  I woot it wel certeyn
And art my feithful  lige man ybore
And all that liketh me  I dar wel seyn
It liketh thee  and specially therfore
Tel me that poynt  that I haue seyd bifore
If that thou wolt vnto that purpos drawe
To take me  as for thy sone in lawe
 This sodeyn cas  this man astonyed so
That reed he wax abayst and al quakyng
He stood  vnnethes seyde he wordes mo
But oonly thus  lord quod he  my willynge
Is as ye wole  ne ayeyns  youre likynge
I wol no thyng ye be my lord so deere
Right as yow lust gouerneth this mateere
 Yet wol I  quod this Markys softely  
That in thy chambre  I and thou  and she
Haue a collacion  and wostow why
ffor I wol axe  if it hire wille be
To be my wyf  and reule hire after me
And al this shal be doon  in thy presence
I wol noght speke  out of thyn Audience
 And in the chambre  whil they were aboute
Hir tretys  which as ye shal after heere
The peple cam  vnto the hous with oute
And wondred hem  in how honeste manere
And tentifly  she kepte hir fader deere
But outrely  Grisildis wondre myghte
ffor neuere erst ne saugh she swich a sighte
  
No wonder is  thogh she were astoned
To seen so greet a gest come in that place
She neuere was  to swiche gestes woned
ffor which  she looked  with ful pale face
But shortly  forth this tale for to chace
Thise arn the wordes  þat the Markys sayde
To this benigne  verray feithful mayde
 Grisilde he seyde  ye shal wel vnderstonde
It liketh to youre fader and to me
That I yow  wedde  and eek it may so stonde
As I suppose  ye wol that it so be
But thise demandes  axe I first quod he
That sith it shal be doon  in hastif wyse
Wol ye assente  or elles yow auyse
I seye this  be ye redy with good herte
To al my lust and that I frely may
As me best thynketh  do yow laughe or smerte
And neuere ye to grucche it nyght ne day
And eek whan I sey ye  ne sey nat nay
Neither by word  ne frownyng contenance
Swere this  and heere I swere yow alliance
 Wondrynge vp on this word  quakynge for drede
She seyde lord  vndigne and vnworthy
Am I  to thilke honour þat ye me beede
But as ye wole youre self right so wol I
And heere I swere  that neuere willyngly
In werk ne thoght I nyl yow disobeye
ffor to be deed  though me were looth to deye
 This is ynogh  Grisilde myn quod he  
And forth he gooth  with a ful sobre cheere
Out at the dore  and after that cam she
And to the peple  he seyde in this manere
  
This is my wyf quod he  þat standeth heere
Honoureth hire  and loueth hire I preye
Who so me loueth  ther is namoore to seye
And for that no thyng of hir olde geere
She sholde brynge in to his hous  he bad
That wommen  sholde dispoillen hire right theere
Of which thise ladyes  were nat right glad
To handle hir clothes  wher Inne she was clad
But nathelees  this mayde bright of hewe
ffro foot to heed  they clothed han al newe
Hir heris han they kembd  that lay vntressed
fful rudely  and with hir fyngres smale
A corone on hire heed  they han ydressed
And sette hire  ful of Nowches grete and smale
Of hire array  what sholde I make a tale
Vnnethe the peple hire knew  for hire fairnesse
Whan she translated was in swich richesse
 This Markys  hath hire spoused with a ryng
Broght for the same cause  and thanne hire sette
Vp on an hors snow whit and wel amblyng
And to his paleys  er he lenger lette
With ioyful peple þat hire ladde and mette
Conuoyed hire  and thus the day they spende
In reuel  til the sonne gan descende
And shortly  forth this tale for to chace
I seye  that to this newe Markysesse
God hath swich fauour  sent hire of his grace
That it ne semed nat by liklynesse
That she was  born and fed in rudenesse
As in a cote  or in an Oxe Stalle
But norissed  in an Emperoures halle
  
 To euery wight she woxen is so deere
And worshipful  þat folk ther she was bore
And from hire birthe  knewe hire yeer by yeere
Vnnethe trowed they  but dorste han swore
That she to Ianicle  of which I spak bifore
She doghter were  for as by coniecture
Hem thoughte  she was another creature
ffor though that euere vertuous was she  
She was encressed  in swich excellence
Of thewes goode  yset in heigh bountee
And so discreet and fair of eloquence
So benigne  and so digne of reuerence
And koude so  the peples herte embrace
That ech hire louede  that looked on hir face
 Noght oonly of Saluces in the toun
Publiced was  the beautee of hir name
But eek biside  in many a regioun
If oon seide wel  another seyde the same
So spradde  of hire heighe bountee the name
That men and wommen  as wel yonge as olde
Goon to Saluce  vpon hire to bihold
Thus Walter lowely nay  but roially
Wedded  with fortunat honestetee
In goddes pees  lyueth ful esily
At hoom  and outward  grace ynogh had he
And for he saugh  that vnder heigh degree
Was vertu hid  the peple hym heelde
A prudent man  and that is seyn ful seelde
 Nat oonly this Grisildis  thurgh hir wit
Koude al the feet of wyfly humblenesse
But eek whan that the cas required it
The commune profit koude she redresse
  
Ther nas discord  rancour  ne heuynesse
In al that land  that she ne koude apese
And wisely  brynge hem alle in reste and ese
Though that hire housbonde absent were anon
If gentil men  or othere of hire contree
Were wrothe  she wolde bryngen hem aton
So wise  and rype wordes hadde she
And Iuggementz of so greet equitee
That she from heuene  sent was as men wende
Peple to saue  and euery wrong tamende
 Nat longe tyme  after that this Grisild
Was wedded  she a doghter hath ybore
Al had hire leuere  haue born a man child
Glad was this Markys  and the folk therfore
ffor though a mayde child  coome al bifore
She may  vnto a man child atteyne
By liklihede  syn she nys nat bareyne
THer fil  as it bifalleth tymes mo
Whan þat this child  had souked but a throwe
This Markys  in his herte longeth so
To tempte his wyf hir sadnesse for to knowe
That he ne myghte  out of his herte throwe
This merueillous desir his wyf tassaye
Nedelees god woot he thoghte  hire for taffraye
He hadde assayed hire  ynogh bifore
And foond hire euere good  what neded it
Hire for to tempte  and alwey  moore and moore
Though som men preise it for a subtil wit
But as for me  I seye that yuele it sit
To assaye a wyf whan þat it is no nede
And putten hire  in angwyssh and in drede
  
ffor which  this Markys  wroghte in this manere
He cam allone  a nyght  ther as she lay
With stierne face  and with ful trouble cheere
And seyde thus  Grisilde quod he that day
That I yow took out of youre pouere array
And putte yow  in estaat of heigh noblesse
Ye haue  nat that forgeten as I gesse
I seye Grisilde  this present dignitee
In which that I haue put yow  as I trowe
Maketh yow nat foryetful for to be
That I yow took in poure estaat ful lowe
ffor any wele  ye moot youre seluen knowe
Taak heede  of euery word  that y yow seye
Ther is no wight that hereth it but we tweye
Ye woot youre self wel  how þat ye cam heere
In to this hous  it is nat longe ago
And though to me  þat ye be lief and deere
Vnto my gentils  ye be no thyng so
They seyn  to hem  it is greet shame and wo
ffor to be subgetz  and to been in seruage
To thee  that born art of a smal village
And namely  sith thy doghter was ybore
Thise wordes  han they spoken doutelees
But I desire  as I haue doon bifore
To lyue my lyf with hem  in reste and pees
I may nat in this caas  be recchelees
I moot doon with thy doghter for the beste
Nat as I wolde  but as my peple leste
And yet god woot this is ful looth to me  
But nathelees  with oute youre wityng
I wol nat doon  but this wol I quod he
That ye to me assente  as in this thyng
  
Shewe now youre pacience  in youre werkyng
That ye me highte  and swore in youre village
That day  that maked was oure mariage
 Whan she had herd al this  she noght ameued
Neither in word  or chiere or countenance
ffor as it semed  she was nat agreued
She seyde lord  al lyth in youre plesance
My child and I  with hertely obeisance
Been youres al  and ye mowe saue and spille
Youre owene thyng werketh after youre wille
Ther may no thyng  god so my soule saue
Liken to yow  that may displese me
Ne I ne desire  no thyng for to haue
Ne drede for to leese  saue oonly thee  vel yee
This wyl is in myn herte  and ay shal be
No lengthe of tyme  or deeth may this deface
Ne chaunge my corage  to another place
 Glad was this Markys  of hire answeryng
But yet he feyned  as he were nat so
Al drery was his cheere  and his lookyng
Whan þat he sholde  out of the chambre go
Soone after this  a furlong wey or two
He priuely  hath toold al his entente
Vnto a man  and to his wyf hym sente
A maner sergeant was this priuee man
The which þat feithful ofte  he founden hadde
In thynges grete  and eek swich folk wel kan
Doon execucion on thynges badde
The lord knew wel  that he hym loued and dradde
And whan this sergeant wiste the lordes wille
In to the chambre  he stalked hym ful stille
  
 Madame he seyde  ye moote foryeue it me
Though I do thyng to which I am constreyned
Ye been so wys  that ful wel knowe ye
That lordes heestes  mowe nat been yfeyned
They mowe wel been  biwailled and compleyned
But men moote nede  vnto hire lust obeye
And so wol I  ther is namoore to seye
This child  I am comanded for to take  
And spak namoore  but out the child he hente
Despitously  and gan a cheere make
As though he wolde  han slayn it er he wente
Grisildis  moot al suffren and consente
And as a lamb  she sitteth meke and stille
And leet this crueel sergeant doon his wille
 Suspecious  was the diffame of this man
Suspect his face  suspect his word also
Suspect the tyme  in which he this bigan
Allas hir doghter that she loued so
She wende  he wolde han slawen it right tho
But nathelees  she neither weepe ne syked
Consentynge hire  to that the Markys lyked
But atte laste  to speken she bigan
And mekely  she to the sergeant preyde
So as he was  a worthy gentil man
That she moste kisse hire child  er þat it deyde
And in hir barm  this litel child she leyde
With ful sad face  and gan the child to kisse
And lulled it and after gan it blisse
And thus she seyde  in hire benigne voys
ffare weel my child  I shal thee neuere see
But sith  I thee  haue marked with the croys
Of thilke fader blessed moote he be
  
That for vs deyde  vp on a croys of tree
Thy soule litel child  I hym bitake
ffor this nyght shaltow dyen for my sake
 I trowe  that to a norice in this cas
It had been hard  this reuthe for to se
Wel myghte a mooder  thanne han cryd allas
But nathelees  so sad and stidefast was she
That she endured  al aduersitee
And to the sergeant mekely she sayde
Haue heer agayn  youre litel yonge mayde
Gooth now quod she  and dooth my lordes heeste
And o thyng wol I prey yow of youre grace
That but my lord  forbad yow atte leeste
Burieth this litel body  in som place
That beestes ne no briddes  it torace
But he no word  wol to that purpos seye
But took the child  and wente vpon his weye
 This sergeant cam vnto his lord ageyn  
And of Grisildis wordes  and hire cheere
He tolde hym point for point in short and pleyn
And hym presenteth  with his doghter deere
Somwhat this lord  hath routhe in his manere
But nathelees  his purpos heeld he stille
As lordes doon  whan they wol han hir wille
And bad his sergeant that he pryuely
Sholde this child  softe wynde and wrappe
With alle circumstances  tendrely
And carie it in a cofre  or in a lappe
But vpon peyne  his heed of for to swappe
That no man sholde knowe  of his entente
Ne whenne  ne whider that he wente
  
But at Boloigne  to his suster deere
That thilke tyme  of Pavik was Countesse
He sholde it take  and shewe hire this mateere
Bisekynge hire  to doon hire bisynesse
This child to fostre  in alle gentillesse
And whos child that it was  he bad hym hyde
ffrom euery wight for oght þat may bityde
 The sergeant gooth  and hath fulfild this thyng
But to this Markys  now retourne we
ffor now gooth he  ful faste ymaginyng
If by his wyues cheere  he myghte se
Or by hire word aperceyue  that she
Were chaunged  but he neuere hire koude fynde
But euere in oon  ylike sad and kynde
As glad  as humble  as bisy in seruyse
And eek in loue  as she was wont to be
Was she to hym  in euery maner wyse
Ne of hir doghter noght a word spak she
Noon accident for noon aduersitee
Was seyn in hire  ne neuere hir doghter name
Ne nempned she  in ernest  nor in game
IN this estaat ther passed been foure yeer
Er she with childe was  but as god wolde
A man child she bar  by this Walter
fful gracious  and fair for to biholde
And whan that folk it to his fader tolde
Nat oonly he  but al his contree merye
Was for this child  and god they thanke and herye
Whan it was two yeer old  and fro the brest
Departed of his norice  on a day
This Markys  caughte yet another lest
  
To tempte his wyf  yet ofter if he may
O nedelees  was she tempted in assay
But wedded men  ne knowe no mesure
Whan þat they fynde  a pacient creature
 Wyf quod this Markys  ye han herd er this
My peple  sikly berth oure mariage
And namely  sith my sone yborn is
Now is it worse  than euere in al oure age
The murmure sleeth myn herte and my corage
ffor to myne eres  comth the voys so smerte
That it wel ny  destroyed hath myn herte
 Now sey they thus  whan Walter is agon
Thanne shal  the blood of Ianicle succede
And been oure lord  for oother haue we noon
Swiche wordes  seith my peple out of drede
Wel oughte I  of swich murmur taken heede
ffor certeinly  I drede swich sentence
Though they nat pleyn  speke in myn Audience
I wolde lyue in pees  if that I myghte
Wherfore  I am disposed outrely
As I his suster serued by nyghte
Right so thenke I  to serue hym pryuely
This warne I yow  þat ye nat sodeynly
Out of youre self for no wo sholde outreye
Beth pacient and ther of I yow preye
 I haue quod she seyd thus  and euere shal
I wol no thyng ne nyl no thyng certayn
But as yow list naught greueth me at al
Though þat my doughter and my sone be slayn
At youre comandement this is to sayn
I haue noght had no part of children tweyne
But first siknesse  and after wo and peyne
  
Ye been oure lord  dooth with youre owene thyng  
Right as yow list axeth no reed at me
ffor as I lefte at hoom  al my clothyng
Whan I first cam to yow right so quod she
Lefte I my wyl  and al my libertee
And took youre clothyng wherfore I yow preye
Dooth youre plesance  I wol youre lust obeye
And certes  if I hadde prescience
Youre wyl to knowe  er ye youre lust me tolde
I wolde it doon  with outen necligence
But now I woot youre lust and what ye wolde
Al youre plesance  ferme and stable I holde
ffor wiste I  that my deeth  wolde do yow ese
Right gladly  wolde I dyen yow to plese
Deth may noght make no comparisoun
Vnto youre loue  and whan this Markys say
The constance of his wyf  he caste adoun
Hise eyen two  and wondreth þat she may
In pacience  suffre al this array
And forth he goth  with drery contenance
But to his herte  it was ful greet plesance
 This vgly sergeant in the same wyse
That he hire doghter caughte  right so he
Or worse  if men worse kan deuyse
Hath hent hire sone  þat ful was of beautee
And euere in oon  so pacient was she
That she no chiere maade  of heuynesse
But kiste hir sone  and after gan it blesse
Saue this  she preyde hym  that if he myghte
Hir litel sone  he wolde in erthe graue
His tendre lymes  delicaat to sighte
ffro foweles and fro beestes for to saue
  
But she noon answere  of hym myghte haue
He wente his wey  as hym no thyng ne roghte
But to Boloigne  he tendrely it broghte
This Markys  wondred euere lenger the moore
Vp on hir pacience  and if that he
Ne hadde soothly  knowen ther bifoore
That parfitly  hir children loued she
He wolde haue wend  þat of som subtiltee
And of malice  or for crueel corage
That she hadde suffred this with sad visage
But wel he knew  that next hym self certayn  
She loued hir children best in euery wyse
But new of wommen  wolde I axen fayn
If thise assayes  myghte nat suffise
What koude a sturdy housbonde moore deuyse
To preeue hire wyfhod  or hir stedefastnesse
And he continuynge euere in sturdinesse
But ther been folk of swich condicion
That whan they haue  a certein purpos take
They kan nat stynte of hire entencion
But right as they were bounden to that stake
They wol nat of that firste purpos slake
Right so this Markys  fulliche hath purposed
To tempte his wyf as he was first disposed
He waiteth  if by word  or contenance
That she to hym  was changed of corage
But neuere  koude he fynde variance
She was ay oon  in herte and in visage
And ay the forther  þat she was in age
The moore trewe  if þat it were possible
She was to hym in loue  and moore penyble
  
ffor which it semed thus  þat of hem two
Ther nas but o wyl  for as walter leste
The same lust was hire plesance also
And god be thanked  al fil for the beste
She shewed wel  for no worldly vnreste
A wyf as of hir self no thing ne sholde
Wille in effect but as hir housbonde wolde
 The sclaundre of Walter  ofte and wyde spradde
That of a crueel herte  he wikkedly
ffor he a poure womman wedded hadde
Hath mordred  bothe his children priuely
Swich murmure  was among hem comunly
No wonder is  for to the peples ere
Ther cam no word  but þat they mordred were
ffor which  where as his peple ther bifore
Hadde loued hym wel  the sclaundre of his diffame
Made hem  that they hym hated therfore
To been a mordrere is an hateful name
But nathelees  for ernest ne for game
He of his crueel purpos nolde stente
To tempte his wyf was set al his entente
 Whan that his doghter xij yeer was of age  
He to the court of Rome in subtil wyse
Enformed of his wyl  sente his message
Comaundynge hem  swiche bulles to deuyse
As to his crueel purpos may suffyse
How þat the pope  as for his peples reste
Bad hym to wedde  another if hym leste
I seye  he bad they sholde countrefete
The popes bulles  makynge mencion
That he hath leue  his firste wyf to lete
As by the popes dispensacion
  
To stynte rancour and dissencion
Bitwixe his peple and hym  thus seyde the bulle
The which  they han publiced atte fulle
 The rude peple  as it no wonder is
Wenden ful wel  that it hadde be right so
But whan thise tidynges cam to Grisildis
I deeme  that hire herte was ful wo
But she  ylike sad for eueremo
Disposed was  this humble creature
The aduersitee of ffortune al tendure
Abidynge euere  his lust and his plesance
To whom þat she was yeuen  herte and al
As to hire verray worldly suffisance
But shortly  if this storie I tellen shal
This Markys  writen hath in special
A lettre  in which he sheweth his entente
And secreely he to Boloigne it sente
To the Erl of Pavyk which þat hadde tho
Wedded his suster preyde he specially
To bryngen hoom agayn hise children two
In honurable estaat al openly
But o thyng he hym preyde outrely
That he to no wight though men wolde enquere
Sholde nat telle  whos children þat they were
But seye  the mayden  sholde ywedded be
Vnto the Markys  of Saluce anon
And as this Erl was preyd  so dide he
ffor at day set he on his wey is goon
Toward Saluce  and lordes many oon
In riche array this mayden for to gyde
Hir yonge brother ridynge hire bisyde
  
 Arrayed was toward hir mariage  
This fresshe mayde  ful of gemmes cleere
Hir brother  which þat vij yeer was of age
Arrayed eek  ful fressh in his manere
And thus in greet noblesse  and with glad cheere
Toward Saluces  shapynge hir iourney
ffro day to day  they ryden in hir wey
Among al this  after his wikke vsage
This Markys yet his wyf to tempte moore
To the outtreste preeue  of hir corage
ffully  to han experience and loore
If that she were  as stidefast as bifoore
He on a day  in open audience
fful boistously haþ seyd hire this sentence
 Certes Grisilde  I hadde ynogh plesance
To han yow to my wyf for youre goodnesse
As for youre trouthe  and for youre obeisance
Noght for youre lynage  ne for youre richesse
But now knowe I  in verray soothfastnesse
That in greet lordshipe  if I wel auyse
Ther is greet seruitute  in sondry wyse
I may nat doon  as euery Plowman may
My peple  me constreyneth for to take
Another wyf and crien day by day
And eek the pope  rancour for to slake
Consenteth it that dar I vndertake
And treweliche  thus muche I wol yow seye
My newe wyf is comynge by the weye
Be strong of herte  and voyde anon hir place
And thilke dowere  that ye broghten me
Taak it agayn  I graunte it of my grace
  
Retourneth  to youre fadres hous quod he
No man  may alwey han prosperitee
With euene herte  I rede yow tendure
This strook of ffortune  or of auenture
 And she answerde agayn in pacience  
My lord quod she  I woot and wiste alway
How þat  bitwixen youre magnificence
And my pouerte  no wight kan ne may
Maken comparison  it is no nay
I ne heeld me neuere digne in no manere
To be youre wyf  no ne youre Chambrere
And in this hous  ther ye me lady maade
The heighe god  take I for my witnesse
And also wysly  he my soule glaade
I neuere  heeld me lady  ne maistresse
But humble seruant to youre worthynesse
And euere shal  whil þat my lyf may dure
Abouen  euery worldly creature
That ye so longe  of youre benignitee
Han holden me  in honour and nobleye
Where as I was  noght worthy bee
That thonke I god  and yow  to whom I preye
fforyelde it yow  ther is namoore to seye
Vnto my fader gladly wol I wende
And with hym dwelle  vnto my lyues ende
Ther I was fostred  of a child ful smal
Til I be deed  my lyf ther wol I lede
A wydwe clene  in body  herte and al
ffor sith I yaf to yow my maydenhede
And am youre trewe wyf it is no drede
God shilde  swich a lordes wyf to take
Another man  to housbonde  or to make
  
And of youre newe wyf  god of his grace
So graunte yow wele and prosperitee
ffor I wol gladly  yelden hire my place
In which that I was blisful wont to bee
ffor sith it liketh yow  my lord quod shee
That whilom weren  al myn hertes reste
That I shal goon  I wol goon whan yow leste
But ther as ye me profre  swich dowaire
As I first broghte  it is wel in my mynde
It were my wrecched clothes no thyng faire
The whiche to me  were hard now for to fynde
O goode god  how gentil and how kynde
Ye semed  by youre speche  and youre visage
The day  that maked was oure mariage
But sooth is seyd  algate I fynde it trewe  
ffor in effect it preeued is on me
Loue is noght oold  as whan þat it is newe
But certes lord  for noon aduersitee
To dyen in the cas  it shal nat bee
That euere  in word or werk  I shal repente
That I yow yaf myn herte in hool entente
My lord ye woot  that in my fadres place
Ye dide me streepe  out of my poure weede
And richely  me cladden of youre grace
To yow broghte I noght elles  out of drede
But feith and nakednesse  and maydenhede
And heere agayn  my clothyng I restoore
And eek  my weddyng ryng for eueremore
The remenant of youre Iueles redy be
In with youre chambre  dar I saufly sayn
Naked  out of my fadres hous quod she
I cam  and naked moot I turne agayn
  
Al youre plesance  wol I folwen fayn
But yet I hope  it be nat youre entente
That I smoklees  out of youre paleys wente
Ye koude nat doon  so dishoneste a thyng
That thilke wombe  in which youre children leye
Sholde biforn the peple  in my walkyng
Be seyn al bare  wherfore I yow preye
Lat me  nat lyk a worm  go by the weye
Remembre yow  myn owene lord so deere
I was youre wyf  though I vnworthy weere
Wherfore  in gerdon of my maydenhede
Which þat I broghte  and noght agayn I bere
As voucheth sauf  to yeue me  to my meede
But swich a smok as I was wont to were
That I therwith may wrye the wombe of here
That was youre wyf  and heer take I my leeue
Of yow myn owene lord  lest I yow greue
 The smok quod he  that thou hast on thy bak
Lat it be stille  and bere it forth with thee
But wel vnnethes  thilke word he spak
But wente his wey  for routhe and for pitee
Biforn the folk hir seluen strepeth she
And in hir smok with heed  and foot  al bare
Toward hir fader hous  forth is she fare
 The folk hire folwe  wepynge in hir weye  
And ffortune ay they cursen  as they goon
But she fro wepyng kepte hire eyen dreye
Ne in this tyme  word ne spak she noon
Hir fader  that this tidynge herde anoon
Curseth the day  and tyme that nature
Shoope hym  to been a lyues creature
  
ffor out of doute  this olde poure man
Was euere  in suspect of hir mariage
ffor euere he demed  sith that it bigan
That whan the lord  fulfild hadde his corage
Hym wolde thynke  it were a disparage
To his estaat  so lowe for talighte
And voyden hire  as soone as euer he myghte
Agayns his doghter  hastiliche goth he
ffor he by noyse of folk  knew hire comynge
And with hire olde coote  as it myghte be
He couered hire  ful sorwefully wepynge
But on hire body  myghte he it nat brynge
ffor rude was the clooth  and she moore of age
By dayes fele  than at hire mariage
 Thus with hire fader  for a certeyn space
Dwelleth this flour of wyfly pacience
That neither by hire wordes  ne hire face
Biforn the folk  ne eek in hire absence
Ne shewed she  that hire was doon offence
Ne of hire heighe estaat no remembrance
Ne hadde she  as by hire contenance
No wonder is  for in hire grete estaat
Hire goost was euere  in pleyn humylitee
No tendre mouth  noon herte delicaat
No pompe  no semblant of roialtee
But ful of pacient benyngnytee
Discreet and pridelees  ay honurable
And to hire housbonde  euere meke and stable
 Men speke of Iob  and moost for his humblesse
As clerkes whan hem list konne wel endite
Namely of men  but as in soothfastnesse
Though clerkes  preise wommen but a lite
  
Ther kan no man  in humblesse hym acquite
As womman kan  ne been half so trewe
As wommen been  but it be falle of newe
 ffro Boloigne  is this Erl of Pavyk come  
Of which the fame vp sprang to moore and lesse
And in the peples eres  alle and some
Was kouth eek  that a newe Markysesse
He with hym broghte  in swich pompe and richesse
That neuere was ther seyn  with mannes eye
So noble array  in al Westlumbardye
 The Markys  which that shoope and knew al this
Er that this Erl was come  sente his message
ffor thilke  sely poure Grisildis
And she with humble herte  and glad visage
Nat with no swollen thoght in hire corage
Cam at his heste  and on hire knees hire sette
And reuerently  and wisely she hym grette
 Grisilde quod he  my wyl is outrely
This mayden  that shal wedded been to me
Receiued be  to morwe as roially
As it possible is  in myn hous to be
And eek  that euery wight in his degree
Haue his estaat in sittyng and seruyse
And heigh plesance  as I kan best deuyse
 I haue no wommen  suffisant certayn
The chambres  for tarraye in ordinance
After my lust and therfore wolde I fayn
That thyn were  al swich manere gouernance
Thou knowest eek of old al my plesance
Thogh thyn array be badde and yuel biseye
Do thou thy deuoir  at the leeste weye
  
 Nat oonly lord  that I am glad quod she
To doon youre lust but I desire also
Yow for to serue  and plese in my degree
With outen feyntyng and shal eueremo
Ne neuere  for no wele  ne no wo
Ne shal the goost withInne myn herte stente
To loue yow best with al my trewe entente
And with that word  she gan the hous to dighte
And tables for to sette  and beddes make
And peyned hire  to doon al that she myghte
Preyynge the chambreres  for goddes sake
To hasten hem  and faste swepe and shake
And she  the mooste seruysable of alle
Hath euery chambre arrayed  and his halle
 Abouten vndren  gan this Erl alighte  
That with him broghte  thise noble children tweye
ffor which the peple  ran to seen the sighte
Of hire array  so richely biseye
And thanne at erst amonges hem they seye
That Walter was no fool  thogh þat hym leste
To chaunge his wyf for it was for the beste
ffor she is fairer  as they deemen alle
Than is Grisilde  and moore tendre of age
And fairer fruyt bitwene hem sholde falle
And moore plesant for hire heigh lynage
Hir brother eek so faire was of visage
That hem to seen  the peple hath caught plesance
Commendynge now  the Markys gouernance
O Stormy peple  vnsad  and euere vntrewe
Ay vndiscreet and chaungynge as a vane
Delitynge euere  in rumbul that is newe
ffor lyk the moone  ay wexe ye and wane
  
Ay ful of clappyng deere ynogh a Iane
Youre doom is fals  youre constance yuele preeueth
A ful greet fool  is he  þat on yow leeueth
Thus seyden sadde folk in that Citee
Whan that the peple  gazed vp and doun
ffor they were glad  right for the noueltee
To han  a newe lady of hir toun
Namoore of this  make I now mencioun
But to Grisilde agayn  wol I me dresse
And telle  hir constance  and hir bisynesse
 fful bisy was Grisilde  in euery thyng
That to the feeste  was apertinent
Right noght was she abayst of hire clothyng
Thogh it were rude  and somdeel eek torent
But with glad cheere  to the yate is she went
With oother folk to greete the Markysesse
And after that dooth forth hire bisynesse
With so glad chiere  hise gestes she receyueth
And so konnyngly  euerich in his degree
That no defaute  no man aperceyueth
But ay they wondren  what she myghte bee
That in so poure array was for to see
And koude  swich honour and reuerence
And worthily  they preisen hire prudence
In al this meene while  she ne stente  
This mayde  and eek hir brother to commende
With al hir herte  in ful benyngne entente
So wel  þat no man koude hir pris amende
But atte laste  whan þat thise lordes wende
To sitten doun to mete  he gan to calle
Grisilde  as she was bisy in his halle
  
 Grisilde quod he  as it were in his pley
How liketh thee my wyf and hire beautee
Right wel quod she my lord  for in good fey
A fairer saugh I neuere noon than she
I prey to god  yeue hire prosperitee
And so hope I  that he wol to yow sende
Plesance ynogh  vnto youre lyues ende
O thyng biseke I yow  and warne also
That ye ne prikke  with no tormentynge
This tendre mayden  as ye han doon mo
ffor she is fostred  in hire norissynge
Moore tendrely  and to my supposynge
She koude nat aduersitee endure
As koude  a poure fostred creature
 And whan this Walter  saugh hire pacience
Hir glad chiere  and no malice at al
And he so ofte  had doon to hire 
And she ay sad  and constant as a wal
Continuynge euere  hire Innocence oueral
This sturdy Markys  gan his herte dresse
To rewen  vp on hire wyfly stedfastnesse
 This is ynogh  Grisilde myn quod he
Be now namoore agast ne yuele apayed
I haue thy feith  and thy benyngnytee
As wel  as euere womman was assayed
In greet estaat and poureliche arrayed
Now knowe I goode wyf  thy stedfastnesse
And hire in armes took  and gan hire kesse
 And she for wonder took of it no keepe
She herde nat  what thyng he to hire seyde
She ferde  as she had stert out of a sleepe
Til she  out of hire mazednesse abreyde
  
Grisilde quod he  by god that for vs deyde
Thou art my wyf noon oother I haue
Ne neuere hadde  as god my soule saue
 This is thy doghter  which thou hast supposed  
To be my wyf  that oother feithfully
Shal be myn heir  as I haue ay supposed
Thou bare hym  in thy body trewely
At Boloigne  haue I kept hem priuely
Taak hem agayn  for now maystow nat seye
That thou hast lorn  noon of thy children tweye
And folk  that ootherweys  han seyd of me
I warne hem wel  þat I haue doon this deede
ffor no malice  ne for no crueltee
But for tassaye  in thee thy wommanheede
And nat to sleen my children  god forbeede
But for to kepe hem  pryuely and stille
Til I thy purpos knewe  and al thy wille
 Whan she this herde  aswowne doun she falleth
ffor pitous Ioye  and after hire swownynge
She bothe hire yonge children  vnto hire calleth
And in hire Armes  pitously wepynge
Embraceth hem  and tendrely kissynge
fful lyk a mooder with hire salte teeres
She bathed  bothe hire visage and hire heeres
 O which a pitous thyng it was to se
Hir swownyng and hire humble voys to heere
Grauntmercy lord  that thanke I yow quod she
That ye han saued me my children deere
Now rekke I neuere  to been deed right heere
Sith I stonde in youre loue  and in youre grace
No fors of deeth  ne whan my spirit pace
  
 O tendre  o deere  o yonge children myne
Youre woful mooder  wende stedfastly
That crueel houndes  or som foul vermyne
Hadde eten yow  but god of his mercy
And youre benyngne fader  tendrely
Hath doon yow kept and in that same stounde
Al sodeynly  she swapte adoun to grounde
And in hire swough  so sadly holdeth she
Hire children two  whan she gan hem tembrace
That with greet sleighte  and greet difficultee
The children  from hire arm they gonne arace
O many a teere  on many a pitous face
Doun ran  of hem þat stooden hire bisyde
Vnnethe abouten hire  myghte they abyde
 Walter hire gladeth  and hire sorwe slaketh  
She riseth vp abaysed  from hire trance
And euery wight  hire ioye and feeste maketh
Til she  hath caught agayn hire contenance
Walter hire dooth  so feithfully plesance
That it was deyntee  for to seen the cheere
Bitwixe hem two  now they been met yfeere
 Thise ladyes  whan that they hir tyme say
Han taken hire  and in to chambre gon
And strepen hire  out of hire rude array
And in a clooth of gold  þat brighte shoon
With a coroune  of many a riche stoon
Vp on hire heed  they in to halle hire broghte
And ther she was  honured as hire oghte
Thus hath this pitous day a blisful ende
ffor euery man and womman dooth his myght
This day  in murthe and reuel to dispende
Til on the welkne  shoon the sterres lyght
  
ffor moore solempne  in euery mannes syght
This feste was  and gretter of costage
Than was  the reuel  of hire mariage
 fful many a yeer  in heigh prosperitee
Lyuen thise two  in concord and in reste
And richely  his doghter maryed he
Vnto a lord  oon of the worthieste
Of al Ytaille  and thanne in pees and reste
His wyues fader in his court he kepeth
Til that the soule  out of his body crepeth
His sone  succedeth in his heritage
In reste and pees  after his fader day
And fortunat was eek in mariage
Al putte he nat his wyf in greet assay
This world is nat so strong it is no nay
As it hath been  of olde tymes yoore
And herkneth  what this Auctour seith therfoore
 This storie is seyd  nat for that wyues sholde
ffolwen Grisilde  as in humylitee
ffor it were inportable  though they wolde
But for that euery wight in his degree
Sholde be constant in aduersitee
As was Grisilde  therfore petrak writeth
This storie  which with heigh stile he enditeth
ffor sith a womman  was so pacient  
Vnto a mortal man  wel moore vs oghte
Receyuen al in gree  that god vs sent
ffor greet skile is  he preeue that he wroghte
But he  ne tempteth no man  that he boghte
As seith seint Iame  if ye his pistel rede
He preeueth folk al day  it is no drede
  
And suffreth vs  as for oure excercise
With sharpe scourges  of Aduersitee
fful ofte  to be bete in sondry wise
Nat for to know oure wyl  for certes he
Er we were born  knew oure freletee
And for oure beste  is al his gouernance
Lat vs thanne lyue  in vertuous suffrance
 But o word lordynges  herkneth er I go
It were ful hard  to fynde now a dayes
In al a toun  Grisildis  thre or two
ffor if þat they were put to swiche assayes
The gold of hem  hath now so badde alayes
With bras  þat thogh the coyne be fair at eye
It wolde rather  breste atwo than plye
ffor which heere  for the wyues loue of Bathe
Whos lyf and al hire secte god mayntene
In heigh maistrie  and elles were it scathe
I wol with lusty herte  fressh and grene
Seyn yow a song to glade yow I wene
And lat vs stynte  of ernestful matere
Herkneth my song that seith in this manere
Grisilde is deed  and eek hire pacience
And bothe atones  buryed in Ytaille
ffor which I crie  in open audience
No wedded man  so hardy be tassaille
His wyues pacience  in hope to fynde
Grisildis  for in certein he shal faille
  
O noble wyues  ful  of heigh prudence
Lat noon humylitee  youre tonge naill
Ne lat no clerk haue cause or diligence
To write of yow  a storie of swich meruaille
As of Grisildis  pacient and kynde
Lest Chichiuache  yow swelwe in hire entraille
ffolweth Ekko  that holdeth no silence  
But euere answereth  at the countretaille
Beth nat bidaffed for youre Innocence
But sharply  taak on yow the gouernaille
Emprenteth wel this lesson in youre mynde
ffor commune profit sith it may auaille
Ye Archiwyues  stondeth at defense
Syn ye be strong as is a greet Camaille
Ne suffreth nat þat men yow doon offense
And sklendre wyues  fieble as in bataille
Beth egre  as is a Tygre yond in Ynde
Ay clappeth as a Mille  I yow consaille
Ne dreed hem nat doth hem no reuerence
ffor though thyn housbonde  armed be in maille
The arwes  of thy crabbed eloquence
Shal perce his brest and eek his Auentaille
In Ialousie  I rede eek thou hym bynde
And thou shalt make hym couche as doth a quaille
If thou be fair ther folk been in presence
Shewe thou thy visage  and thyn apparaille
If thou be foul  be fre of thy dispence
To gete thee freendes  ay do thy trauaille
Be ay of chiere  as light as leef on lynde
And lat hym care and wepe  and wryng and waille
    
THis worthy clerk whan ended was his tale
Oure hoost seyde  and swoor by goddes bones
Me were leuere  than a barel ale
My wyf at hoom  had herd this legende ones
This is a gentil tale  for the nones
As to my purpos  wiste ye my wille
But thyng þat wol nat be  lat it be stille
Wepyng and waylyng care and oother sorwe
I knowe ynogh  on euen and a morwe
Quod the Marchant and so doon othere mo
That wedded been  I trowe that it be so
ffor wel I woot it fareth so with me
I have a wyf the worste that may be
ffor thogh the feend  to hire ycoupled were
She wolde hym ouermacche  I dar wel swere
What sholde I yow reherce in special
Hir hye malice  she is a shrewe at al
Ther is a long and large difference
Bitwix Grisildis grete pacience
And of my wyf the passyng crueltee
Were I vnbounden  al so moot I thee
I wolde neuere eft comen in the snare
We wedded men  lyue in sorwe and care
Assaye who so wole  and he shal fynde
I seye sooth  by seint Thomas of ynde
As for the moore part I sey nat alle
God shilde  that it sholde so bifalle
 A good sire hoost  I haue ywedded bee
Thise Monthes two  and moore nat pardee
And yet I trowe  he that al his lyue
Wyflees hath been  though þat men wolde him ryue
Vnto the herte  ne koude in no manere
Tellen so muchel  sorwe  as I now heere
Koude tellen  of my wyues cursednesse
 Now quod our hoost Marchant so god yow blesse
Syn ye so muchel  knowen of that Art
fful hertely  I pray yow telle vs part
 Gladly quod he  but of myn owene soore
ffor soory herte  I telle may namoore

WHilom ther was dwellynge in Lumbardye
A worthy knyght þat born was of Pavye
In which he lyued  in greet prosperitee
And sixty yeer  a wyflees man was hee
And folwed ay his bodily delyt
On wommen  ther as was his appetyt
As doon thise fooles  that been seculeer  
And whan that he  was passed sixty yeer
Were it for hoolynesse  or for dotage
I kan nat seye  but swich a greet corage
Hadde this knyght to been a wedded man
That day and nyght he dooth al that he kan
Tespien  where he myghte wedded be
Preyinge oure lord  to granten him þat he
Mighte ones knowe  of thilke blisful lyf
That is bitwixe  an housbonde  and his wyf 
And for to lyue  vnder that hooly boond
With which þat first god  man and womman bond
Noon oother lyf seyde he  is worth a bene
ffor wedlok is so esy  and so clene
That in this world  it is a Paradys
Thus seyde this olde knyght  þat was so wys
 And certeinly  as sooth  as god is kyng
To take a wyf it is a glorious thyng
And namely  whan a man  is oold and hoor
Thanne is a wyf the fruyt of his tresor
Thanne sholde he take  a yong wyf and a feir
On which  he myghte  engendren hym an heir
  
And lede his lyf in ioye and in solas
Where as thise bacheleris  synge allas
Whan that they fynden  any aduersitee
In loue  which nys  but childyssh vanytee
And trewely  it sit wel to be so
That bacheleris  haue often peyne and wo
On brotel ground they buylde  and brotelnesse
They fynde  whan they wene sikernesse
They lyue  but as a bryd  or as a beest
In libertee  and vnder noon arreest
Ther as a wedded man  in his estaat
Lyueth a lyf blisful and ordinaat
Vnder this yok of mariage ybounde
Wel may his herte  in ioye and blisse habounde
ffor who kan be  so buxom as a wyf
Who is so trewe  and eek so ententyf
To kepe hym syk and hool  as is his make
ffor wele or wo  she wole hym nat forsake
She nys nat wery  hym to loue and serue
Thogh þat he lye bedrede  til he sterue
And yet somme clerkes seyn  it nys nat so
Of whiche  he Theofraste is oon of tho
What force  though Theofraste liste lye
Ne take no wyf quod he  for housbondrye
As for to spare  in houshold thy dispence
A trewe seruant dooth moore diligence
Thy good to kepe  than thyn owene wyf  
ffor she wol clayme  half part al hir lyf
And if thou be syk so god me saue
Thy verray freendes  or a trewe knaue
Wol kepe thee bet than she þat waiteth ay
After thy good  and hath doon many a day
And if thou take a wyf  vnto thyn hoold
fful lightly  maystow been a Cokewold
This sentence  and an hundred thynges worse
Writeth this man  ther god his bones corse
  
But take no kepe  of al swich vanytee
Deffie Theofraste  and herke me
 A wyf is goddes yifte verraily
Alle otherere manere yiftes hardily
As londes  rentes  pasture  or commune
Or moebles  alle been yiftes of ffortune
That passen  as a shadwe vpon a wal
But dredelees  if pleynly speke I shal
A wyf wol laste  and in thyn hous endure
Wel lenger than thee list parauenture
 Mariage is  a ful greet sacrement
He  which þat hath no wyf  I holde hym shent
He lyueth helplees  and al desolat
I speke of folk in seculer estaat
And herke why  I sey nat this for noght
That womman is  for mannes helpe ywroght
The hye god  whan he hadde Adam maked
And saugh him al allone  bely naked
God of his grete goodnesse  seyde than
Lat vs now make an helpe vnto this man
Lyk to hym self and thanne he made him Eue
Heere may ye se  and heerby may ye preue
That wyf is mannes helpe  and his confort
His Paradys terrestre  and his disport
So buxom  and so vertuous is she
They moste nedes  lyue in vnitee
O flessh they been  and o flessh as I gesse
Hath but oon herte  in wele and in distresse
 A wyf  a Seinte marie benedicite
How myghte a man  han any aduersitee
That hath a wyf certes I kan nat seye
The blisse  which þat is bitwixe hem tweye
Ther may no tonge telle  or herte thynke
If he be poure  she helpeth hym to swynke
She kepeth his good  and wasteth neuer a deel
Al that hire housbonde lust hire liketh weel
  
She seith not ones nay  whan he seith ye
Do this seith he  al redy sire seith she
O blisful ordre of wedlok precious  
Thou art so murye  and eek so vertuous
And so commended  and appreued eek
That euery man  þat halt hym worth a leek 
Vp on his bare knees  oughte al his lyf 
Thanken his god  þat hym hath sent a wyf 
Or elles preye to god  hym for to sende
A wyf  to laste  vn to his lyues ende
ffor thanne his lyf  is set in sikernesse
He may nat be deceyued as I gesse
So þat he werke  after his wyues reede
    
    
    
    
 Lo how þat Iacob  as thise clerkes rede
By good conseil  of his mooder Rebekke
Boond the kydes skyn  aboute his nekke
Thurgh which  his fadres benyson he wan
 Lo Iudith  as the storie eek telle kan
By wys conseil  she goddes peple kepte
And slow hym Olofernus  whil he slepte
 Lo Abigayl  by good conseil  how she
Saued hir housbonde Nabal  whan þat he
Sholde han be slayn  and looke Ester also
By good conseil  delyuered out of wo
The peple of god  and made hym Mardochee
Of Assuere  enhaunced for to be
 Ther nys no thyng in gree superlatyf
As seith Senek aboue an humble wyf
 Suffre thy wyues tonge  as Caton bit
She shal comande  and thou shalt suffren it
And yet she wole obeye of curteisye
A wyf is kepere  of thyn housbondrye  
Wel may the sike man  biwaille and wepe
Ther as ther nys no wyf  the hous to kepe
I warne thee  if wisely  thou wolt wirche
Loue wel thy wyf as crist loued his chirche
If thou louest thy self thou louest thy wyf
No man hateth his flessh  but in his lyf
He fostreth it and therfore bidde I thee
Cherisse thy wyf  or thou shalt neuere thee
Housbonde and wyf what so men iape or pleye
Of worldly folk  holden the siker weye
They been so knyt ther may noon harm bityde
And namely  vp on the wyues syde
ffor which this Ianuarie  of whom I tolde
Considered hath  inwith hise dayes olde
The lusty lyf  the vertuous quyete
That is in mariage hony sweete
And for hise freendes  on a day he sente
To tellen hem theffect of his entente
With face sad  his tale he hath hem toold  
He seyde freendes  I am hoor and oold
And almoost god woot on my pittes brynke
Vp on the soule  somwhat moste I thynke
I haue my body  folily despended
Blessed be god  that it shal been amended
ffor I wol be  certeyn a wedded man
And that anoon  in al the haste I kan
Vn to som mayde  fair  and tendre of age
I prey yow  shapeth for my mariage
Al sodeynly  for I wol nat abyde
And I wol fonde  tespien on my syde
To whom  I may be wedded hastily
But for as muche  as ye been mo than I
Ye shullen rather  swich a thyng espyen
Than I  and where me best were to allyen
 But o thyng warne I yow  my freendes deere
I wol noon oold wyf han  in no manere
  
She shal nat passe twenty yeer certayn
Oold fissh and yong flessh  wolde I haue fayn
Bet is quod he  a pyk than a pykerel
And bet than olde boef is the tendre veel
I wol no womman  thritty yeer of age
It is but benestraw  and greet forage
And eek thise olde wydwes  god it woot
They konne  so muchel craft on Wades boot
So muchel broken harm  whan þat hem leste
That with hem  sholde I neuere lyue in reste
ffor sondry scoles  maken sotile clerkis
Womman of manye scoles  half a clerk is
But certeynly  a yong thyng may men gye
Right as men may  warm wex with handes plye
Wherfore  I sey yow pleynly  in a clause
I wol noon oold wyf han  for this cause
ffor if so were  þat I hadde swich myschance
That I in hire  ne koude han no plesance
Thanne sholde I lede my lyf in Auoutrye
And streight vnto the deuel  whan I dye
Ne children  sholde I none vp on hire geten
Yet were me leuere  þat houndes had me eten
Than þat myn heritage sholde falle
In straunge hand  and this I telle yow alle
I dote nat I woot the cause why
Men sholde wedde  and forthermoore woot I
Ther speketh  many a man of mariage
That woot namoore of it than woot my page
ffor whiche causes  man sholde take a wyf 
Siththe  he may nat lyuen chaast his lyf 
Take hym a wyf with greet deuocion  
By cause  of leueful procreacion
Of children  to thonour of god aboue
And nat oonly  for paramour or loue
And for they sholde  leccherye eschue
And yelde hir dettes  whan þat they ben due
  
Or for that ech of hem  sholde helpen oother
In meschief  as a suster shal the brother
And lyue in chastitee  ful holily
But sires by youre leue  that am nat I
ffor god be thanked  I dar make auaunt
I feele my lymes  stark and suffisaunt
To do  al that a man bilongeth to
I woot my seluen best what I may do
Though I be hoor  I fare as dooth a tree
That blosmeth  er þat fruyt ywoxen bee
And blosmy tree  nys neither drye ne deed
I feele me  nowhere hoor  but on myn heed
Myn herte  and alle my lymes been as grene
As laurer  thurgh the yeer  is for to sene
And syn þat ye  han herd al myn entente
I prey yow  to my wyl  ye wole assente
Diuerse men  diuersely hym tolde
Of mariage  manye ensamples olde
Somme blamed it  somme preysed it certeyn
But atte laste  shortly for to seyn
As al day  falleth altercacion
Bitwixen freendes in disputison
Ther fil a stryf  bitwixe hise bretheren two
Of whiche  that oon was cleped Placebo
Iustinus soothly  called was that oother
 Placebo seyde  o Ianuarie brother
fful litel nede  hadde ye my lord so deere
Conseil to axe  of any that is heere
But þat ye been  so ful of sapience
That yow ne liketh  for youre heighe prudence
To weyuen  fro the word of Salomon
This word seyde he  vn to vs euerychon
Wirk alle thyng by conseil  thus seyde he
And thanne  shaltow nat repente thee
But though þat Salomon  spak swich a word
Myn owene deere brother  and my lord
  
So wysly  god my soule brynge at reste
I holde  youre owene conseil is the beste
ffor brother myn  of me taak this motyf
I haue now been  a Court man al my lyf
And god it woot though I vnworthy be
I haue stonden  in ful greet degree
Abouten lordes  of ful heigh estaat  
Yet hadde I neuere  with noon of hem debaat
I neuere hem contraried trewely
I woot wel  that my lord kan moore than I
What that he seith  I holde it ferme and stable
I seye the same  or elles thyng semblable
A ful greet fool  is any conseillour
That serueth any lord  of heigh honour
That dar presume  or elles thenken it
That his conseil  sholde passe his lordes wit
Nay  lordes been no fooles by my fay
Ye han youre seluen  seyd heer to day
So heigh sentence  so holily and weel
That I consente  and conferme euerydeel
Youre wordes alle  and youre opinioun
By god  ther nys no man  in al this toun
Nyn Ytaille  that koude bet han sayd
Crist halt hym  of this conseil ful wel apayd
And trewely  it is an heigh corage
Of any man  that stapen is in age
To take a yong wyf by my fader kyn
Youre herte hangeth  on a ioly pyn
Dooth now in this matiere  right as yow leste
ffor finally  I holde it for the beste
Iustinus  þat ay stille sat and herde
Right in this wise  he to Placebo answerde
Now brother myn  be pacient I preye
Syn ye han seyd  and herkneth what I seye
 Senek among hise othere wordes wyse
Seith  þat a man oghte hym right wel auyse
  
To whom  he yeueth his lond  or his catel
And syn I oghte  auyse me right wel
To whom I yeue my good  awey fro me
Wel muchel moore  I oghte auysed be
To whom I yeue my body  for alwey
I warne yow wel  it is no childes pley
To take a wyf withouten auysement
Men moste enquere  this is myn assent
Wher she be wys  or sobre  or dronkelewe
Or proud  or elles ootherweys a shrewe
A chidestere  or wastour of thy good
Or riche  or poore  or elles mannyssh wood
Al be it so  that no man fynden shal
Noon in this world  that trotteth hool in al
Ne man ne beest which as men koude deuyse
But nathelees  it oghte ynough suffise
With any wyf if so were that she hadde
Mo goode thewes  than hire vices badde
And al this  axeth leyser  for tenquere  
ffor god it woot I haue wept many a teere
fful pryuely  syn I haue had a wyf
Preyse who so wole  a wedded mannes lyf
Certein I fynde in it but cost and care
And obseruances  of alle blisses bare
And yet god woot my neighebores aboute
And namely  of wommen many a route
Seyn þat I haue  the mooste stedefast wyf
And eek the mekeste oon  that bereth lyf
But I woot best where wryngeth me my sho
Ye mowe for me  right as yow liketh do
Auyseth yow  ye been a man of age
How that ye entren  in to mariage
And namely  with a yong wyf and a fair
By hym þat made water  erthe  and air
The yongeste man  þat is in al this route
Is bisy ynough  to bryngen it aboute
  
To han his wyf allone  trusteth me
Ye shul nat plesen hire  fully yeres thre
This is to seyn  to doon hire ful plesance
A wyf axeth  ful many an obseruance
I prey yow  þat ye be nat yuele apayd
 Wel quod this Ianuarie  and hastow ysayd
Straw for thy Senek  and for thy prouerbes
I counte nat a panyer ful of herbes
Of scole termes  wyser men than thow
As thou hast herd  assenteden right now
To my purpos  Placebo  what sey ye
 I seye  it is a cursed man quod he
That letteth matrimoigne sikerly
And with that word  they rysen sodeynly
And been assented  fully þat he sholde
Be wedded  whanne hym list and where he wolde
Heigh fantasye  and curious bisynesse
ffro day to day  gan in the soule impresse
Of Ianuarie  aboute his mariage
Many fair shape  and many a fair visage
Ther passeth thurgh his herte  nyght by nyght
And who so tooke a Mirour polisshed bryght
And sette it in a commune Market place
Thanne sholde he se  ful many a figure pace
By his Mirour  and in the same wyse
Gan Ianuarie  inwith his thoght deuyse
Of maydens  whiche þat dwellen hym bisyde
He wiste nat  wher þat he myghte abyde
ffor if þat oon  haue beaute  in hir face
Another stant so  in the peples grace
ffor hire sadnesse  and hire benyngnytee  
That of the peple  grettest voys hath she
And somme were riche  and hadden badde name
But nathelees  bitwixe ernest and game
He atte laste  apoynted hym on oon
And leet alle othere  from his herte goon
  
And chees hire  of his owene auctoritee
ffor loue is blynd al day  and may nat see
And whan that he was  in his bed ybroght
He purtreyed  in his herte and in his thoght
Hir fresshe beautee  and hir age tendre
Hir myddel smal  hire armes longe and sklendre
Hir wise gouernance  hir gentillesse
Hir wommanly berynge  and hire sadnesse
And whan that he  on hire was condescended
Hym thoughte  his choys myghte nat ben amended
ffor whan þat he hym self  concluded hadde
Hym thoughte  ech oother mannes wit so badde
That inpossible  it were to repplye
Agayn his choys  this was his fantasye
Hise freendes sente he to  at his instance
And preyed hem  to doon hym that plesance
That hastily  they wolden to hym come
He wolde abregge hir labour alle and some
Nedeth namoore  for hym to go ne ryde
He was apoynted  ther he wolde abyde
 Placebo cam  and eek hise freendes soone
And alderfirst he bad hem alle a boone
That noon of hem  none Argumentes make
Agayn the purpos  which þat he hath take
Which purpos  was plesant to god seyde he
And verray ground  of his prosperitee
 He seyde  ther was a mayden in the toun
Which þat of beautee  hadde greet renoun
Al were it so  she were  of smal degree
Suffiseth hym  hir yowthe  and hir beautee
Which mayde he seyde  he wolde han to his wyf
To lede in ese  and hoolynesse his lyf
And thanked god  þat he myghte han hire al
That no wight  his blisse parten shal
And preyde hem  to laboure in this nede
And shapen  þat he faille nat to spede
  
ffor thanne he seyde  his spirit was at ese
Thanne is quod he  no thyng may me displese
Saue o thyng priketh in my conscience
The which I wol reherce  in youre presence
 I haue quod he  herd seyd ful yoore ago
Ther may no man  han parfite blisses two
This is to seye  in erthe and eek in heuene  
ffor though he kepe hym  fro the synnes seuene
And eek from euery branche of thilke tree
Yet is ther so parfit felicitee
And so greet ese  and lust in mariage
That euere I am agast now in myn age
That I shal lede now  so myrie a lyf
So delicat withouten wo and stryf
That I shal haue  myn heuene in erthe heere
ffor sith þat verray heuene  is boght so deere
With tribulacion  and greet penance
How sholde I thanne  þat lyue in swich plesance
As alle wedded men  doon with hire wyuys
Come to the blisse  ther crist eterne on lyue ys
This is my drede  and ye my bretheren tweye
Assoilleth me  this question I preye
Iustinus  which þat hated his folye
Answerde anon  right in his iaperye
And for he wolde  his longe tale abregge
He wolde  noon auctoritee allegge
But seyde sire  so ther be noon obstacle
Oother than this  god of his hygh myracle
And of his hygh mercy  may so for yow wirche
That er ye haue youre right of hooly chirche
Ye may repente  of wedded mannes lyf
In which ye seyn  ther is no wo ne stryf
And elles god forbede  but he sente
A wedded man  hym grace to repente
Wel ofte  rather than a sengle man
And therfore sire  the beste reed I kan
  
Dispeire yow noght but haue in youre memorie
Paraunter  she may be youre purgatorie
She may be goddes meene  and goddes whippe
Thanne shal youre soule  vp to heuene skippe
Swifter than dooth an Arwe  out of the bowe
I hope to god  herafter shul ye knowe
That ther nys  no so greet felicitee
In mariage  ne neuere mo shal bee
That yow shal lette  of youre sauacion
So that ye vse  as skile is and reson
The lustes of youre wyf attemprely
And þat ye plese hire nat to amorously
And þat ye kepe yow eek from oother synne
My tale is doon  for my wit is thynne
Beth nat agast herof  my brother deere
But lat vs waden  out of this mateere
The wyf of Bathe  if ye han vnderstonde
Of mariage  which ye haue on honde
Declared hath ful wel  in litel space  
ffareth now wel  god haue yow in his grace
And with this word  this Iustyn and his brother
Han take hir leue  and ech of hem of oother
ffor whan they saughe that it moste be
They wroghten so  by sly and wys tretee
That she this mayden  which þat Mayus highte
As hastily  as euere that she myghte
Shal wedded be  vnto this Ianuarie
I trowe it were to longe yow to tarie
If I yow tolde  of euery scrit and bond
By which  þat she was feffed in his lond
Or for to herknen  of hir riche array
But finally  ycomen is the day
That to the chirche  bothe be they went
ffor to receyue the hooly sacrement
fforth comth the preest with stole aboute his nekke
And bad hire be lyk to Sarra and Rebekke
  
In wysdom and in trouthe of mariage
And seyde hir orisons  as is vsage
And croucheth hem  and bad god sholde hem blesse
And made al siker ynogh  with hoolynesse
 Thus been they wedded  with solempnitee
And at the feeste  sitteth he and she
With othere worthy folk vp on the deys
Al ful of ioye and blisse is the paleys
And ful of Instrumentz  and of vitaille
The moste deynteuous  of all Ytaille
Biforn hem  stooden Instrumentz of swich soun
That Orpheus  ne of Thebes Amphioun
Ne maden neuere  swich a melodye
 At euery cours  thanne cam loud Mynstralcye
That neuere tromped Ioab  for to heere
Nor he Theodomas  yet half so cleere
At Thebes  whan the Citee was in doute
Bacus  the wyn hem skynketh al aboute
And Venus  laugheth vpon euery wight
ffor Ianuarie  was bicome hir knyght
And wolde bothe  assayen his corage
In libertee  and eek in mariage
And with hire fyrbrond  in hire hand aboute
Daunceth  biforn the bryde and al the route
And certeinly  I dar right wel seyn this
Ymeneus  that god of weddyng is
Saugh neuere his lyf so myrie a wedded man
Hoold thou thy pees  thou poete Marcian
That writest vs  that ilke weddyng murie
Of hire Philologie  and hym Mercurie
And of the songes  that the Muses songe  
To smal is bothe thy penne  and eek thy tonge
ffor to descryuen  of this mariage
Whan tendre youthe  hath wedded stoupyng age
Ther is swich myrthe  þat it may nat be writen
Assayeth it youre self  thanne may ye witen
  
If that I lye or noon  in this matiere
 Mayus that sit  with so benyngne a chiere
Hire to biholde  it semed fairye
Queene Ester  looked neuere with swich an eye
On Assuer  so meke a look hath she
I may yow nat deuyse  al hir beautee
But thus muche of hire beautee telle I may
That she was lyk the brighte morwe of May
ffulfild  of alle beautee and plesance
 This Ianuarie  is rauysshed in a trance
At euery tyme  he looked on hir face
But in his herte  he gan hire to manace
That he that nyght in Armes wolde hire streyne
Harder  than euere Parys dide Eleyne
But nathelees  yet hadde he greet pitee
That thilke nyght offenden hire moste he
And thoughte allas  o tendre creature
Now wolde god  ye myghte wel endure
Al my corage  it is so sharpe and keene
I am agast ye shul it nat susteene
But god forbede  þat I dide al my myght
Now wolde god  þat it were woxen nyght
And that the nyght wolde lasten eueremo
I wolde  that al this peple were ago
And finally  he dooth al his labour
As he best myghte  sauynge his honour
To haste hem fro the mete  in subtil wyse
 The tyme cam  that reson was to ryse
And after that men daunce and drynken faste
And spices  al aboute the hous they caste
And ful of ioye and blisse is euery man
All but a Squyer  highte Damyan
Which carf biforn the knyght ful many a day
He was so rauysshed  on his lady May
That for the verray peyne  he was ny wood
Almoost he swelte  and swowned ther he stood
  
So soore  hath Venus hurt hym with hire brond
As þat she bar it daunsynge in hire hond
And to his bed  he wente hym hastily
Namoore of hym  at this tyme speke 
But there I lete hym wepe ynogh and pleyne
Til fresshe May  wol rewen on his peyne
Operilous fyr  that in the bedstraw bredeth  
O famulier foo  that his seruyce bedeth
O seruant traytour  false hoomly hewe
Lyk to the naddre  in bosom sly vntrewe
God shilde vs alle  from youre aqueyntance
O Ianuarie  dronken in plesance
In mariage  se how thy Damyan
Thyn owene squier  and thy born man
Entendeth  for to do thee vileynye
God graunte thee  thyn hoomly fo tespye
ffor in this world  nys worse pestilence
Than hoomly foo  al day in thy presence
 Parfourned hath the sonne  his Ark diurne
No lenger  may the body of hym soiurne
On thorisonte  as in that latitude
Night with his Mantel þat is derk and rude
Gan ouersprede the Hemysperie aboute
ffor which  departed is  this lusty route
ffro Ianuarie  with thank on euery syde
Hoom to hir hous  Iustily they ryde
Where as they doon hir thynges  as hem leste
And whan they sye hir tyne  goon to reste
Soone after that this hastif Ianuarie
Wolde go to bedde  he wolde no lenger tarye
He drynketh Ypocras  Clarree and Vernage
Of spices hoote  tencreessen his corage
And many a letuarie  hath he ful fyn
Swiche as the Monk daun Constantyn
Hath writen  in his book de coitu
To eten hem alle  he nas no thyng eschu
  
And to hise priuee freendes  thus seyde he
ffor goddes loue  as soone as it may be
Lat voyden al this hous  in curteys wyse
And they han doon  right as he wol deuyse
Men drynken  and the trauers drawe anon
The bryde  was broght a bedde  as stille as stoon
And whan the bed  was with the preest yblessed
Out of the chambre  hath euery wight hym dressed
And Ianuarie  hath faste in Armes take
His fresshe May  his Paradys his make
He lulleth hire  he kisseth hire ful ofte
With thilke brustles  of his berd vnsofte
Lyk to the skyn of houndfyssh  sharpe as brere
ffor he was shaue al newe  in his manere
He rubbeth hire  aboute hir tendre face
And seyde thus  allas I moot trespace
To yow my spouse  and yow greetly offende
Er tyme come  þat I wil doun descende
But nathelees  considereth this quod he  
Ther nys no werkman  what so euere he be
That may bothe  werke wel and hastily
This wol be doon at leyser parfitly
It is no fors  how longe þat we pleye
In trewe wedlok  wedded be we tweye
And blessed be the yok þat we been Inne
ffor in  Actes  we mowe do no synne
A man  may do no synne with his wyf
Ne hurte hym seluen  with his owene knyf
ffor we han leue  to pleye vs by the lawe
Thus laboureth he  til þat the day gan dawe
And thanne he taketh a sope  in fyne clarree
And vpright in his bed  thanne sitteth he
And after that he sang ful loude and cleere
And kiste his wyf  and made wantowne cheere
He was al coltissh  ful of ragerye
And ful of Iargon  as a flekked pye
  
The slakke skyn  aboute his nekke shaketh
Whil þat he sang  so chaunteth he and craketh
But god woot what þat May thoughte in hir herte
Whan she hym saugh  vp sittynge in his sherte
In his nyght cappe  and with his nekke lene
She preyseth nat his pleyyng worth a bene
Thanne seide he thus  my reste wol I take
Now day is come  I may no lenger wake
And doun he leyde his heed  and sleepe til pryme
And afterward  whan þat he saugh his tyme
Vp ryseth Ianuarie  but fresshe May
Heeld hire chambre  vnto the fourthe day
As vsage is  of wyues  for the beste
ffor euery labour som tyme moot han reste
Or elles  longe may he nat endure
This is to seyn  no lyues creature
Be it of fyssh  or bryd  or beest or man
Now wol I speke  of woful Damyan
That langwissheth for loue  as ye shul heere
Therfore  I speke to hym in this manere
 I seye  o sely Damyan allas
Andswere to my demaunde  as in this cas
How shaltow  to thy lady fresshe May
Telle thy wo  she wole alwey seye nay
Eek if thou speke  she wol thy wo biwreye
God be thyn helpe  I kan no bettre seye
 This sike Damyan  in Venus fyr
So brenneth  that he dyeth for desyr
ffor which  he putte his lyf in auenture
No lenger myghte he  in this wise endure
But priuely  a penner gan he borwe  
And in a lettre  wroot he al his sorwe
In manere of a compleynt or a lay
Vnto his faire  fresshe lady May
And in a purs of sylk heng on his sherte
He hath it put and leyde it at his herte
  
The moone  that at Noon was thilke day
That Ianuarie  hath wedded fresshe May
In two of Tawr  was in to Cancre glyden
So longe hath Mayus  in hir chambre byden
As custume is  vnto thise nobles alle
A bryde  shal nat eten in the halle
Til dayes foure  or iij dayes atte leeste
Ypassed been  thanne lat hire go to feeste
The fourthe day compleet fro Noon to Noon
Whan þat the heighe masse was ydoon
In halle  sit this Ianuarie and May
As fressh  as is the brighte someres day
And so bifel  how that this goode man
Remembred hym  vpon this Damyan
And seyde  Seynte Marie  how may this be
That Damyan  entendeth nat to me
Is he ay syk  or how may this bityde
Hise squieres  whiche that stooden ther bisyde
Excused hym  by cause of his siknesse
Which letted hym  to doon his bisynesse
Noon oother cause  myghte make hym tarye
 That me forthynketh  quod this Ianuarie
He is a gentil squier  by my trouthe
If that he deyde  it were harm and routhe
He is as wys  discreet and as secree
As any man  I woot of his degree
And therto manly  and eek seruysable
And for to been a thrifty man right able
But after mete  as soone as euere I may
I wol my self visite hym and eek May
To doon hym  al the confort that I kan
And for that word  hym blessed euery man
That of his bountee  and his gentillesse
He wolde so conforten in siknesse
His squier  for it was a gentil dede
Dame quod this Ianuarie  taak good hede
  
At after Noon  ye with youre wommen alle
Whan ye han been in chambre  out of this halle
That alle ye  go se this Damyan
Dooth hym disport he is a gentil man
And telleth hym  that I wol hym visite
Haue I no thyng but rested me a lite
And spede yow faste  for I wole abyde  
Til that ye slepe  faste by my syde
And with that word  he gan to hym to calle
A Squier  that was Marchal of his halle
And tolde hym certeyn thynges  what he wolde
 This fresshe May  hath streight hir wey yholde
With alle hir wommen  vnto Damyan
Doun by his beddes syde  sit she than
Confortynge hym  as goodly as she may
This Damyan  whan that his tyme he say
In secree wise  his purs and eek his bille
In which þat he  ywriten hadde his wille
Hath put in to hire hand  withouten moore
Saue þat he siketh  wonder depe and soore
And softely to hire  right thus seyde he
Mercy  and that ye nat discouere me
ffor I am deed  if that this thyng be kyd
This purs hath she  inwith hir bosom hyd
And wente hire wey  ye gete namoore of me
But vnto Ianuarie  ycomen is she
That on his beddes syde  sit ful softe
He taketh hire  and kisseth hire ful ofte
And leyde hym doun to slepe  and that anon
She feyned hire  as that she moste gon
Ther as ye woot þat euery wight moot neede
And whan she of this bille  hath taken heede
She rente it al to cloutes atte laste
And in the pryuee  softely it caste
Who studieth now  but faire fresshe May
Adoun  by olde Ianuarie she lay
  
That sleepe  til þat the coughe  hath hym awaked
Anon he preyde hire  strepen hire al naked
He wolde of hire he seyde  han som plesance
And seyde  hir clothes  dide hym encombrance
And she obeyeth  be hire lief or looth
But lest ye precious folk  be with me wrooth
How that he wroghte  I dar nat to yow telle
Or wheither  þat hire thoughte it Paradys or helle
But heere I lete hem  werken in hir wyse
Til euensong rong and þat they moste aryse
Were it by destynee  or by auenture
Were it by Influence  or by nature
Or constellacion  that in swich estaat
The heuene  stood that tyme fortunaat
Was for to putte a bille  of Venus werkes
ffor alle thyng hath tyme  as seyn thise clerkes
To any womman  for to gete hire loue
I kan nat seye  but grete god aboue
That knoweth  that noon Act is causelees  
He deme of al  for I wole holde my pees
But sooth is this  how that this fresshe May
Hath take  swich impression that day
ffor pitee  of this sike Damyan
That from hire herte  she ne dryue kan
The remembrance  for to doon hym ese
Certeyn thoghte she  whom þat this thyng displese
I rekke noght  for heere I hym assure
To loue hym best of any creature
Though he namoore hadde than his sherte
Lo pitee  renneth soone in gentil herte
 Heere may ye se  how excellent franchise
In wommen is  whan they hem narwe auyse
Som tyrant is  as ther be many oon
That hath an herte  as hard  as any stoon
Which wolde  han lat hym storuen in the place
Wel rather  than han graunted hym hire grace
  
And hem reioysen  in hire crueel pryde
And rekke nat to been an homycide
 This gentil May  fulfilled of pitee
Right of hire hand  a lettre made she
In which she graunteth hym hire verray grace
Ther lakketh noght oonly  but day and place
Wher þat she myghte  vnto his lust suffise
ffor it shal be  right as he wole deuyse
And whan she saught hir tyme vp on a day
To visite this Damyan  gooth May
And sotilly this lettre  doun she threste
Vnder his pilwe  rede it if hym leste
She taketh hym by the hand  and harde hym twiste
So secrely  that no wight of it wiste
And bad hym been al hool  and forth he wente
To Ianuarie  whan þat he for hym sente
Vp riseth Damyan  the nexte morwe
Al passed was  his siknesse and his sorwe
He kembeth hym  he preyneth hym and pyketh
He dooth  al that his lady lust and lyketh
And eek to Ianuarie  he gooth as lowe
As euere dide  a dogge for the bowe
He is so plesant vnto euery man
ffor craft is al  who so that do it kan
That euery wight is fayn to speke hym good
And fully  in his lady grace he stood
Thus lete I Damyan  aboute his nede
And in my tale  forth I wol procede
 Somme clerkes  holden that felicitee
Stant in delit and therfore certeyn he
This noble Ianuarie  with al his myght  
In honeste wyse  as longeth to a knyght
Shoope hym to lyue  ful deliciously
His housynge  his array  as honestly
To his degree  was maked as a kynges
Amonges othere  of hise honeste thynges
  
He made a gardyn  walled al with stoon
So fair a gardyn  woot I nowher noon
ffor out of doute  I verraily suppose
That he  þat wroot the romance of the Rose
Ne koude of it the beautee wel deuyse
Ne Priapus  ne myghte nat suffise
Though he be god of gardyns  for to telle
The beautee of the gardyn  and the welle
That stood vnder a laurer  alwey grene
fful ofte tyme  he Pluto and his queene
Proserpina  and al hire fairye
Disporten hem  and maken melodye
Aboute that welle  and daunced as men tolde
 This noble knyght this Ianuarie the olde
Swich deyntee hath  in it to walke and pleye
That he wol no wight suffren bere the keye
Saue he hym self for of the smale wyket
He baar alwey  of siluer a Clyket
With which  whan þat hym leste he it vnshette
And whan he wolde  paye his wyf hir dette
In Somer seson  thider wolde he go
And May his wyf and no wight but they two
And thynges  whiche þat were nat doon a bedde
He in the gardyn  parfourned hem and spedde
And in this wyse  many a murye day
Lyued this Ianuarie  and fresshe May
But worldly Ioye  may nat alwey dure
To Ianuarie  ne to no creature
Osodeyn hape  o thou fortune Instable
Lyk to the Scorpion  so deceyuable
That flaterest with thyn heed  whan thou wolt synge
Thy tayl is deeth  thurgh thyn enuenymynge
O brotil Ioye  o sweete venym queynte
O Monstre  that so subtilly kanst peynte
Thy yiftes  vnder hewe of stidefastnesse
That thou deceyuest bothe moore and lesse
  
Why hastow Ianuarie  thus deceyued
That haddest hym  for thy ful freend receyued
And now thou hast biraft hym bothe hise eyen
ffor sorwe of which  desireth he to dyen
 Allas  this noble Ianuarie free
Amydde his lust and his prosperitee
Is woxen blynd  and that al sodeynly  
He wepeth and he wayleth pitously
And ther with al  the fyr of Ialousie
Lest þat his wyf sholde falle in swich folye
So brente his herte  that he wolde fayn
That som man  bothe hym and hire had slayn
ffor neither after his deeth  nor in his lyf
Ne wolde he  þat she were loue ne wyf
But euere lyue as wydwe in clothes blake
Soul as the turtle  þat lost hath hire make
But atte laste  after a Monthe or tweye
His sorwe gan aswage  sooth to seye
ffor whan he wiste  it may noon oother be
He paciently  took his Aduersitee
Saue out of doute  he may nat forgoon
That he nas Ialous  eueremoore in oon
Which Ialousye  it was so outrageous
That neither in halle  nyn noon oother hous
Nyn noon oother place  neuerthemo
He nolde suffre hire  for to ryde or go
But if þat he  had hond on hire alway
ffor which ful ofte  wepeth fresshe May
That loueth Damyan  so benyngnely
That she moot outher dyen sodeynly
Or elles  she moot han hym as hir leste
She wayteth  whan hir herte wolde breste
 Vp on that oother syde Damyan
Bicomen is  the sorwefulleste man
That euere was  for neither nyght ne day
Ne myghte he speke a word to fresshe May
  
As to his purpos  of no swich mateere
But if that Ianuarie  moste it heere
That hadde an hand  vp on hire eueremo
But nathelees  by writyng to and fro
And priuee signes  wiste he what she mente
And she knew eek  the fyn of his entente
O Ianuarie  what myghte it thee auaille
Thogh thou myghtest se  as fer as shippes saille
ffor as good is  blynd deceyued be
As to be deceyued  whan a man may se
 Lo Argus  which þat hadde  an hondred eyen
ffor al þat euere  he koude poure or pryen
Yet was he blent and god woot so been mo
That wenen wisly  that it be nat so
Passe ouer is an ese  I sey namoore
 This fresshe May  þat I spak of so yoore
In warm wex  hath emprented the clyket
That Ianuarie bar  of the smale wyket
By which  in to his gardyn ofte he wente  
And Damyan  that knew al hire entente
The cliket countrefeted pryuely
Ther nys namoore to seye  but hastily
Som wonder  by this clyket shal bityde
Which ye shul heeren  if ye wole abyde
 O noble Ouyde  ful sooth seystou god woot
What sleighte is it thogh it be long and hoot
That he nyl fynde it out  in som manere
By Piramus  and Tesbee  may men leere
Thogh they were kept ful longe streite oueral
They been accorded  rownynge thurgh a wal
Ther no wight  koude han founde out swich a sleighte
 But now to purpos  er þat dayes eighte
Were passed  er the Monthe of Iuyl bifille
That Ianuarie  hath caught so greet a wille
Thurgh eggyng of his wyf hym for to pleye
In his gardyn  and no wight but they tweye
  
That in a morwe  vnto this May seith he
Rys vp my wyf my loue  my lady free
The turtle voys is herd  my dowue sweete
The wynter is goon  with his reynes weete
Com forth now  with thyne eyen columbyn
How fairer been thy brestes  than is wyn
The gardyn  is enclosed al aboute
Com forth my white spouse  out of doute
Thou hast me wounded  in myn herte  o wyf
No spot of thee  ne knew I al my lyf
Come forth  and lat vs taken som disport
I chees thee  for my wyf and my confort
 Swiche olde lewed wordes vsed he
On Damyan  a signe made she
That he sholde go biforn  with his cliket
This Damyan thanne  hath opened the wyket
And In he stirte  and that in swich manere
That no wight myghte it se  neither yheere
And stille he sit vnder a bussh anon
 This Ianuarie  as blynd as is a stoon
With Mayus in his hand  and no wight mo
In to his fresshe gardyn is ago
And clapte to  the wyket sodeynly
 Now wyf quod he  heere nys but thou and I
That art the creature  that I best loue
ffor by that lord  þat sit in heuene aboue
Leuere ich hadde  to dyen on a knyf
Than thee offende  trewe deere wyf
ffor goddes sake  thenk how I thee chees
Noght for no coueitise doutelees
But oonly  for the loue  I had to thee  
And though þat I be oold  and may nat see
Beth to me trewe  and I shal telle yow why
Thre thynges  certes  shal ye wynne ther by
ffirst loue of Crist and to youre self honour
And al myn heritage  toun and tour
  
I yeue it yow  maketh chartres as yow leste
This shal be doon tomorwe er sonne reste
So wisly  god my soule brynge in blisse
I prey yow first in couenat ye me kisse
And though þat I be Ialous wyte me noght
Ye been so depe  enprented in my thoght
That whan I considere youre beautee
And ther with al  the vnlikly elde of me
I may nat certes  though I sholde dye
fforbere  to been out of youre compaignye
ffor verray loue  this is with outen doute
Now kys me wyf and lat vs rome aboute
 This fresshe May  whan she thise wordes herde
Benyngnely  to Ianuarie answerde
But first and forward  she bigan to wepe
I haue quod she  a soule for to kepe
As wel as ye  and also myn honour
And of my wyfhod  thilke tendre flour
Which þat I haue  assured in youre hond
Whan þat the preest to yow my body bond
Wherfore  I wole answere  in this manere
By the leue of yow  my lord so deere
I prey to god  þat neuere dawe the day
That I ne sterue  as foule as womman may
If euere I do  vn to my kyn that shame
Or elles  I empeyre so my name
That I be fals  and if I do that lakke
Do strepe me  and put me in a sakke
And in the nexte ryuer  do me drenche
I am a gentil womman and no wenche
Why speke ye thus  but men been euere vntrewe
And wommen  haue repreue of yow ay newe
Ye han noon oother contenance I leeue
But speke to vs  of vntrust and repreeue
 And with that word  she saugh wher Damyan
Sat in the bussh  and coughen she bigan
  
And with hir fynger  signes made she
That Damyan  sholde clymbe vp on a tree
That charged was with fruyt and vp he wente
ffor verraily  he knew al hire entente
And euery signe  þat she koude make
Wel bet than Ianuarie  hir owene make
ffor in a lettre  she hadde toold hym al  
Of this matere  how he werchen shal
And thus I lete hym sitte  vp on the pyrie
And Ianuarie and May romynge myrie
Bright was the day  and blew the firmament
Phebus hath of gold  hise stremes doun ysent
To gladen euery flour with his warmnesse
He was that tyme  in Geminis as I gesse
But litel  fro his declynacion
Of Cancer  Iouis exaltacion
And so bifel  that brighte morwe tyde
That in that gardyn  in the ferther syde
Pluto  that is kyng of ffairye
And many a lady  in his compaignye
ffolwynge his wyf  the queene Proserpyne
Ech after oother  right as a lyne
Whil þat she gadered  floures in the mede
In Claudyan  ye may the stories rede
And in his grisely Carte  he hire sette
This kyng of ffairye  thanne adoun hym sette
Vp on a bench of turues  fressh and grene
And right anon  thus seyde he to his queene
 My wyf quod he  ther may no wight seye nay
Thexperience  so preueth euery day
The tresons  whiche þat wommen doon to man
Ten hondred thousand  tellen I kan
Notable  of youre vntrouthe and brotilnesse
O Salomon  wys  and richest of richesse
ffulfild of sapience  and of worldly glorie
fful worthy been thy wordes to memorie
  
To euery wight þat wit and reson kan
Thus preiseth he yet the bountee of man
 Amonges a thousand men  yet foond I oon
But of wommen alle  foond I noon
 Thus seith the kyng þat knoweth youre wikkednesse
And Ihesus filius Syrak as I gesse
Ne speketh of yow  but seelde reuerence
A wylde fyr  and corrupt pestilence
So falle vp on youre bodyes yet to nyght
Ne se ye nat this honurable knyght
By cause allas  that he is blynd and old
His owene man  shal make hym Cokewold
Lo heere he sit the lechour in the tree
Now wol I graunten  of my magestee
Vnto this olde blynde worthy knyght
That he shal haue ayeyn hise eyen syght
Whan þat his wyf wold doon hym vileynye
Thanne shal he knowen  al hire harlotrye
Bothe in repreue of hire  and othere mo  
 Ye shal quod Proserpyne  wol ye so
Now by my moodres sires soule I swere
That I shal yeuen hire suffisant answere
And alle wommen after  for hir sake
That though they be  in any gilt ytake
With face boold  they shulle hem self excuse
And bere hem doun  that wolden hem accuse
ffor lakke of answere  noon of hem shal dyen
Al hadde man seyn a thyng with bothe hise eyen
Yit shul we wommen  visage it hardily
And wepe  and swere  and visage it subtilly
So þat ye men  shul been  as lewed as gees
What rekketh me  of youre Auctoritees
 I woot wel  that this Iew  this Salomon
ffoond of vs wommen  fooles many oon
But though þat he ne foond  no good womman
Yet hath ther founde  many another man
  
Wommen ful trewe  ful goode  and vertuous
Witnesse on hem  þat dwelle in Cristes hous
With martirdom  they preued hire constance
The Romayn geestes  eek maken remembrance
Of many a verray  trewe wyf also
But sire ne be nat wrooth  al be it so
Though þat he seyde  he foond no good womman
I prey yow  take the sentence of the man
He mente thus  that in souereyn bontee
Nis noon  but god þat sit in Trinitee
 Ey for verray god  that nys but oon
What make ye  so muche of Salomon
What though he made a temple goddes hous
What though he were  riche and glorious
So made he eek  a temple of false goddis
How myghte he do a thyng þat moore forbode is
Pardee  as faire  as ye his name emplastre
He was a lecchour  and an ydolastre
And in his elde  he verray god forsook
And if god ne hadde  as seith the book
Yspared for his fadres sake  he sholde
Haue lost his regne  rather than he wolde
I sette right noght of al the vileynye
That ye of wommen write  a Boterflye
I am a womman  nedes moot I speke
Or elles swelle  til myn herte breke
ffor sithen he seyde  that we been Iangleress
As euere hool  I moote brouke my tresses
I shal nat spare  for no curteisye
To speke hym harm  þat wolde vs vileynye
Dame quod this Pluto  be no lenger wrooth  
I yeue it vp  but sith I swoor myn ooth
That I wolde  graunten hym his sighte ageyn
My word shal stonde  I warne yow certeyn
I am a kyng it sit me noght to lye
 And I quod she  a Queene of ffairye
  
Hir answere shal she haue I vndertake
Lat vs namoore wordes heerof make
ffor sothe  I wol no lenger yow contrarie
 Now lat vs  turne agayn to Ianuarie
That in the gardyn  with his faire May
Syngeth ful murier  than the Papeiay
Yow loue I best and shal and oother noon
So longe  aboute the Aleyes is he goon
Til he was come  agayns thilke pyrie
Where as this Damyan  sitteth ful myrie
Anheigh  among the fresshe leues grene
 This fresshe May  that is so bright and sheene
Gan for to syke  and seyde  allas my syde
Now sire quod she  for aught þat may bityde
I moste han  of the peres that I see
Or I moot dye  so soore longeth me
To eten  of the smale peres grene
Help for hir loue  þat is of heuene queene
I telle yow wel  a womman in my plit
May han to fruyt so greet an Appetit
That she may dyen  but she of it haue
 Allas quod he  þat I ne had heer a knaue
That koude clymbe  allas allas quod he
That I am blynd  ye sire no fors quod she
 But wolde ye vouche sauf for goddes sake
The pyrie  inwith youre armes for to take
ffor wel I woot that ye mystruste me
Thanne sholde I clymbe  wel ynogh quod she
So I my foot myghte sette vpon youre bak
 Certes quod he  theron shal be no lak
Mighte I yow helpen  with myn herte blood
He stoupeth doun  and on his bak she stood
And caughte hire by a twiste  and vp she gooth
Ladyes  I prey yow  þat ye be nat wrooth
I kan nat glose  I am a rude man
And sodeynly  anon this Damyan
  
Gan pullen vp the smok  and In he throng
 And whan þat Pluto  saugh this grete wrong
To Ianuarie  he gaf agayn his sighte
And made hym se  as wel as euere he myghte
And whan þat he  hadde caught his sighte agayn
Ne was ther neuere  man of thyng so fayn
But on his wyf his thoght was eueremo  
Vp to the tree  he caste hise eyen two
And saugh þat Damyan  his wyf had dressed
In swich manere  it may nat been expressed
But if I wolde  speke vncurteisly
And vp he yaf  a roryng and a cry
As dooth the mooder  whan the child shal dye
Out helpe  allas  harrow he gan to crye
O stronge lady stoore  what dostow
 And she answerde  sire what eyleth yow
Haue pacience  and reson in youre mynde
I haue yow holpe  on bothe youre eyen blynde
Vp peril of my soule  I shal nat lyen
As me was taught  to heele with youre eyen
Was no thyng bet to make yow to see
Than strugle with a man  vp on a tree
God woot I dide it  in ful good entente
 Strugle quod he ye algate In it wente
God yeue yow bothe  on shames deth to dyen
He swyued thee  I saugh it with myne eyen
And elles  be I hanged by the hals
 Thanne is quod she  my medicyne fals
ffor certeinly  if that ye myghte se
Ye wolde nat seyn  thise wordes vn to me
Ye han som glymsyng and no parfit sighte
 I se quod he  as wel as euere I myghte
Thonked be god  with bothe myne eyen two
And by my trouthe  me thoughte he dide thee so
 Ye maze  maze  goode sire quod she
This thank haue I  for I haue maad yow see
  
Allas quod she  that euere I was so kynde
 Now dame quod he  lat al passe out of mynde
Com doun my lief and if I haue myssayd
God helpe me so  as I am yuele apayd
But by my fader soule  I wende han seyn
How that this Damyan  hadde by thee leyn
And þat thy smok hadde leyn vp on his brest
 Ye sire quod she  ye may wene as yow lest
But sire  a man  þat waketh out of his sleepe
He may nat sodeynly  wel taken keepe
Vp on a thyng ne seen it parfitly
Til þat he be  adawed verraily
 Right so a man  þat longe hath blynd ybe
Ne may nat sodeynly  so wel yse
ffirst whan his sighte  is newe come ageyn
As he þat hath  a day or two yseyn
Til that youre sighte  ysatled be a while
Ther may  ful many a sighte yow bigile
Beth war I prey yow  for by heuene kyng  
fful many a man  weneth to seen a thyng
And it is  al another  than it semeth
He þat mysconceyueth  he mysdemeth
And with that word  she leepe doun fro the tree
 This Ianuarie  who is glad but he
He kisseth hire  and clippeth hire ful ofte
And on hire wombe  he stroketh hire ful softe
And to his palays  hoom he hath hire lad
Now goode men  I pray yow be glad
Thus endeth heere  my tale of Ianuarie
God blesse vs  and his mooder Seinte Marie
Ey goddes mercy  seyde oure Hoost tho
Now swich a wyf I pray god kepe me fro
Lo whiche sleightes  and subtiltees
In wommen been  for ay as bisy as bees
Been they  vs sely men for to deceyue
And from a sooth  euere wol they weyue
By this Marchauntes tale  it preueth weel
But doutelees  as trewe as any steel
I haue a wyf though þat she poure be
But of hir tonge  a labbyng shrewe is she
And yet she hath  an heepe of vices mo
Therof no fors  lat alle swiche thynges go
But wyte ye what in conseil be it seyd
Me reweth soore  I am vnto hire teyd
ffor and I sholde  rekenen euery vice
Which þat she hath  ywis I were to nyce
And cause why  it sholde reported be
And toold to hire  of somme of this meynee
Of whom  it nedeth nat for to declare
Syn wommen  konnen outen swich chaffare
And eek my wit suffiseth nat ther to
To tellen al  wherfore my tale is do  
 Squier come neer  if it youre wille be
And sey somwhat of loue  for certes ye
Konnen ther on  as muche as any man
 Nay sire quod he  but I wol seye as I kan
With hertly wyl  for I wol nat rebelle
Agayn youre lust a tale wol I telle
Haue me excused  if I speke amys  
My wyl is good  and lo my tale is this

AT Sarray  in the land of Tartarye
Ther dwelte a kyng that werreyed Russye
Thurgh which ther dyde  many a doughty man
This noble kyng was cleped Cambynskan
Which in his tyme  was of so greet renoun
That ther was  no wher in no Regioun
So excellent a lord  in alle thyng
Hym lakked noght that longeth to a kyng
And of the secte  of which þat he was born
He kepte his lay  to which þat he was sworn
And ther to  he was hardy  wys and riche
And pitous and Iust alwey yliche
Sooth of his word  benigne and honurable
Of his corage  as any Centre stable
Yong fressh  strong and in Armes desirous
As any Bacheler  of al his hous
A fair persone he was  and fortunat
And kepte alwey  so wel roial estat
That ther was nowher  swich another man
 This noble kyng this Tartre Cambynskan
Hadde two sones  on Elpheta his wyf
Of whiche  the eldeste highte Algarsyf
That oother sone  was cleped Cambalo
A doghter hadde  this worthy kyng also
That yongest was  and highte Canacee
But for to telle yow  al hir beautee
It lyth nat in my tonge  nyn my konnyng
I dar nat vndertake  so heigh a thyng
  
Myn englissh eek is insufficient
I moste been  a Rethor excellent
That koude hise colours  longynge for that Art
If he  sholde hire discryuen euery part
I am noon swich  I moot speke as I kan
 And so bifel  that whan this Cambynskan
Hath twenty wynter  born his diademe
As he was wont fro yeer to yeer I deme
He leet the feeste  of his Natiuitee
Doon cryen  thurgh Sarray his Citee
The last Idus of March  after the yeer
Phebus the sonne  ful ioly was and cleer
ffor he was  neigh his exaltacion
In Martes face  and in his mansion
In Aries  the colerik hoote signe  
fful lusty was  the weder and benigne
ffor which the foweles  agayn the sonne sheene
What for the seson  and the yonge grene
fful loude  songen hire affeccions
Hem semed  han geten hem proteccions
Agayn the swerd of wynter keene and coold
 This Cambynskan  of which I haue yow toold
In roial vestiment sit on his deys
With diademe  ful heighe in his paleys
And halt his feeste so solempne  and so ryche
That in this world  was ther noon it lyche
Of which  if I shal tellen al tharray
Thanne wolde it occupie a someres day
And eek it nedeth nat for to deuyse
At euery cours  the ordre of hire seruyse
I wol nat tellen  of hir strange sewes
Ne of hir swannes  nor of hire heronsewes
Eek in that lond  as tellen knyghtes olde
Ther is som mete  þat is ful deynte holde
That in this lond  men recche of it but smal
Ther nys no man  that may reporten al
  
 I wol nat taryen yow  for it is pryme
And for it is no fruyt but los of tyme
Vn to my firste  I wole haue my recours
 And so bifel  that after the thridde cours
Whil þat this kyng sit thus in his nobleye
Herknynge hise Mynstrals  hir thynges pleye
Biforn hym at the bord  deliciously
In at the halle dore  al sodeynly
Ther cam a knyght vp on a steede of bras
And in his hand  a brood Mirour of glas
Vpon his thombe  he hadde of gold a ryng 
And by his syde  a naked swerd hangyng
And vp he rideth  to the heighe bord
In al the halle  ne was ther spoken a word
ffor merueille of this knyght hym to biholde
fful bisily  ther wayten yonge and olde
 This strange knyght that cam thus sodeynly
Al armed  saue his heed  ful richely
Saleweth kyng and queene  and lordes alle
By ordre  as they seten in the halle
With so heigh reuerence  and obeisance
As wel in speche  as in contenance
That Gawayn  with his olde curteisye
Though he were  comen ayeyn out of ffairye
Ne koude hym nat amende with a word
And after this  biforn the heighe bord
He with a manly voys  seith his message  
After the forme  vsed in his langage
With outen vice  of silable  or of lettre
And for his tale  sholde seme the bettre
Accordant to hise wordes  was his cheere
As techeth art of speche  hem þat it leere
Al be  that I kan nat sowne his stile
Ne kan nat clymben  ouer so heigh a style
Yet seye I this  as to commune entente
Thus muche amounteth  al þat euere he mente
  
If it so be  þat I haue it in mynde
 He seyde  the kyng of Arabe and of Inde
My lige lord  on this solempne day
Saleweth yow  as he best kan and may
And sendeth yow  in honour of youre feeste
By me  that am al redy at youre heeste
This steede of bras  that esily and weel
Kan in the space  of o day natureel
This is to seyn  in foure and twenty houres
Wher so yow lyst in droghte or elles shoures
Beren youre body  in to euery place
To which youre herte  wiIneth for to pace
With outen wem of yow  thurgh foul or fair
Or if yow lyst to fleen  as hye in the Air
As dooth an Egle  whan þat hym list to soore
This same steede  shal bere yow euere moore
With outen harm  til ye be ther yow leste
Though that ye slepen  on his bak or reste
And turne ayeyn  with writhyng of a pyn
He þat it wroghte  koude ful many a gyn
He wayted  many a constellacion
Er he  had doon  this operacion
And knew ful many a seel  and many a bond
 This mirrour eek  þat I haue in myn hond
Hath swich a myght þat men may in it see
Whan ther shal fallen  any Aduersitee
Vn to youre regne  or to youre self also
And openly  who is youre freend or foo
 And ouer al this  if any lady bright
Hath set hire herte  in any maner wight
If he be fals  she shal his treson see
His newe loue  and al his subtiltee
So openly  þat ther shal no thyng hyde
Wherfore  ageyn this lusty someres tyde
This Mirour and this ryng þat ye may see
He hath sent vn to my lady Canacee
  
Youre excellente doghter that is heere
 The vertu of the ryng if ye wol heere
Is this  that if hire lust it for to were  
Vp on hir thombe  or in hir purs it bere
Ther is no fowel  þat fleeth vnder the heuene
That she  ne shal  wel vnderstonde his steuene
And knowe his menyng openly and pleyn
And answere hym  in his langage ageyn
And euery gras  that groweth vp on roote
She shal eek knowe  and whom it wol do boote
Al be hise woundes  neuer so depe and wyde
 This naked swerd  þat hangeth by my syde
Swich vertu hath  þat what man so ye smyte
Thurgh out his Armure  it wole hym kerue and byte
Were it as thikke  as is a branched ook
And what man  that is wounded with a strook
Shal neuer be hool  til þat yow list of grace
To stroke hym with the plat in that place
Ther he is hurt  this is as muche to seyn
Ye moote  with the plat swerd ageyn
Strike hym in the wounde  and it wol close
This is a verray sooth  with outen glose
It failleth nat whils it is in youre hoold
 And whan this knyght hath thus his tale toold
He rideth out of halle  and doun he lighte
His steede  which þat shoon  as sonne brighte
Stant in the court stille as any stoon
This knyght is to his chambre lad anoon
And is vnarmed  and vn to mete yset
 The presentes  been  ful roially yfet
This is to seyn  the swerd and the Mirour
And born anon  in to the heighe Tour
With certeine officers  ordeyned therfore
And vn to Canacee  this ryng was bore
Solempnely  ther she sit at the table
But sikerly  with outen any fable
  
The hors of bras  þat may nat be remewed
It stant as it were  to the ground yglewed
Ther may no man  out of the place it dryue
ffor noon engyn  of wyndas ne polyue
And cause why for they kan nat the craft
And therfore  in the place  they han it laft
Til þat the knyght hath taught hem the manere
To voyden hym  as ye shal after heere
Greet was the prees  þat swarmeth to and fro
To gauren on this hors  that stondeth so
ffor it so heigh was  and so brood and long
So wel proporcioned  for to been strong
Right as it were  a steede of Lumbardye
Therwith so horsly  and so quyk of eye
As it a gentil Poilleys Courser were  
ffor certes  fro his tayl  vn to his ere
Nature ne Art ne koude hym nat amende
In no degree  as al the peple wende
But eueremoore  hir mooste wonder was
How þat it koude go  and was of bras
It was a ffairye  as al the peple semed
Diuerse folk  diuersely they demed
As many heddes  as manye wittes ther been
They murmureden  as dooth a swarm of Been
And maden skiles  after hir fantasies
Rehersynge  of thise olde poetries
And seyde  that it was lyk the Pegasee
The hors  þat hadde wynges for to flee
Or elles  it was the Grekes hors Synon
That broghte Troie to destruccion
As men  in thise olde geestes rede
 Myn herte quod oon  is eueremoore in drede
I trowe  som men of Armes been ther Inne
That shapen hem  this Citee for to wynne
It were right good  þat al swich thyng were knowe
 Another rowned  to his felawe lowe
  
And seyde he lyeth  it is rather lyk
An apparence  ymaad by som Magyk
As Iogelours pleyen  at thise feestes grete
Of sondry doutes  thus they Iangle and trete
As lewed peple  demeth comunly
Of thynges  þat been maad  moore subtilly
Than they kan  in hir lewednesse comprehende
They demen gladly  to the badder ende
 And somme of hem  wondred on the Mirour
That born was vp  in to the hye tour
Hou men myghte in it  swiche thynges se
 Another answerde  and seyde it myghte wel be
Naturelly  by composicions
Of Anglis  and of slye reflexions
And seyden  þat in Rome was swich oon
They speken  of Alocen and Vitulon
And Aristotle  that writen in hir lyues
Of queynte Mirours  and of prospectiues
As knowen they  that han hir bookes herd
 And oother folk han wondred on the swerd
That wolde percen  thurgh out euery thyng
And fille in speche  of Thelophus the kyng
And of Achilles  with his queynte spere
ffor he koude with it bothe heele and dere
Right in swich wise  as men may with the swerd
Of which right now  ye han youre seluen herd
They speken  of sondry hardyng of metal  
And speke of medicynes  ther with al
And how and whanne  it sholde yharded be
Which is vnknowe  algates vnto me
 Tho speeke they  of Canacees ryng
And seyden alle  þat swich a wonder thyng
Of craft of rynges  herde they neuere noon
Saue þat he Moyses  and kyng Salomon
Hadde a name of konnyng in swich Art
Thus seyn the peple  and drawen hem apart
  
 But nathelees  somme seiden þat it was
Wonder to maken  of fern Asshen glas
And yet nys glas  nat lyk Asshen of fern
But for they han  knowen it so fern
Therfore  cesseth  hir Ianglyng and hir wonder
 As soore wondren somme  on cause of thonder
On ebbe  on flood  on gossomer  and on myst
And on alle thyng til þat the cause is wyst
Thus Iangle they  and demen and deuyse
Til þat the kyng gan fro the bord aryse
Phebus  hath laft the Angle meridional
And yet ascendynge  was the beest roial
The gentil leon  with his Aldrian
Whan þat this Tartre kyng Cambynskan
Roos fro his bord  ther that he sat ful hye
Toforn hym gooth  the loude Mynstralcye
Til he cam  to his chambre of parementz
Ther as they sownen  diuerse Instrumentz
That it is  lyk an heuene for to heere
Now dauncen  lusty Venus children deere
ffor in the fyssh  hir lady sat ful hye
And looketh on hem  with a freendly eye
 This noble kyng is set vp in his Trone
This strange knyght is fet to hym ful soone
And on the daunce  he gooth with canacce
Heere is the reuel  and the Iolitee
That is nat able  a dul man to deuyse
He moste han knowen  loue and his seruyse
And been a feestlych man  as fressh as May
That sholde yow  deuysen swich array
 Who koude telle yow  the forme of daunces
So vnkouthe  and so fresshe contenaunces
Swich subtil lookyng and dissymulynges
ffor drede  of Ialouse mennes aperceyuynges
No man but launcelet and he is deed
Therfore I passe  of al this lustiheed
  
I sey namoore  but in this Iolynesse
I lete hem  til men to the soper dresse
 The Styward bit Spices for to hye  
And eek the wyn  in al this melodye
The vsshers  and the squiers been ygoon
The spices and the wyn is come anoon
They ete and drynke  and whan this hadde an ende
Vn to the temple  as reson was they wende
 The seruice doon  they soupen al by day
What nedeth me  rehercen hire array
Ech man woot wel  þat a kynges feeste
Hath plentee  to the mooste and to the leeste
And deyntees  mo  than been in my knowyng
At after soper gooth this noble kyng
To seen this hors of bras  with al the route
Of lordes  and of ladyes hym aboute
 Swich wondryng was ther on this hors of bras
That syn the grete sege  of Troie was
Ther as men wondreden  on an hors also
Ne was ther swich a wondryng as was tho
But fynally  the kyng axeth this knyght
The vertu of this Courser  and the myght
And preyde hym  to telle his gouernaunce
 This hors anoon  bigan to trippe and daunce
Whan that this knyght leyde hand vp on his reyne
And seyde sire  ther is namoore to seyne
But whan yow list to ryden any where
Ye mooten trille a pyn  stant in his ere
Which I shal yow telle  bitwix vs two
Ye moote nempne hym  to what place also
Or to what contree  þat yow list to ryde
And whan ye come  ther as yow list abyde
Bidde hym descende  and trille another pyn
ffor ther lith  theffect of al the gyn
And he wol doun descende  and doon youre wille
And in that place  he wol stonde stille
  
Though al the world  the contrarie hadde yswore
He shal nat thennes  been ydrawe nor ybore
Or if yow list bidde hym thennes goon
Trille this pyn  and he wol vanysshe anoon
Out of the sighte  of euery maner wight
And come agayn  be it day or nyght
Whan þat yow list to clepen hym ageyn
In swich a gyse  as I shal to yow seyn
Bitwixe yow and me  and that ful soone
Ride whan yow list ther is namoore to doone
 Enformed  whan the kyng was of that knyght
And hath conceyued  in his wit aright
The manere  and the forme  of al this thyng
Thus glad and blithe  this noble kyng
Repeireth to his reuel  as biforn  
 The brydel  is  vn to the tour yborn
And kept among hise Iueles  leeue and deere
The hors vanysshed I noot in what manere
Out of hir sighte  ye gete namoore of me
But thus I lete  in lust and Iolitee
This Cambynskan  hise lordes festeiynge
Til wel ny  the day bigan to sprynge
The Norice of digestioun  the sleepe
Gan on hem wynke  and bad hem taken keepe
That muchel drynke  and labour wolde han reste
And with a galpyng mouth  hem alle he keste
And seyde  it was tyme to lye adoun
ffor blood  was in his domynacioun
Cherisseth blood  natures freend quod he
They thanken hym galpynge  by two  by thre
And euery wight  gan drawe hym to his reste
As sleepe hem bad  they tooke it for the beste
  
 Hire dremes  shul nat been ytoold for me
fful were hire heddes  of fumositee
That causeth dreem  of which ther nys no charge
They slepen  til that it was pryme large
The mooste part but it were Canacee
She was ful mesurable  as wommen be
ffor of hir fader  hadde she take leue
To goon to reste  soone after it was eue
Hir liste nat appalled for to be
Ne on the morwe  vnfeestlich for to se
And slepte hire firste sleepe  and thanne awook
ffor swich a ioye  she in hir herte took
Bothe of hir queynte ryng and hire Mirour
That twenty tyme  she changed hir colour
And in hire sleepe  right for impression
Of hire Mirour she hadde Avision
Wherfore  er þat the sonne gan vp glyde
She cleped  on hir Maistresse  hire bisyde
And seyde  that hire liste for to ryse
 Thise olde wommen  þat been gladly wyse
As hire Maistresse  answerde hire anon
And seyde madame  whider wil ye goon
Thus erly  for the folk been alle on reste
 I wol quod she arise  for me leste
No lenger for to slepe  and walke aboute  
 Hire Maistresse  clepeth wommen  a greet route
And vp they rysen  wel an ten  or twelue
Vp riseth  fresshe Canacee  hir selue
As rody and bright  as dooth the yonge sonne
That in the Ram  is foure degrees vp ronne
Noon hyer was he  whan she redy was
And forth she walketh  esily a pas
Arrayed  after the lusty seson soote
Lightly for to pleye  and walke on foote
Nat but with fyue or sixe  of hir meynee
And in a trench  forth in the park gooth she
  
 The vapour  which þat fro the erthe glood
Made the sonne  to seme rody and brood
But nathelees  it was so fair a sighte
That it made  alle hire hertes for to lighte
What for the seson  and the morwenynge
And for the foweles  that she herde synge
ffor right anon  she wiste what they mente
Right by hir song and knew al hire entente
 The knotte  why þat euery tale is toold
If it be taried  til that lust be coold
Of hem þat han  it after herkned yoore
The sauour passeth  euer lenger the moore
ffor fulsomnesse  of his prolixitee
And by the same reson  thynketh me
I sholde  to the knotte  condescende
And maken of hir walkyng soone an ende
Amydde a tree  fordryed  as whit as chalk
As Canacee  was pleyyng in hir walk
Ther sat a ffaucon  ouer hire heed ful hye
That with a pitous voys  so gan to crye
That all the wode  resouned of hire cry
Ybeten hath she hir self  so pitously
With bothe hir wynges  til the rede blood
Ran endelong the tree  ther she stood
And euere in oon  she cryde alwey and shrighte
And with hir beek  hir seluen so she prighte
That ther nys Tygre  ne noon so crueel beest
That dwelleth  outher in wode or in fforest
That nolde han wept if þat she wepe koude
ffor sorwe of hire  she shrighte alwey so loude
ffor ther nas neuere man  yet on lyue
If þat I koude  a ffaucon wel discryue
That herde of swich another of fairnesse
As wel of plumage  as of gentillesse
Of shape  and al that myghte yrekened be
A ffaucon peregryn  thanne semed she
  
Of fremde Land  and eueremoore as she stood  
She swowneth now and now  for lakke of blood
Til wel neigh  is she fallen fro the tree
 This faire kynges doghter Canacee
That on hir fynger baar the queynte ryng
Thurgh which  she vnderstood wel euery thyng
That any fowel  may in his leden seyn
And koude answeren hym  in his ledene ageyn
Hath vnderstonde  what this ffaucon seyde
And wel neigh  for the routhe  almoost she deyde
And to the tree  she gooth ful hastily
And on this ffaukon  looketh pitously
And heeld hir lappe abrood  for wel she wiste
The ffaukon  moste fallen fro the twiste
Whan þat it swowned next for lakke of blood
A longe while  to wayten hire she stood
Til atte laste  she spak in this manere
Vn to the hauk as ye shal after heere
 What is the cause  if it be for to telle
That ye be  in this furial pyne of helle
Quod Canacee  vn to the hauk aboue
Is this for sorwe of deeth  or los of loue
ffor as I trowe  thise been causes two
That causeth moost a gentil herte wo
Of oother harm  it nedeth nat to speke
ffor ye youre self  vpon your self yow wreke
Which proueth wel  that outher loue or drede
Moot been encheson  of youre cruel dede
Syn þat I see  noon oother wight yow chace
ffor loue of god  as dooth youre seluen grace
Or what may been youre helpe  for West nor Est
Ne saugh I neuere er now  no bryd ne beest
That ferde with hym self  so pitously
Ye sle me with youre sorwe verraily
I haue of yow  so greet passioun
ffor goddes loue  com fro the tree adoun
  
And as I am  a kynges doghter trewe
If þat I verraily  the cause knewe
Of youre disese  if it lay in my myght
I wolde amenden it er þat it were nyght
As wisly helpe me  the grete god of kynde
And herbes  shal I right ynowe yfynde
To heele with  youre hurtes hastily
 Tho shrighte this ffaucon  moore yet pitously
Than euer she dide  and fil to grounde anon
And lith aswowne deed  and lyk a stoon
Til Canacee  hath in hire lappe hire take
Vn to the tyme  she gan of swough awake
 And after that she of hir swough gan breyde  
Right in hir haukes ledene  thus she seyde
That pitee  renneth soone in gentil herte
ffeelynge his similitude  in peynes smerte
Is preued al day  as men may see
As wel by werk as by Auctoritee
ffor gentil herte  kitheth gentillesse
I se wel  ye han of my distresse
Compassion  my faire Canacee
Of verray wommanly benignytee
That nature  in youre principles hath yset
But for noon hope  for to fare the bet
But for obeye  vn to youre herte free
And for to maken othere  be war by me
As by the whelpe  chasted is the leon
Right for that cause  and for that conclusion
Whil þat I haue  a leyser and a space
Myn harm  I wol confessen er I pace
 And euere  whil þat oon hir sorwe tolde
That oother weepe  as she to water wolde
Til that the ffaucon  bad hire to be stille
And with a syk  right thus she seyde hir wille
 That I was bred  allas that harde day
And fostred in a Roche  of Marbul gray
  
So tendrely  that no thyng eyled me
I nyste nat what was Aduersitee
Til I koude flee ful hye  vnder the sky
Tho dwelte  a Tercelet me faste by
That semed welle  of alle gentillesse
Al were he ful of treson  and falsnesse
It was so wrapped  vnder humble cheere
And vnder hewe of trouthe  in swich manere
Vnder plesance  and vnder bisy peyne
That I ne koude han wend  he koude feyne
So depe in greyn  he dyed his colours
Right as a serpent hit hym vnder floures
Til he may seen  his tyme  for to byte
Right so this god of loue  this ypocryte
Dooth so hise cerymonyes and obeisances
And kepeth in semblant alle hise obseruances
That sowneth  in to gentillesse of loue
As in a toumbe  is al the faire aboue
And vnder is the corps  swich as ye woot
Swich was the ypocrite  bothe coold and hoot
And in this wise  he serued his entente
That saue the feend  noon wiste what he mente
Til he so longe  hadde wopen and compleyned
And many a yeer  his seruice to me feyned
Til that myn herte  to pitous and to nyce  
Al Innocent of his corouned malice
fforferd of his deeth  as thoughte me
Vpon hise othes  and his seuretee
Graunted hym loue  vp on this condicioun
That eueremoore  myn honour and renoun
Were saued  bothe priuee and apert
This is to seyn  that after his desert
I yaf hym al myn herte  and my thoght
God woot and he  þat ootherwise noght
And took his herte  in chaunge for myn for ay
But sooth is seyd  goon sithen many a day
  
A trewe wight and a theef thenken nat oon
And whan he saugh  the thyng so fer ygoon
That I hadde graunted hym  fully my loue
In swich a gyse  as I haue seyd aboue
And yeuen hym  my trewe herte as free
As he swoor  he yaf his herte to me
Anon this Tigre  ful of doublenesse
ffil on hise knees  with so deuout humblesse
With so heigh reuerence  and as by his cheere
So lyk a gentil louere  of manere
So rauysshed  as it semed for the Ioye
That neuere Troilus  ne Parys of Troye
Iason certes  ne noon oother man
Syn Lameth was  þat alderfirst bigan
To louen two  as writen folk biforn
Ne neuere  syn the firste man was born
Ne koude man  by twenty thousand part
Countrefete  the Sophymes of his Art
Ne were worthy  vnbokelen his galoche
Ther doublenesse  or feynyng sholde approche
Ne so koude thanke a wight  as he dide me
His manere  was an heuene for to see
Til any womman  were she neuer so wys
So peynted he  and kembde at point deuys
As wel hise wordes  as his contenance
And I loued hym  for his obeisance
And for the trouthe  I demed in his herte
That if so were  that any thyng hym smerte
Al were it neuer so lite  and I it wiste
Me thoughte  I felte deeth myn herte twiste
And shortly  so ferforth  this thyng is went
That my wyl  was his willes Instrument
This is to seyn  my wyl obeyed his wyl
In alle thyng as fer as reson fil
Kepynge the boundes  of my worshipe euere
Ne neuere hadde I thyng so lief ne leuere
  
As hym god woot ne neuere shal namo  
This lasteth lenger than a yeer or two
That I supposed of hym  noght but good
But finally  thus atte laste it stood
That ffortune wolde  þat he moste twynne
Out of that place  which þat I was Inne
Wher me was wo  that is no question
I kan nat make of it discripsion
ffor o thyng dare I tellen boldely
I knowe  what is the peyne of deeth ther by
Swich harme I felte  for I ne myghte bileue
So on a day  of me he took his leue
So sorwefully eek that I wende verraily
That he had felt as muche harm as I
Whan þat I herde hym speke  and saugh his hewe
But nathelees  I thoughte  he was so trewe
And eek þat he  repaire sholde ageyn
With Inne a litel while  sooth to seyn
And reson wolde eek that he moste go
ffor his honour  as ofte it happeth so
That I made vertu  of necessitee
And took it wel  syn þat it moste be
As I best myghte  I hidde fro hym my sorwe
And took hym by the hond  seint Iohn to borwe
And seyde hym thus  lo I am youres al
Beth swich  as I to yow  haue been and shal
What he answerde  it nedeth noght reherce
Who kan sey bet than he  who kan do werse
Whan he hath al seyd  thanne hath he doon
Therfore bihoueth hire  a ful long spoon
That shal ete with a feend  thus herde I seye
So atte laste  he moste forth his weye
And forth he fleeth  til he cam ther hym leste
Whan it cam  hym to purpos  for to reste
I trowe  he hadde  thilke text in mynde
That alle thyng repeirynge to his kynde
  
Gladeth hym self thus seyn men as I gesse
Men louen of propre kynde newefangelnesse
As briddes doon  that men in cages fede
ffor though thou nyght and day  take of hem hede
And strawe hir Cage  faire and softe as silk
And yeue hem sugre  hony  breed and Milk
Yet right anon  as that his dore is vppe
He with his feet wol spurne adoun his cuppe
And to the wode he wole and wormes ete
So newefangel  been they of hire mete
And louen nouelrie  of propre kynde
No gentillesse of blood  may hem bynde
 So ferde this Tercelet allas the day  
Though he were gentil born  fressh and gay
And goodlich for to seen  humble and free
He saugh vp on a tyme a kyte flee
And sodeynly  he loued this kyte so
That al his loue  is clene fro me ago
And hath his trouthe  falsed in this wyse
Thus hath the kyte  my loue in hire seruyse
And I am lorn  with outen remedie
And with that word  this ffaucon gan to crie
And swowned eft in Canacees barm
 Greet was the sorwe  for the haukes harm
That Canacee  and alle hir wommen made
They nyste  hou they myghte the ffaucon glade
But Canacee  hom bereth hire in hir lappe
And softely  in plastres gan hire wrappe
Ther as she  with hire beek hadde hurt hir selue
Now kan nat Canacee  but herbes delue
Out of the ground  and make saues newe
Of herbes preciouse  and fyne of hewe
To heelen with this   fro day to nyght
She dooth hire bisynesse  and hire fulle myght
And by hire beddes heed  she made a Mewe
And couered it with veluettes blewe
  
In signe of trouthe  that is in wommen sene
And al with oute the Mewe  is peynted grene
In which ther were ypeynted  alle thise false fowles
As beth thise tidyues  tercelettes and Owles
Right for despit were peynted hem bisyde
And pyes on hem  for to crie and chyde
 Thus lete I Canacee  hir hauk kepyng
I wol namoore as now  speke of hir ryng
Til it come eft to purpos for to seyn
How that this ffaucon  gat hire loue ageyn
Repentant as the storie telleth vs
By mediacion of Cambalus
The kynges sone  of which I yow tolde
But hennes forth  I wol my proces holde
To speken of auentures  and of batailles
That neuere yet was herd  so grete meruailles
 ffirst wol I telle yow  of Cambynskan
That in his tyme  many a Citee wan
And after wol I speke of Algarsif
How that he wan Theodera to his wif
ffor whom ful ofte  in greet peril he was
Ne hadde he be holpen  by the steede of bras
And after  wol I speke of Cambalo
That faught in lystes  with the bretheren two
For Canacee  er that he myghte hire wynne  
An ther I lefte  I wol ayeyn bigynne
Appollo whirleth vp  his Chaar so hye
Til that the god  Mercurius hous the slye
IN feith Squier  thow hast thee wel yquit
And gentilly  I preise wel thy wit
Quod the ffrankeleyn  considerynge thy yowthe
So feelyngly thou spekest sire I allowethe
As to my doom  ther is noon that is heere
Of eloquence  that shal be thy peere
If that thou lyue  god yeue thee good chaunce
And in vertu  sende thee continuaunce
ffor of thy speche  I haue greet deyntee
I haue a sone  and by the Trinitee
I hadde leuere  than twenty pound worth lond
Though it right now  were fallen in myn hond
He were a man  of swich discrecion
As that ye been  fy on possession
But if a man  be vertuous with al
I haue my sone snybbed  and yet shal
ffor he to vertu  listneth nat entende
But for to pleye at dees  and to despende
And lese al that he hath  is his vsage
And he hath leuere  talken with a page
Than to comune  with any gentil wight
There he myghte lerne gentillesse aright
 Straw for youre gentillesse  quod our hoost
What ffrankeleyn  pardee sire wel thou woost
That ech of yow  moot tellen atte leste
A tale or two  or breken his biheste
 That knowe I wel sire  quod the ffrankeleyn
I prey yow  haueth me nat in desdeyn
  
Though to this man I speke 1a word1 or two
 Telle on thy tale  with outen wordes mo
 Gladly sire hoost quod he  I wole obeye
Vn to your wyl  now herkneth what I seye
I wol yow nat contrarien in no wyse
As fer  as that my wittes  wol suffyse
I prey to god  that it may plesen yow
Thanne woot I wel  that it is good ynow
THise olde gentil Britons  in hir dayes
Of diuerse auentures  maden layes
Rymeyed  in hir firste Briton tonge
Whiche layes  with hir Instrumentz they songe
Or elles redden hem  for hir plesance
And oon of hem  haue I in remembrance
Which I shal seyn  with good wyl as I kan
 But sires  by cause I am a burel man
At my bigynnyng first I yow biseche
Haue me excused  of my rude speche
I lerned neuere Rethorik certeyn
Thyng þat I speke  it moot be bare and pleyn
I sleepe neuere  on the Mount of Pernaso
Ne lerned  Marcus Tullius Scithero
Colours ne knowe I none with outen drede
But swiche colours  as growen in the Mede
Or elles swiche  as men dye or peynte
Colours of Rethoryk been to queynte
My spirit feeleth noght of swich mateere
But if yow list my tale shul ye heere
IN Armorik that called is Britayne
Ther was a knyght  þat loued and dide his payne
To serue a lady  in his beste wise
And many a labour  many a greet emprise
  
He for his lady wroghte  er she were wonne
ffor she was  oon the faireste vnder sonne
And eek therto  comen of so heigh kynrede
That wel vnnethes  dorste this knyght for drede
Telle hire his wo  his peyne  and his distresse
But atte laste  she for his worthynesse
And namely  for his meke obeysance
Hath swich a pitee caught of his penance
That pryuely  she fil of his accord
To take hym  for hir housbonde and hir lord
Of swich lordshipe  as men han ouer hir wyues
And for to lede  the moore in blisse hir lyues
Of his free wyl  he swoor hire as a knyght
That neuere in al his lyf he day ne nyght
Ne sholde vp on hym  take no maistrie
Agayn hir wyl  ne kithe hire Ialousie
But hire obeye  and folwe hir wyl in al  
As any louere  to his lady shal
Saue  that the name of soueraynetee
That wolde he haue  for shame of his degree
 She thanked hym  and with ful greet humblesse
She seyde sire  sith of youre gentillesse
Ye profre me  to haue so large a reyne
Ne wolde neuere god  bitwixe vs tweyne
As in my gilt were outher werre or stryf
Sire  I wol be  youre humble trewe wyf
Haue heer my trouthe  til þat myn herte breste
Thus been they  bothe in quiete and in reste
 ffor o thyng sires  saufly dar I seye
That freendes  euerych oother moot obeye
If they wol longe  holden compaignye
Loue  wol nat been constreyned by maistrye
Whan maistrie comth  the god of loue anon
Beteth hise wynges  and farewel he is gon
Loue is a thyng as any Spirit free
Wommen of kynde  desiren libertee
  
And nat to been constreyned as a thral
And so doon men  if I sooth seyen shal
Looke  who þat is moost pacient in loue
He is  at his auantate al aboue
Pacience  is an heigh vertu certeyn
ffor it venquysseth  as thise clerkes seyn
Thynges  þat rigour  sholde neuere atteyne
ffor euery word  men may nat chide or pleyne
Lerneth to suffre  or elles so moot I goon
Ye shul it lerne  wher so ye wole or noon
ffor in this world certein  ther no wight is
That he ne dooth or seith  som tyme amys
Ire  siknesse  or constellacion
Wyn  wo  or chaungynge of complexion
Causeth ful ofte  to doon amys or speken
On euery wrong a man may nat be wreken
After the tyme  moste be temperance
To euery wight þat kan on gouernance
And therfore  hath this wise worthy knyght
To lyue in ese  suffrance hire bihight
And she to hym  ful wisly gan to swere
That neuere  sholde ther be defaute in here
 Heere may men seen  an humble wys accord
Thus hath she take  hir seruant and hir lord
Seruant in love  and lord in mariage
Thanne was he  bothe in lordshipe and seruage
Seruage nay  but in lordshipe aboue
Sith he hath  bothe his lady and his loue
His lady certes  and his wyf also  
The which  þat lawe of loue acordeth to
And whan he was  in this prosperitee
Hoom with his wyf  he gooth to his contree
Nat fer fro Pedmark ther his dwellyng was
Where as he lyueth  in blisse and in solas
 Who koude telle  but he hadde wedded be
The ioye  the ese  and the prosperitee
  
That is  bitwixe an housbonde  and his wyf
A yeer and moore  lasted this blisful lyf
Til þat the knyght of which I speke of thus
That of kayrrud  was cleped Arueragus
Shoope hym to goon  and dwelle a yeer or tweyne
In Engelond  that cleped was eek Briteyne
To seke in Armes  worshipe and honour
ffor al his lust he sette in swich labour
And dwelled there two yeer  the book seith thus
 Now wol I stynten  of this Arueragus
And speken I wole  of Dorigene his wyf
That loueth hire housbonde  as hire hertes lyf
ffor his Absence  wepeth she and siketh
As doon thise noble wyues  whan hem liketh
She moorneth  waketh  wayleth  fasteth  pleyneth
Desir of his presence  hire so distreyneth
That al this wyde world  she sette at noght
Hire freendes  whiche þat knewe hir heuy thoght
Conforten hire  in al þat euer they may
They prechen hire  they telle hire nyght and day
That causelees  she sleeth hir self allas
And euery confort possible in this cas
They doon to hire  with all hire bisynesse
Al  for to make hire  leue hire heuynesse
 By proces  as ye knowen euerichoon
Men may so longe  grauen in a stoon
Til som figure  ther Inne emprented be
So longe han they conforted hire  til she
Receyued hath  by hope and by reson
The emprentyng of hire consolacion
Thurgh which  hir grete sorwe gan aswage
She may nat alwey  duren in swich rage
 And eek Arueragus  in al this care
Hath sent hire lettres hoom  of his welfare
And þat he wol come hastily agayn
Or elles hadde this sorwe  hir herte slayn
  
 Hire freendes sawe  hir sorwe gan to slake
And preyde hire on knees  for goddes sake
To come  and romen hire in compaignye
Awey to dryue  hire derke fantasye
And finally  she graunted that requeste  
ffor wel she saugh  that it was for the beste
 Now stood hire Castel  faste by the See
And often  with hire freendes walketh shee
Hire to disporte  vp on the bank an heigh
Where  as she  many a shipe and barge seigh
Seillynge hir cours  where as hem liste go
But thanne was that a parcel of hire wo
ffor to hir self ful ofte allas seith she
Is ther no shipe  of so manye as I se
Wol bryngen hom my lord  thanne were myn herte
Al warisshed  of hise bittre peynes smerte
 Another tyme  ther wolde she sitte and thynke
And caste hir eyen  dounward fro the brynke
But whan she saugh  the grisly Rokkes blake
ffor verray feere  so wolde hir herte quake
That on hire feet she myghte hire noght sustene
Thanne wolde she  sitte adoun vpon the grene
And pitously  in to the see biholde
And seyn right thus  with sorweful sikes colde
 Eterne god  that thurgh thy purueiaunce
Ledest the world  by certein gouernaunce
In ydel as men seyn  ye no thyng make
But lord  thise grisly  feendly Rokkes blake
That semen rather  a foul confusion
Of werk than any fair creacion
Of swich a parfit wys god and a stable
Why han ye wroght this werk vnresonable
ffor by this werk  South  North  ne West ne Eest
Ther nys yfostred  man  ne bryd ne beest
It dooth no good to my wit but anoyeth
Se ye nat lord  how mankynde it destroyeth
  
An hundred thousand bodyes of mankynde
Han Rokkes slayn  al be they nat in mynde
Which mankynde  is so fair part of thy werk
That thou it madest lyk to thyn owene merk
 Thanne semed it ye hadde a greet chiertee
Toward mankynde  but how thanne may it bee
That ye swiche meenes make  it to destroyen
Whiche meenes do no good  but euere anoyen
I woot wel  clerkes wol seyn as hem leste
By Argumentz  that al is for the beste
Though I kan  the causes nat yknowe
But thilke god  that made wynd to blowe
As kepe my lord  this my conclusion
To clerkes lete I  al this disputison
But wolde god  that alle thise Rokkes blake
Were sonken in to helle for his sake
Thise Rokkes  sleen myn herte for the feere  
Thus wolde she seyn  with many a pitous teere
 Hire freendes sawe  that it was no disport
To romen by the see  but disconfort
And shopen for to pleyen  somwher elles
They leden hire  by Ryueres and by welles
And eek in othere places delitables
They dauncen  and they pleyen  at ches and tables
 So on a day  right in the morwe tyde
Vn to a gardyn  that was ther bisyde
In which  that they hadde maad hir ordinance
Of vitaille  and of oother purueiance
They goon and pleye hem  al the longe day
And this was  in the sixte morwe of May
Which May hadde peynted  with his softe shoures
This gardyn  ful of leues and of floures
And craft of mannes hand so curiously
Arrayed hadde  this gardyn trewely
That neuere  was ther gardyn of swich prys
But if it were  the verray Paradys
  
The odour of floures  and the fresshe sighte
Wolde han maked  any herte lighte
That euere was born  but if to greet siknesse
Or to greet sorwe  helde it in distresse
So ful it was  of beautee with plesance
At after dyner  gonne they to daunce
And synge also  saue Dorigen allone
Which made alwey  hir compleint and hir moone
ffor she ne saugh hym  on the daunce go
That was hir housbonde  and hir loue also
But nathelees  she moste a tyme abyde
And with good hope  lete hir sorwe slyde
 Vp on this daunce  amonges othere men
Daunced a squier  biforn Dorigen
That fressher was  and Iolyer of array
As to my doom  than is the Monthe of May
He syngeth  daunceth  passynge any man
That is  or was  sith þat the world bigan
Therwith he was  if men sholde hym discryue
Oon  of the beste farynge man on lyue
Yong strong right vertuous  and riche and wys
And wel biloued  and holden in greet prys
And shortly  if the sothe I tellen shal
Vnwityng of this Dorigen at al
This lusty Squier  seruant to Venus
Which that ycleped was Aurelius
Hadde loued hire  best of any creature
Two yeer and moore  as was his auenture
But neuere  dorste he tellen hire his greuance  
With outen coppe  he drank al his penance
He was despeyred  no thyng dorste he seye
Saue in his songes  somwhat wolde he wreye
His wo  as in a general compleynyng
He seyde he louede  and was biloued no thyng
Of swich matere  made he manye layes
Songes  compleintes  roundels  virelayes
  
How that he dorste nat his sorwe telle
But langwissheth  as a furye dooth in helle
And dye he moste he seyde  as dide Ekko
ffor Narcisus  that dorste nat telle hir wo
In oother manere  than ye heere me seye
Ne dorste he nat to hire his wo biwreye
Saue that parauenture  som tyme at daunces
Ther yong folk kepen hir obseruaunces
It may wel be  he looked on hir face
In swich a wise  as man þat asketh grace
But no thyng wiste she  of his entente
Nathelees  it happed er they thennes wente
By cause  that he was hire Neighebour
And was a man  of worshipe and honour
And hadde yknowen hym  of tyme yoore
They fille in speche  and forthe moore and moore
Vn to this purpos  drough Aurelius
And whan he saugh his tyme  he seyde thus
 Madame quod he  by god þat this world made
So that I wiste  it myghte youre herte glade
I wolde that day  that youre Arueragus
Wente ouer the see  that I Aurelius
Hadde went ther neuere I sholde haue come agayn
ffor wel I woot my seruyce is in vayn
My gerdon is  but brestyng of myn herte
Madame  reweth vpon my peynes smerte
ffor with a word  ye may me sleen or saue
Heere at youre feet god wolde þat I were graue
I ne haue as now  no leyser moore to seye
Haue mercy sweete  or ye wol do me deye
 She gan to looke  vp on Aurelius
Is this youre wyl quod she  and sey ye thus
Neuere erst quod she  ne wiste I what ye mente
But now Aurelie  I knowe youre entente
By thilke god  that yaf me soule and lyf
Ne shal I neuere  been vntrewe wyf
  
In word ne werk as fer as I haue wit
I wol been his  to whom þat I am knyt
Taak this for fynal answere  as of me
But after that in pley thus seyde she
 Aurelie quod she  by heighe god aboue  
Yet wolde I graunte yow  to been youre loue
Syn I yow se  so pitously complayne
Looke what day  that endelong Britayne
Ye remoeue alle the Rokkes  stoon by stoon
That they ne lette  shipe ne boot to goon
I seye  whan ye han maad  the coost so clene
Of Rokkes  that ther nys no stoon ysene
Thanne wol I  loue yow best of any man
Haue heer my trouthe  in al þat euere I kan
 Is ther noon oother grace  in yow quod he
 No  by that lord quod she that maked me
ffor wel I woot þat it shal neuer bityde
Lat swiche folies  out of youre herte slyde
What deyntee sholde a man  han in his lyf
ffor to go loue  another mannes wyf
That hath hir body  whan so þat hym liketh
 Aurelius  ful ofte soore siketh
Wo was Aurelie  whan þat he this herde
And with a sorweful herte  he thus answerde
 Madame quod he  this were an inpossible
Thanne moot I dye  of sodeyn deth horrible
And with that word  he turned hym anon
Tho coome  hir othere freendes many oon
And in the Aleyes  romeden vp and doun
And no thyng wiste  of this conclusioun
But sodeynly  bigonne reuel newe
Til that the brighte sonne  loste his hewe
ffor Thorisonte  hath reft the sonne his lyght
This is as muche to seye  as it was nyght
And hoom they goon  in ioye and in solas
Saue oonly  wrecche Aurelius allas
  
He to his hous is goon  with sorweful herte
He seeth  he may nat fro his deeth asterte
Hym semed  that he felte his herte colde
Vp to the heuene  hise handes he gan holde
And on hise knowes bare  he sette hym doun
And in his rauyng seyde his orisoun
ffor verray wo  out of his wit he breyde
He nyste what he spak but thus he seyde
With pitous herte  his pleynt hath he bigonne
Vn to the goddes  and first vn to the sonne
 He seyde Appollo  god and gouernour
Of euery plaunte  herbe  tree and flour
That yeuest after thy declinacion
To ech of hem  his tyme and his seson
As thyn herberwe  chaungeth lowe or heighe
Lord Phebus  cast thy merciable eighe  
On wrecche Aurelie  which am but lorn
Lo lord  my lady hath my deeth ysworn
With oute gilt but thy benignytee
Vpon my dedly herte  haue som pitee
ffor wel I woot  lord Phebus  if yow lest
Ye may me helpen  saue my lady best
Now voucheth sauf  þat I may yow deuyse
How þat I may been holpen  and in what wyse
 Youre blisful suster  Lucina the sheene
That of the see  is chief goddesse and queene
Though Neptunus  haue deitee in the See
Yet Emperisse  abouen hym is she
Ye knowen wel lord  that right as hir desir
Is to be quyked  and lightned of youre fir
ffor which  she folweth yow  ful bisily
Right so  the see desireth naturelly
To folwen hire  as she that is goddesse
Bothe in the see  and Ryueres moore and lesse
Wherfore lord Phebus  this is my requeste
Do this miracle  or do myn herte breste
  
That now next at this opposicion
Which in the signe  shal be of the leon
As preieth hire  so greet a flood to brynge
That fyue fadme at the leeste it ouersprynge
The hyeste Rokke  in Armorik  Briteyne
And lat this flood  endure yeres tweyne
Thanne certes  to my lady may I seye
Holdeth youre heste  the Rokkes been aweye
 Lord Phebus  dooth this miracle for me
Preye hire  she go no faster cours than ye
I seye  preyeth your suster  that she go
No faster cours than ye  thise yeres two
Thanne shal she been  euene atte fulle alway
And spryng flood  laste bothe nyght and day
And but she vouche sauf  in swich manere
To graunte me  my souereyn lady deere
Prey hire  to synken euery Rok adoun
In to  hir owene dirke Regioun
Vnder the ground  ther Pluto dwelleth Inne
Or neuere mo  shal I my lady wynne
Thy Temple in Delphos  wol I barefoot seke
Lord Phebus  se the teeris on my cheke
And of my peyne  haue som compassioun
And with that word  in swowne he fil adoun
And longe tyme  he lay forth in a traunce
 His brother which þat knew of his penaunce
Vp caughte hym  and to bedde he hath hym broght
Dispeyred  in this torment and this thoght
Lete I  this woful creature lye  
Chese he for me  wheither he wol lyue or dye
Arueragus  with heele and greet honour
As he  þat was  of chiualrie the flour
Is comen hoom  and othere worthy men
O blisful  artow now  thou Dorigen
That hast thy lusty housbonde in thyne Armes
The fresshe knyght the worthy man of Armes
  
That loueth thee  as his owene hertes lyf
No thyng list hym  to been ymaginatyf
If any wight had spoke  whil he was oute
To hire of loue  he hadde of it no doute
He noght entendeth  to no swich mateere
But daunceth  Iusteth  maketh hire good cheere
And thus  in ioye and blisse  I lete hem dwelle
And of the sike Aurelius  I wol yow telle
IN langour and in torment furyus
Two yeer and moore  lay wrecche Aurelyus
Er any foot  he myghte on erthe gon
Ne confort in this tyme  hadde he noon
Saue of his brother  which þat was a clerk
He knew of al this wo  and al this werk
ffor to noon oother creature certeyn
Of this matere  he dorste no word seyn
Vnder his brest he baar it moore secree
Than euere dide Pamphilus for Galathee
His brest was hool  with oute for to sene
But in his herte  ay was the Arwe kene
And wel ye knowe  that of a Sursanure
In Surgerye  is perilous the cure
But men myghte touche the Arwe  or come therby
His brother  weepe  and wayled pryuely
Til atte laste  hym fil in remembrance
That whiles he was  at Orliens in ffrance
As yonge clerkes  that been lykerous
To reden Artes  that been curious
Seken  in euery halke  and euery herne
Particuler sciences  for to lerne
He hym remembred  that vpon a day
At Orliens in studie  a book he say
Of Magyk natureel  which his felawe
That was that tyme  a Bacheler of lawe
Al were he ther  to lerne another craft
Hadde priuely  vpon his desk ylaft
  
Which book spak muchel  of the operacions
Touchynge  the eighte and twenty mansions
That longen to the moone  and swich folye
As in oure dayes  is nat worth a flye
ffor hooly chirches feith  in oure bileue  
Ne suffreth noon illusion vs to greue
And whan this book  was in his remembraunce
Anon for ioye  his herte gan to daunce
And to hym self he seyde pryuely
My brother shal be warisshed hastily
ffor I am siker  þat ther be sciences
By whce  men make diuerse apparences
Swiche  as thise subtile tregetours pleye
ffor ofte at feestes  haue I wel herd seye
That tregetours  with Inne an halle large
Haue maad come In  a water and a barge
And in the halle  rowen vp and doun
Somtyme  hath semed come a grym leoun
And somtyme floures sprynge  as in a Mede
Somtyme a Vyne  and grapes white and rede
Somtyme a Castel  al of lym and stoon
And whan hym lyked  voyded it anoon
Thus semed it to euery mannes sighte
 Now thanne conclude I thus  þat if I myghte
At Orliens  som oold felawe yfynde
That hadde  this moones mansions in mynde
Or oother Magyk natureel aboue
He sholde wel make  my brother han his loue
ffor with an apparence  a clerk may make
To mannes sighte  þat alle the Rokkes blake
Of Britaigne  weren yvoyded euerichon
And shippes  by the brynke comen and gon
And in swich forme  enduren a wowke or two
Thanne were my brother  warisshed of his wo
Thanne moste she nedes  holden hire biheste
Or elles  he shal shame hire atte leeste
  
 What sholde I make  a lenger tale of this
Vn to his brotheres bed  he comen is
And swich confort he yaf hym for to gon
To Orliens  that he vp stirte anon
And on his wey  forthward thanne is he fare
In hope  for to been lissed of his care
 Whan they were come  almoost to that Citee
But if it were  a two furlong or thre
A yong clerk romynge by hym self they mette
Which þat in latyn  thriftily hem grette
And after that he seyde a wonder thyng
I knowe quod he  the cause of youre comyng
And er they ferther  any foote wente
He tolde hem  al that was in hire entente
 This Briton clerk hym asked of felawes
The whiche þat he had knowe  in olde dawes
And he answerde hym  that they dede were  
ffor which  he weep ful ofte many a teere
 Doun of his hors  Aurelius lighte anon
And with this Magicien  forth is he gon
Hoom to his hous  and maden hem wel at ese
Hem lakked no vitaille  þat myghte hem plese
So wel arrayed hous  as ther was oon
Aurelius in his lyf  saugh neuere noon
 He shewed hym  er he wente to Sopeer
fforestes  Parkes  ful of wilde deer
Ther saugh he hertes  with hir hornes hye
The gretteste  that euere were seyn with eye
He saugh of hem  an hondred slayn with houndes
And somme with Arwes blede  of bittre woundes
 He saugh  whan voyded were thise wilde deer
Thise ffauconers  vpon a fair Ryuer
That with hir haukes  han the heron slayn
 Tho saugh he knyghtes  iustyng in a playn
And after this  he dide hym swich plesaunce
That he hym shewed  his lady on a daunce
  
On which hym self  he daunced  as hym thoughte
And whan this Maister  þat this Magyk wroughte
Saugh it was tyme  he clapte hise handes two
And farewel  al oure reuel was ago
And yet remoeued they neuere  out of the hous
Whil they saugh  al this sighte merueillous
But in his studie  ther as hise bookes be
They seten stille  and no wight but they thre
 To hym  this Maister called his Squier
And seyde hym thus  is redy oure soper
Almoost an houre it is I vndertake
Sith I yow bad  oure soper for to make
Whan that thise worthy men  wenten with me
In to my studie  ther as my bookes be
 Sire quod this Squier  whan it liketh yow
It is al redy  though ye wol right now
Go we thanne soupe quod he  as for the beste
This amorous folk  som tyme moote han hir reste
 At after soper  fille they in tretee
What somme  sholde this Maistres gerdon be
To remoeuen  alle the Rokkes of Britayne
And eek from Gerounde  to the mouth of Sayne
 He made it straunge  and swoor  so god hym saue
Lasse than a thousand pound  he wolde nat haue
Ne gladly  for that somme he wolde nat goon
 Aurelius  with blisful herte anoon
Answerde thus  fy on a thousand pound
This wyde world  which that men seye is round
 I wolde it yeue  if I were lord of it  
This bargayn is ful dryue  for we been knyt
Ye shal be payed  trewely by my trouthe
But looketh now  for no necligence or slouthe
Ye tarie vs heere  no lenger than to morwe
 Nay quod this clerk haue heer my feith to borwe
 To bedde is goon Aurelius  whan hym leste
And wel ny  al that nyght he hadde his reste
  
What for his labour  and his hope of blisse
His woful herte  of penaunce hadde a lisse
 Vpon the morwe  whan þat it was day
To Britaigne  tooke they the righte way
Aurelius  and this Magicien bisyde
And been descended  ther they wolde abyde
And this was  as thise bookes me remembre
The colde  frosty seson of Decembre
Phebus wax old  and hewed lyk laton
That in his hoote declynacion
Shoon as the burned gold  with stremes brighte
But now in Capricorn  adoun he lighte
Where as he shoon ful pale  I dar wel seyn
The bittre frostes  with the sleet and reyn
Destroyed hath the grene  in euery yerd
Ianus sit by the fyr  with double berd
And drynketh  of his bugle horn the wyn
Biforn hym  stant brawen  of the tusked swyn
And Nowel  crieth euery lusty man
 Aurelius  in al that euere he kan
Dooth to his Maister  chiere and reuerence
And preyeth hym  to doon his diligence
To bryngen hym  out of his peynes smerte
Or with a swerd  þat he wolde slitte his herte
 This subtil clerk swich routhe had of this man
That nyght and day  he spedde hym þat he kan
To wayten a tyme  of his conclusion
This is to seye  to maken illusion
By swich a apparence or Iogelrye
I ne kan no termes  of Astrologye
That she and euery wight sholde wene and seye
That of Britaigne  the Rokkes were aweye
Or ellis  they were sonken vnder grounde
So atte laste  he hath his tyme yfounde
To maken hise Iapes  and his wrecchednesse
Of swich  a supersticious cursednesse
  
Hise tables tolletanes  forth he brought
fful wel corrected  ne ther lakked nought
Neither his collect ne hise expans yeeris
Ne hise rootes  ne hise othere geeris
As been his centris  and hise Argumentz  
And hise proporcioneles conuenientz
ffor hise equacions  in euery thyng
And by his 8 speere in his wirkyng
He knew ful wel  how fer Alnath was shoue
ffro the heed  of thilke fixe Aries aboue
That in the 9 speere considered is
fful subtilly  he hadde kalkuled al this
 Whan he hadde founde  his firste mansion
He knew the remenant by proporcion
And knew the arisyng of his moone weel
And in whos face  and terme and euerydeel
And knew ful weel  the moones mansion
Acordaunt to his operacion
And knew also  hise othere obseruances
ffor swiche illusions  and swiche meschances
As hethen folk  vseden in thilke dayes
ffor which  no lenger maked he delayes
But thurgh his magik  for a wyke or tweye
It semed  that alle the Rokkes were aweye
 Aurelius  which þat yet despeired is
Wher he shal han his loue  or fare amys
Awaiteth nyght and day  on this myracle
And whan he knew  þat ther was noon obstacle
That voyded were  thise Rokkes euerychon
Doun  to hise Maistres feet he fil anon
And seyde  I woful wrecche Aurelius
Thanke yow lord  and lady myn Venus
That me han holpen  fro my cares colde
And to the temple  his wey forth hath he holde
Where as he knew  he sholde his lady see
And whan he saugh his tyme  anon right hee
  
With dredful herte  and with ful humble cheere
Salewed hath  his souereyn lady deere
My righte lady  quod this woful man
Whom I moost drede and loue as I best kan
And lothest were  of al this world displese
Nere it þat I for yow  haue swich disese
That I moste dyen heere  at youre foot anon
Noght wolde I telle  how me is wo bigon
But certes  outher moste I dye or pleyne
Ye sle me giltlees  for verray peyne
But of my deeth  thogh þat ye haue no routhe
Auyseth yow  er þat ye breke youre trouthe
Repenteth yow  for thilke god aboue
Er ye me sleen  by cause þat I yow loue
ffor madame  wel ye woot what ye han hight
Nat þat I chalange  any thyng of right
Of yow my souereyn lady  but youre grace  
But in a gardyn yond  at swich a place
Ye woot right wel  what ye bihighten me
And in myn hand  youre trouthe plighten ye
To loue me best god woot ye seyde so
Al be  þat I vnworthy be therto
Madame I speke it  for the honour of yow
Moore than to saue  myn hertes lyf right now
I haue do so  as ye comanded me
And if ye vouche sauf  ye may go see
Dooth as yow list haue youre biheste in mynde
ffor quyk or deed  right there ye shal me fynde
In yow lith al  to do me lyue or deye
But wel I woot the Rokkes been aweye
 He taketh his leue  and she astonied stood
In al hir face  nas a drope of blood
She wende neuere  han come in swich a trappe
Allas quod she  þat euere this sholde happe
ffor wende I neuere  by possibilitee
That swich a Monstre  or merueille myghte be
  
It is  agayns the proces of nature
And hoom she goth  a sorweful creature
ffor verray feere  vnnethe may she go
She wepeth  wailleth  al a day or two
And swowneth  that it routhe was to see
But why it was  to no wight tolde shee
ffor out of towne  was goon Arueragus
But to hir self she spak and seyde thus
With face pale  and with ful sorweful cheere
In hire compleynt as ye shal after heere
 Allas quod she  on thee ffortune I pleyne
That vnwar  wrapped hast me in thy cheyne
ffor which tescape  woot I no scour
Saue oonly  deeth or dishonour
Oon of thise two  bihoueth me to chese
But nathelees  yet haue I leuere to lese
My lif than of my body haue a shame
Or knowe my seluen fals  or lese my name
And with my deth  I may be quyt ywis
Hath ther nat many a noble wyf er this
And many a mayde  yslayn hir self allas
Rather  than with hir body doon trespas
 Yis certes  lo thise stories beren witnesse
Whan xxx tirauntz  ful of cursednesse
Hadde slayn Phidon  in Atthenes at feste
They comanded  hise doghtres for tareste
And bryngen hem  biforn hem in despit
Al naked  to fulfille hir foul delit
And in hir fadres blood  they made hem daunce  
Vpon the pauement god yeue hem myschaunce
ffor which  thise woful maydens ful of drede
Rather  than they wolde lese hir maydenhede
They priuely  been stirt in to a welle
And dreynte hem seluen  as the bookes telle
They of Mecene  leete enquere and seke
Of Lacedomye  fifty maydens eke
  
On whiche  they wolden doon hir lecherye
But was ther noon of al that compaignye
That she nas slayn  and with a good entente
Chees  rather for to dye than assente
To been oppressed  of hir maydenhede
Why sholde I thanne  to dye been in drede
Lo eek  the tiraunt Aristoclides
That loued a mayden  heet Stymphalides
Whan that hir fader  slayn was on a nyght
Vn to Dianes temple  goth she right
And hente the ymage  in hir handes two
ffro which ymage  wolde she neuere go
No wight  ne myghte hir handes of it arace
Til she was slayn  right in the selue place
 Now sith þat maydens  hadden swich despit
To been defouled  with mannes foul delit
Wel oghte a wyf  rather hir seluen slee
Than be defouled  as it thynketh me
What shal I seyn  of Hasdrubales wyf
That at Cartage  birafte hir self hir lyf
ffor whan she saugh  that Romayns wan the toun
She took hir children alle  and skipte adoun
In to the fyr  and chees rather to dye
Than any Romayn  dide hire vileynye
Hath nat Lucresse  yslayn hir self allas
At Rome  whan she oppressed was
Of Tarquyn  for hire thoughte it was a shame
To lyuen  whan she had lost hir name
The seuene maydens  of Melesie also
Han slayn hem self  for drede and wo
Rather than folk of Gawle  hem sholde oppresse
Mo than a thousand stories  as I gesse
Koude I now telle  as touchynge this mateere
Whan habradate was slayn  his wyf so deere
Hirseluen slow  and leet hir blood to glyde
In habradates woundes depe and wyde
  
And seyde my body  at the leeste way
Ther shal no wight  defoulen if I may
 What sholde I  mo ensamples heer of sayn
Sith that so manye  han hem seluen slayn
Wel rather  than they wolde defouled be  
I wol conclude  that it is bet for me
To sleen my self  than been defouled thus
I wol be trewe  vn to Arueragus
Or rather sleen my self in som manere
As dide  Demociones doghter deere
By cause  þat she wolde nat defouled be
OCedasus  it is ful greet pitee
To reden  how thy doghtren deyde allas
That slowe hem self  for swich manere cas
As greet a pitee was it or wel moore
The Theban mayden  that for Nichanore
Hir seluen slow  right for swich manere wo
Another Theban mayden  dide right so
ffor oon of Macidonye  hadde hire oppressed
She with hire deeth  hir maydenhede redressed
What shal I seye of Nicerates wyf
That for swich cas  birafte hir self hir lyf 
How trewe eek was  to Alcebiades
His loue  rather for to dyen chees
Than for to suffre  his body vnburyed be
Lo which a wyf  was Alceste quod she
What seith Omer  of goode Penalopee
Al Grece  knoweth of hire chastitee
Pardee  of Lacedomya  is writen thus
That whan at Troie  was slayn Protheselaus
No lenger wolde she lyue  after his day
The same  of noble Porcia telle I may
With oute Brutus  koude she nat lyue
To whom she hadde  al hool hir herte yeue
The parfit wyfhod of Arthemesie
Honured is  thurgh al the Barbarie
  
O Teuta queene  thy wyfly chastitee
To alle wyues  may a Mirour bee
The same thyng  I seye of Bilyea
Of Rodogone  and eek Valeria
 Thus pleyne Dorigene  a day or tweye
Purposynge euere  that she wolde deye
 But nathelees  vpon the thridde nyght
Hoom cam Arueragus  this worthy knyght
And asked hire  why that she weepe so soore
And she gan wepen  euer lenger the moore
 Allas quod she  that euere I was born
Thus haue I seyd quod she  thus haue I sworn
And toold hym al  as ye han herd bifore
It nedeth nat reherce it yow namoore
 This housbonde  with glad chiere in freendly wyse
Answerde and seyde  as I shal yow deuyse
Is ther oght elles Dorigen  but this  
 Nay nay quod she  god helpe me so as wys
This is to muche  and it were goddes wille
 Ye wyf quod he  lat slepen that is stille
It may be wel  parauenture yet to day
Ye shul youre trouthe  holden by my fay
ffor god so wisly  haue mercy vp on me
I hadde wel leuere  ystiked for to be
ffor verray loue  which that I to yow haue
But if ye sholde  youre trouthe kepe and saue
Trouthe  is the hyeste thyng þat man may kepe
But with that word  he brast anon to wepe
And seyde  I yow forbede  vp peyne deeth
That neuere  whil thee lasteth  lyf ne breeth
To no wight telle thou of this auenture
As I may best I wol my wo endure
Ne make  no contenance of heuynesse
That folk of yow  may demen harm or gesse
 And forth  he cleped  a squier and a mayde
Gooth forth anon  with Dorigen he sayde
  
And bryngeth hire  to swich a place anon
They take hir leue  and on hir wey they gon
But they ne wiste  why she thider wente
He nolde  no wight tellen his entente
 Parauenture  an heepe of yow ywis
Wol holden hym  a lewed man in this
That he wol putte  his wyf in Iupartie
Herkneth the tale  er ye vp on hire crie
She may haue bettre ffortune  than yow semeth
And whan þat ye han herd the tale  demeth
This squier  which þat highte Aurelius
On Dorigen  that was so amorus
Of auenture  happed hire to meete
Amydde the toun  right in the quykkest strete
As she was bown  to goon the wey forth right
Toward the gardyn  ther as she had hight
And he was  to the gardynward also
ffor wel he spyed  whan she wolde go
Out of hir hous  to any maner place
But thus they mette  of auenture or grace
And he saleweth hire  with glad entente
And asked of hire  whiderward she wente
 And she answerde  half as she were mad
Vn to the gardyn  as myn housbonde bad
My trouthe for to holde  allas  allas
 Aurelius  gan wondren on this cas
And in his herte  hadde greet compassion
Of hire  and of hire lamentacion
 And of Arueragus the worthy knyght  
That bad hire holden  al þat she had hight
So looth hym was  his wyf sholde breke hir trouthe
And in his herte  he caughte of this greet routhe
Considerynge  the beste on euery syde
That fro his lust yet were hym leuere abyde
Than doon  so heigh a cherlyssh wrecchednesse
Agayns franchise  and alle gentillesse
  
ffor which  in fewe wordes seyde he thus
 Madame  seyeth to youre lord Arueragus
That sith I se his grete gentillesse
To yow  and eek I se wel youre distresse
That him were leuere han shame  and þat were routhe
Than ye to me  sholde breke thus youre trouthe
I haue wel leuere  euere to suffre wo
Than I departe  the loue bitwix yow two
I yow relesse madame  in to youre hond
Quyt euerysurement and euery bond
That ye han maad to me  as heer biforn
Sith thilke tyme  which þat ye were born
My trouthe I plighte  I shal yow neuer repreue
Of no biheste  and heere I take my leue
As of the treweste  and the beste wyf
That euere yet I knew in al my lyf
But euery wyf be war of hire biheeste
On Dorigene  remembreth  atte leeste
Thus kan a Squier doon a gentil dede
As wel as kan a knyght with outen drede
 She thonketh hym  vp on hir knees al bare
And hoom  vn to hir housbonde is she fare
And tolde hym al  as ye han herd me sayd
And be ye siker  he was so weel apayd
That it were inpossible  me to wryte
What sholde I lenger  of this cas endyte
 Arueragus  and Dorigene his wyf
In souereyn blisse  leden forth hir lyf
Neuere eft ne was ther Angre hem bitwene
He cherisseth hire  as though she were a queene
And she was to hym  trewe for eueremoore
Of thise folk  ye gete of me namoore
Aurelius  that his cost hath al forlorn
Curseth the tyme  þat euere he was born
Allas quod he  allas that I bihighte
Of pured gold  a thousand pound of wighte
  
Vn to this Philosophre  how shal I do
I se namoore  but that I am fordo
Myn heritage  moot I nedes selle
And been a beggere  heere may I nat dwelle
And shamen  al my kynrede in this place  
But I of hym  may gete bettre grace
But nathelees  I wole of hym assaye
At certeyn dayes  yeer by yeer to paye
And thanke hym  of his grete curteisye
My trouthe wol I kepe  I wol nat lye
 With herte soor  he gooth vn to his cofre
And broghte gold  vn to this Philosophre
The value  of fyue hundred pound I gesse
And hym bisecheth of his gentillesse
To graunte hym dayes of the remenaunt
And seyde maister  I dar wel make auaunt
I failled neuere  of my trouthe as yit
ffor sikerly  my dette shal be quyt
Towardes yow  how euere that I fare
To goon a begged  in my kirtle bare
But wolde ye vouche sauf vp on seuretee
Two yeer or thre  for to respiten me
Thanne were I wel  for elles moot I selle
Myn heritage  ther is namoore to telle
This Philosophre  sobrely answerde
And seyde thus  whan he thise wordes herde
Haue I nat holden couenant vn to thee
 Yes certes  wel and trewely quod he
 Hastow nat had thy lady  as thee liketh
 No no quod he  and sorwefully he siketh
 What was the cause  tel me if thou kan
 Aurelius  his tale anon bigan
And tolde hym al  as ye han herd bifoore
It nedeth nat to yow reherce it moore
 He seide  Arueragus of gentillesse
Hadde leuere dye  in sorwe  and in distresse
  
Than þat his wyf  were of hir trouthe fals
The sorwe of Dorigen  he tolde hym als
How looth hire was  to been a wikked wyf
And þat she leuere had lost that day hir lyf
And þat hir trouthe  she swoor thurgh Innocence
She neuere erst hadde herd speke of Apparence
That made me han of hire so greet pitee
And right as frely  as he sente hire me
As frely  sente I hire to hym ageyn
This al and som  ther is namoore to seyn
 This Philosophre answerde  leeue brother
Euerich of yow  dide gentilly til oother
Thou art a Squier  and he is a knyght
But god forbede  for his blisful myght
But if a clerk  koude doon a gentil dede
As wel as any of yow  it is no drede
 Sire  I releesse thee  thy thousand pound  
As thou right now  were cropen out of the ground
Ne neuere er now  ne haddest knowen me
ffor sire  I wol nat taken a peny of thee
ffor al my craft ne noght for my trauaille
Thou hast ypayed wel  for my vitaille
It is ynogh  and farewel haue good day
And took his hors  and forth he goth his way
Lordynges  this question thanne wolde I aske now
Which was the mooste fre as thynketh yow
Now telleth me  er that ye ferther wende
I kan namoore  my tale is at an ende
Ther was  as telleth Titus Liuius
A knyght that was called Virginius
ffulfild  of honour  and of worthynesse
And strong of freendes  and of greet richesse
 This knyght a doghter hadde by his wyf  
No children hadde he mo in al his lyf
ffair was this mayde  in excellent beautee
Abouen euery wight that man may see
ffor Nature  hath with souereyn diligence
Yformed hire  in so greet excellence
As though she wolde seyn  lo I Nature
Thus kan I forme  and peynte a creature
Whan that me list who kan me countrefete
Pigmalion noght  though he ay forge and bete
Or graue  or peynte  for I dar wel seyn
Apelles Zanzis  sholde werche in veyn
Outher to graue  or peynte  or forge  or bete
If they presumed  me to countrefete
ffor he that is the formere principal
Hath maked me  his vicaire general
To forme and peynten erthely creaturis
Right as me list and ech thyng in my cure is
Vnder the Moone  þat may wane and waxe
And for my werk right no thyng wol I axe
  
My lord and I  been ful of oon accord
I made hire  to the worshipe of my lord
So do I  alle myne othere creatures
What colour that they han  or what figures
Thus semeth me  that Nature wolde seye  
 This mayde of Age xij yeer was and tweye
In which þat Nature  hadde swich delit
ffor right as she kan peynte a lilie whit
And reed a Rose  right with swich peynture
She peynted hath this noble creature
Er she were born  vpon hir lymes fre
Where as by right  swiche colours sholde be
And Phebus dyed hath  hire treses grete
Lyk to the stremes  of his burned heete
And if þat excellent was hire beautee
A thousand foold  moore vertuous was she
In hire  ne lakked no condicion
That is to preyse  as by discrecion
As wel in goost as body  chast was she
ffor which  she floured in virginitee
With alle humylitee  and Abstinence
With alle attemperaunce and pacience
With mesure eek  of beryng and array
Discreet she was  in answeryng alway
Though she were wise Pallas dar I seyn
Hir facound eek  ful wommanly a pleyn
No countrefeted termes  hadde she
To seme wys  but after hir degree
She spak  and alle hire wordes moore and lesse
Sownynge in vertu  and in gentillesse
Shamefast she was   maydens shamefastnesse
Constant in herte  and euere in bisynesse
To dryue hire  out of ydel slogardye
Bacus hadde of hire mouth  right no maistrie
ffor wyn and youthe  dooth Venus encresse
As man in fyr  wol wasten oille or greesse
  
And of hir owene vertu  vnconstreyned
She hath ful ofte tyme syk hire feyned
ffor that she wolde fleen the compaignye
Where likly was  to treten of folye
As is at feestes  reuels  and at daunces
That been  occasions of daliaunces
Swich thyng  maken children for to be
To soone rype and boold  as men may se
Which is ful perilous  and hath been yoore
ffor al to soone  may they lerne loore
Of booldnesse  whan she woxen is a wyf
 And ye maistresses  in youre olde lyf
That lordes doghtres  han in gouernance
Ne taketh of my wordes no displesance
Thenketh  that ye been set in gouernynges
Of lordes doghtres  oonly for two thynges
Outher  for ye han kept youre honestee  
Or elles  ye han falle in freletee
And knowen wel ynough the olde daunce
And han forsaken  fully swich meschaunce
ffor eueremo  therfore for Cristes sake
To teche hem vertu  looke þat ye ne slake
 A theef of venyson  that hath forlaft
His likerousnesse  and al his olde craft
Kan kepe a fforest best of any man
Now kepeth wel  for if ye wolde ye kan
Looke wel  þat ye  vnto no vice assente
Lest ye be dampned  for youre wikke entente
ffor who so dooth  a traitour is certeyn
And taketh kepe  of that þat I shal seyn
Of alle tresons  souereyn pestilence
Is  whan a wight bitrayseth Innocence
 Ye fadres and ye moodres  eek also
Though ye han children  be it oon or two
Youre is the charge  of al hir surueiance
Whil þat they been  vnder youre gouernance
  
Beth war  if by ensample  of youre lyuynge
Or by youre necligence  in chastisynge
That they perisse  for I dar wel seye
If þat they doon  ye shul it deere abeye
Vnder a shepherde  softe and necligent
The wolf  hath many a sheepe and lamb torent
    
    
This mayde  of which I wol this tale expresse
So kepte hir self hir neded no maistresse
ffor in hir lyuyng maydens myghten rede
As in a book euery good word or dede
That longeth to a mayden vertuous
She was so prudent and so bounteuous
ffor which  the fame  out sprong on euery syde
Bothe of hir beautee and hir bountee wyde
That thurgh that land  they preised hire echone
That loued vertu  saue Enuye allone
That sory is  of oother mennes wele
And glad is of his sorwe  and his vnheele
The doctour  maketh this descripcioun
This mayde vpon a day  wente in the toun
Toward a temple  with hire mooder deere
As is  of yonge maydens the manere
 Now was ther thanne  a Iustice in that toun
That gouernour was  of that Regioun
And so bifel  this Iuge  hise eyen caste
Vpon this mayde  auysynge hym ful faste
As she cam forby  ther as this Iuge stood
Anon  his herte chaunged and his mood
So was he caught with beautee of this mayde  
And to hym self  ful pryuely he sayde
This mayde  shal be myn  for any man
 Anon the feend  into his herte ran
And taughte hym sodeynly  þat he by slyghte
The mayden  to his purpos wynne myghte
  
ffor certes by no force  ne by no meede
Hym thoughte  he was nat able for to speede
ffor she was strong of freendes  and eek she
Confermed was  in swich souerayn bountee
That wel he wiste  he myghte hire neuere wynne
As for to maken hire  with hir body synne
ffor which  by greet deliberacioun
He sente after a cherl  was in the toun
Which þat he knew  for subtil and for boold
This Iuge  vnto this cherl  his tale hath toold
In secree wise  and made hym to ensure
He sholde telle it to no creature
And if he dide  he sholde lese his heed
Whan þat assented was  this cursed reed
Glad was this Iuge  and maked him greet cheere
And yaf hym yiftes  preciouse and deere
 Whan shapen was  al hire conspiracie
ffro point to point how þat his lecherie
Parfourned sholde been ful subtilly
As ye  shul heere it after openly
Hoom gooth the cherl  þat highte Claudius
This false Iuge  that highte Apius
So was his name  for this is no fable
But knowen  for historial thyng notable
The sentence of it sooth is out of doute
This false Iuge  gooth now faste aboute
To hasten his delit al that he may
And so bifel  soone after on a day
This false Iuge  as telleth vs the storie
As he was wont sat in his Consistorie
And yaf his doomes  vpon sondry cas
This false cherl  cam forth  a ful greet pas
And seyde lord  if þat it be youre wille
As dooth me right vpon this pitous bille
In which I pleyne  vpon Virginius
And if þat he wol seyn  it is nat thus
  
I wol it preeue  and fynde good witnesse
That sooth is  that my bille wol expresse
 The Iuge answerde  of this in his absence
I may nat yeue  diffynyue sentence
Lat do hym calle  and I wol gladly heere
Thou shalt haue al right and no wrong heere
 Virginius  cam to wite the Iuges wille  
And right anon  was rad this cursed bille
The sentence of it  was as ye shul heere
 To yow my lord  sire Apius so deere
Sheweth youre poure seruant Claudius
How that a knyght  called Virginius
Agayns the lawe  agayn al equitee
Holdeth expres  agayn the wyl of me
My seruant which þat is my thral by right
Which fro myn hous  was stole vpon a nyght
Whil þat she was ful yong this wol I preeue
By witnesse lord  so þat it nat yow greeue
She nys his doghter nat what so he seye
Wherfore  to yow  my lord the Iuge I preye
yeld me my thral  if þat it be youre wille
Lo  this was  al the sentence of his bille
 Virginius  gan vpon the cherl biholde
But hastily  er he his tale tolde
And wolde haue preeued it as sholde a knyght
And eek by witnessyng of many a wight
That it was fals  that seyde his Aduersarie
This cursed Iuge  wolde no thyng tarie
Ne heere a word moore of Virginius
But yaf his Iuggement and seyde thus
 I deeme anon  this cherl his seruant haue
Thou shalt no lenger  in thyn hous hir saue
Go bryng hire forth  and put hire in oure warde
The cherl shal haue his thral  this I awarde
 And whan this worthy knyght Virginius
Thurgh sentence  of this Iustice Apius
  
Moste by force  his deere doghter yeuen
Vnto the Iuge  in lecherie to lyuen
He gooth hym hoom  and sette him in his halle
And leet anon  his deere doghter calle
And with a face deed  as asshen colde
Vpon hir humble face  he gan biholde
With fadres pitee  stikynge thurgh his herte
Al wolde he  from his purpos nat conuerte
Doghter quod he  Virginia  by thy name
Ther been two weyes  outher deeth or shame
That thou most  suffre  allas þat I was bore
ffor neuere  thou deseruedest wherfore
To dyen  with a swerd  or with a knyf
O deere doghter  endere of my lyf
Which I haue fostred vp  with swich plesance
That thou were neuere  out of my remembrance
O doghter  which þat art my laste wo
And in my lyf my laste ioye also
O gemme o Chastitee in pacience  
Take thou thy deeth  for this is my sentence
ffor loue and nat for hate  thou most be deed
My pitous hand  moot smyten of thyn heed
Allas  that euere Apius the say
Thus hath he falsly  Iugged the to day
And tolde hire al the cas  as ye bifore
Han herd  nat nedeth for to telle it moore
 O mercy deere fader  quod this mayde
And with that word  she both hir Armes layde
About his nekke  as she was wont to do
The teeris  bruste out of hir eyen two
And seyde  goode fader shal I dye
Is ther no grace  is ther no remedye
 No certes  deere doghter myn quod he
 Thanne yif me leyser  fader myn quod she
My deeth for to compleyne  a litel space
ffor pardee Iepte yaf his doghter grace  
ffor to compleyne  er he hir slow allas
And god it woot no thyng was hir trespas
But for she ran  hir fader for to see
To welcome hym  with greet solempnitee
And with that word  she fil aswowne anon
And after whan hir swownyng is agon
She riseth vp  and to hir fader sayde
Blissed be god  that I shal dye a mayde
Yif me my deeth  er that I haue a shame
Dooth with youre child  youre wyl a goddes name
 And with that word  she preyed hym ful ofte
That with his swerd  he wolde smyte softe
And with that word  aswowne doun she fil
Hir fader  with ful sorweful herte and wil
Hir heed of smoot and by the tope it hente
And to the Iuge  he gan it to presente
As he sat yet in doom in Consistorie
And whan the Iuge it saugh  as seith the storie
He bad to take hym  and anhange hym faste
But right anon  a thousand peple in thraste
To saue the knyght for routhe and for pitee
ffor knowen was  the false Iniquitee
The peple anon  hath suspect of this thyng
By manere  of the cherles chalangyng
That it was  by the assent of Apius
They wisten wel  that he was lecherus
ffor which  vnto this Apius they gon
And caste hym in a prison right anon
Ther as he slow hym self and Claudius
That seruant was  vnto this Apius
And demed  for to hange vpon a tree  
But that Virginius  of his pitee
So preyde for hym  that he was exiled
And elles certes  he had been bigyled
The remenant were anhanged moore and lesse
That were consentant of this cursednesse
  
Heere men may seen  how synne hath his merite
Beth war  for no man woot whom god wol smyte
In no degree  ne in which manere wyse
The worm of conscience  may agryse
Of wikked lyf though it so pryuee be
That no man  woot therof but god and he
ffor be he lewed man  or ellis lered
He noot how soone  þat he shal been afered
Therfore I rede yow  this conseil take
fforsaketh synne  er synne yow forsake
Ovre Hoost gan to swere  as he were wood
Harrow quod he  by nayles and by blood
This was a fals cherl and a fals Iustise
As shameful deeth  as herte may deuyse
Come to thise false Iuges  and hire Aduocatz
Algate  this sely mayde  is slayn allas
Allas  to deere boughte she beautee
Wherfore I seye  al day  as men may see
That yiftes of ffortune and of Nature
Been cause of deeth  to many a creature
    
    
Of bothe yiftes  that I speke of now
Men han ful ofte  moore for harm than prow
 But trewely  myn owene maister deere
This is  a pitous tale for to heere
But nathelees  passe ouer  is no fors
I pray to god  so saue thy gentil cors
And eek thyne vrynals  and thy Iurdones
Thyn ypocras  and eek thy Galiones
And euery boyste  ful of thy letuarie
God blesse hem  and oure lady Seint Marie
So moot I theen  thou art a propre man
And lyk a prelat by Seint Ronyan
Seyde I nat wel  I kan nat speke in terme
But wel I woot thou doost myn herte to erme
That I almoost haue caught a Cardynacle  
By corpus bones  but I haue triacle
Or elles a draughte  of moyste and corny Ale
Or but I heere anon  a myrie tale
  
Myn herte is lost for pitee of this mayde
Thou beel amy  thou Pardoner he sayde
Telle vs som myrthe  or Iapes right anon
 It shal be doon quod he  by Seint Ronyon
But first quod he  heere at this Ale stake
I wol bothe drynke  and eten of a Cake
 And right anon  the gentils gonne to crye
Nay  lat hym telle vs of no ribaudye
Telle vs som moral thyng þat we may leere
Som wit and thanne wol we gladly heere
 I graunte ywis quod he  but I moot thynke
Vpon som honeste thyng while þat I drynke

LOrdynges quod he  in chirches  whan I preche
I peyne me  to han an hauteyn speche
And rynge it out as round as gooth a belle
ffor I kan  al by rote that I telle
My theme is alwey oon  and euere was
Radix malorum est Cupiditas
First I pronounce  whennes þat I come
And thanne my bulles  shewe I alle and some
Oure lige lordes seel  on my patente
That shewe I first my body to warente
That no man be so boold  ne preest ne clerk
Me to destourbe  of Cristes hooly werk
And after that thanne telle I forth my tales

1Bulles of popes1 and of Cardynales
Of Patriarkes  and bishoppes I shewe
And in latyn  I speke a wordes fewe
To saffron with my predicacion
And for to stire hem  to deuocion
Thanne shewe I forth  my longe cristal stones
Ycrammed ful of cloutes and of bones
Relikes been they  as wenen they echoon
Thanne haue  in laton a sholder boon
Which that was  of an hooly Iewes sheepe
Goode men I seye  taak of my wordes keepe
If that this boon  be wasshe in any welle  
If Cow  or Calf or Sheepe  or Oxe swelle
That any worm hath ete  or worm ystonge
Taak water of that welle  and wassh his tonge
  
And it is hool anon  and forthermoor
Of pokkes  and of scabbe  and euery soor
Shal euery sheepe be hool  þat of this welle
Drynketh a draughte  taak kepe eek what I telle
 If that the goode man  that the beestes oweth
Wol euery wyke  er that the Cok hym croweth
ffastynge drinke  of this welle a draughte
As thilke hooly Iew  oure eldres taughte
Hise beestes and his stoor shal multiplie
 And sire  also  it heeleth Ialousie
ffor though a man  be falle in Ialous rage
Lat maken  with this water his potage
And neuere shal he moore  his wyf mystriste
Though he the soothe  of hir defaute wiste
Al had she  taken preestes  two or thre
 Heere is a Miteyn eek that ye may se
He þat his hand wol putte in this Mitayn
He shal haue  multipliyng of his grayn
Whan he hath sowen  be it whete or Otes
So þat he offre  pens  or elles grotes
 Goode men and wommen  o thyng warne I yow
If any wight  be in this chirche now
That hath doon synne horrible þat he
Dar nat for shame  of it yshryuen be
Or any womman  be she yong or old
That hath ymaked  hir housbonde Cokewold
Swich folk shal haue no power ne no grace
To offren  to my relikes in this place
And who so fyndeth hym  out of swich fame
They wol come vp  and offre on goddes name
And I assoille hem  by the Auctoritee
Which that by bulle  ygraunted was to me
 By this gaude  haue I wonne  yeer by yeer
An hundred mark sith I was Pardoner
I stonde lyk a clerk in my pulpet
And whan the lewed peple  is doun yset
  
I preche so  as ye han herd bifoore
And telle  an hundred false Iapes moore
Thanne peyne I me  to strecche forth the nekke
And Est and West vpon the peple I bekke
As dooth a dowue  sittynge  on a berne
Myne handes and my tonge goon so yerne
That it is ioye  to se my bisynesse
Of Auarice  and of swich cursednesse
Is al my prechyng for to make hem free  
To yeuen hir pens  and namely vnto me
ffor myn entente  is nat but for to wynne
And no thyng for correccion of synne
I rekke neuere  whan they been beryed
Though þat hir soules  goon a blakeberyed
ffor certes  many a predicacion
Comth ofte tyme  of yuel entencion
Som for plesance of folk and flaterye
To been auaunced  by ypocrisye
And som for veyne glorie  and som for hate
ffor whan  I dar noon oother weyes debate
Thanne wol I stynge hym  with my tonge smerte
In prechyng  so that he shal nat asterte
To been defamed falsly  if that he
Hath trespased  to my bretheren  or to me
ffor though I telle noght  his propre name
Men shal wel knowe  that it is the same
By signes  and by othere circumstances
Thus quyte I folk that doon vs displesances
Thus spitte I out my venym  vnder hewe
Of hoolynesse  to semen hooly and trewe
 But shortly myn entente I wol deuyse
I preche of no thyng but for coueityse
Therfore  my theme is yet and euere was
Radix malorum est Cupiditas
Thus kan I preche  agayn that same vice
Which þat I vse  and that is Auarice
  
But though my self be gilty in that synne
Yet kan I maken  oother folk to twynne
ffrom Auarice  and soore to repente
But that is nat my principal entente
I preche no thyng but for coueitise
Of this mateere  it oghte ynogh suffise
 Thanne telle I hem  ensamples many oon
Of olde stories  longe tyme agoon
ffor lewed peple  louen tales olde
Swiche thynges  kan they wel reporte and holde
What trowe ye  the whiles I may preche
And wynne  gold and siluer  for I teche
That I wol lyue in pouerte wilfully
Nay nay  I thoghte it neuere trewely
ffor I wol preche  and begge in sondry landes
I wol nat do no labour with myne handes
Ne make baskettes  and lyue therby
By cause  I wol nat beggen ydelly
I wol noon  of the Apostles countrefete
I wol haue moneie  wolle chese and whete
Al were it yeuen  of the pouereste page  
Or of the pouereste wydwe  in a village
Al sholde hir children sterue  for famyne
Nay  I wol drynke  licour of the vyne
And haue a ioly wenche  in euery toun
But herkneth lordynges in conclusioun
 Youre likyng is  that I shal telle a tale
Now  haue I dronke a draughte of corny ale
By god  I hope  I shal yow telle a thyng
That shal by reson  been at youre likyng
ffor though my self be a ful vicious man
A moral tale  yet I yow telle kan
Which I am wont to preche  for to wynne
Now hoold youre pees  my tale I wol bigynne

IN fflaundres whilom was a compaignye
Of yonge folk that haunteden folye
As Riot hasard  stywes  and Tauernes
Where  as  with harpes  lutes and Gyternes
They daunce  and pleyen at dees  bothe day and nyght
And eten also  and drynken ouer hir myght 
Thurgh which  they doon the deuel sacrifise
WithInne that deueles temple in cursed wise
By superfluytee abhomynable
Hir othes  been so grete and so dampnable
That it is grisly  for to heere hem swere
Oure blissed lordes body  they totere
Hem thoughte  þat Iewes  rente hym noght ynough
And ech of hem  at otheres synne lough
And right anon  thanne comen Tombesteres
ffetys and smale  and yonge ffrutesteres
Syngeres with harpes  Baudes  wafereres
Whiche been  the verray deueles Officeres
To kyndle and blowe  the fyr of lecherye
That is annexed vnto glotonye
The hooly writ take I to my witnesse
That luxurie  is in wyn and dronkenesse
Lo how þat dronken Looth vnkyndely
Lay by hise doghtres two vnwityngly
So dronke he was  he nyste what he wroghte
 Herodes  who so  wel the stories soghte
    

   Whan he of wyn  was repleet at his feeste
Right at his owene table  he yaf his heeste
To sleen the Baptist Iohn  ful giltelees
 Senec seith a good word doutelees
He seith  he kan no difference fynde  
Bitwix a man  that is out of his mynde
And a man  which that is dronkelewe
But that woodnesse  fallen in a shrewe
Perseuereth lenger than dooth dronkenesse
O glotonye  ful of cursednesse
O cause first of oure confusion
O original  of oure dampnacion
Til Crist hadde boght vs  with his blood agayn
Lo  how deere  shortly for to sayn
Aboght was  thilke cursed vileynye
Corrupt was al this world for glotonye
 Adam oure fader  and his wyf also
ffro Paradys  to labour and to wo
Were dryuen for that vice  it is no drede
ffor whil þat Adam fasted  as I rede
He was in Paradys  and whan þat he
Eet of the fruyt deffended on the tree
Anon he was out cast to wo and peyne
O glotonye  on thee wel oghte vs pleyne
O wiste a man  how manye maladyes
ffolwen of excesse  and of glotonyes
He wolde been  the moore mesurable
Of his diete  sittynge at his table
Allas  the shorte throte  the tendre mouth
Maketh þat Est and West and North and South
In Erthe  in Eir  in water man to swynke
To gete a gloton  deyntee mete and drynke
Of this matiere  o Paul wel kanstow trete
Mete vnto wombe  and wombe eek vnto mete
Shal god destroyen bothe  as Paulus seith
Allas  a foul thyng is it by my feith
  
To seye this word  and fouler is the dede
Whan man so drynketh  of the white and rede
That of his throte  he maketh his pryuee
Thurgh thilke cursed superfluitee
 The Apostel wepyng seith ful pitously
Ther walken manye  of whiche yow toold haue I
I seye it now wepyng with pitous voys
Ther been enemys of Cristes croys
Of whiche the ende is deeth  wombe is hir god
O wombe  o bely  o stynkyng Cod
ffulfilled of donge  and of corrupcioun
At either ende of thee  foul is the soun
How greet labour and cost is thee to fynde
Thise Cookes  how they stampe  and streyne and grynde
And turnen substaunce into Accident
To fulfillen  al thy likerous talent
Out of the harde bones knokke they  
The mary  for they caste noght awey
That may go thurgh the golet softe and swoote
Of spicerie  of leef  and bark and roote
Shal been his sauce ymaked by delit
To make hym yet a newer appetit
But certes  he that haunteth swiche delices
Is deed  whil þat he lyueth in tho vices
 A lecherous thyng is wyn and dronkenesse
Is ful of stryuyng and of wrecchednesse
O dronke man  disfigured is thy face
Sour is thy breeth  foul artow to embrace
And thurgh thy dronke nose  semeth the soun
As though thou seydest ay Sampsoun Sampsoun
And yet god woot Sampsoun drank neuere no wyn
Thou fallest as it were a styked swyn
Thy tonge is lost and al thyn honeste cure
ffor dronkenesse  is verray sepulture
Of mannes wit and his discrecion
In whom þat drynke hath dominacion
  
He kan no conseil kepe  it is no drede
Now kepe yow  fro the white and fro the rede
And namely  fro the white wyn of lepe
That is to selle  in ffysshstrete  or in Chepe
This wyn of Spaigne  crepeth subtilly
In othere wynes  growynge faste by
Of which ther ryseth swich fumositee
That whan a man hath dronken draughtes thre
And weneth  that he be at hoom in Chepe
He is in Spaigne  right at the toune of lepe
Nat at the Rochele  ne at Burdeux toun
And thanne wol he seye  Sampsoun Sampsoun
 But herkneth lordes  o word I yow preye
That alle the souereyn Actes dar I seye
Of victories  in the olde testament
Thurgh verray god  þat is omnipotent
Were doon in Abstinence  and in preyere
Looketh the Bible  and ther ye may it leere
 Looke Attilla the grete Conquerour
Deyde in his sleepe  with shame and dishonour
Bledynge ay at his nose in dronkenesse
A Capitayn  sholde lyue in sobrenesse
And ouer al this  auyseth yow right wel

Redeth the Bible  and fynde it expresly
Of wyn yeuyng to hem þat han Iustise

And of deceite  and cursed forswerynges
Blasphemyng of crist manslaughtre and wast also
Of catel and of tyme  and forthermo
It is repreeue  and contrarie of honour
ffor to ben holde  a commune hasardour
  
And euer the hyer he is of estaat
The moore  is he holden desolaat
If that a Prynce  vseth hasardrye
In alle gouernance and policye
He is  as by commune opinion
Yholde the lasse  in reputacion
 Stilbon  that was a wys embassadour
Was sent to Corynthe  in ful greet honour
ffro Lacidomye  to maken hire Alliaunce
And whan he cam  hym happed par chaunce
That alle the gretteste  that were of that lond
Pleyynge atte hasard  he hem fond
ffor which  as soone  as it myghte be
He stal hym hoom agayn  to his contree
And seyde  ther wol I nat lese my name
Ne I wol nat take on me so greet defame
Yow for to allie  vnto none hasardours
Sendeth  othere wise Embassadours
ffor by my trouthe  me were leuere dye
Than I yow sholde  to hasardours allye
ffor ye that been  so glorious in honours
Shul nat allyen yow  with hasardours
As by my wyl  ne as by my tretee
This wise Philosophre  thus seyde hee
 Looke eek that the kyng Demetrius
The kyng of Parthes as the book seith vs
Sente him  a paire of dees of gold in scorn
ffor he hadde vsed  hasard therbiforn
ffor which  he heeld his glorie  or his renoun
At no value  or reputacioun
Lordes may fynden  oother maner pley
Honeste ynough  to dryue the day awey
Now wol I speke  of othes false and grete
A word or two  as olde bookes trete
Gret sweryng is a thyng abhominable
And fals sweryng is yet moore repreuable
  
The heighe god  forbad sweryng at al
Witnesse on Mathew  but in special
Of sweryng seith the hooly Ieremye
Thou shalt seye sooth thyne othes and nat lye
And swere in doom  and eek in rightwisnesse  
But ydel sweryng is a cursednesse
Bihoold and se  that in the firste table
Of heighe goddes heestes honurable
Hou  that the seconde heeste  of hym  is this
Take nat my name  in ydel or amys
Lo rather he forbedeth swich sweryng
Than homycide  or any cursed thyng
I seye  that as by ordre  thus it stondeth
This knowen  that hise heestes vnderstondeth
How þat  the seconde heeste of god is that
And forther ouer  I wol thee telle al plat
That vengeance  shal nat parten from his hous
That of hise othes  is to outrageous
By goddes precious herte  and by his nayles
And by the blood of Crist that is in Hayles
Seuene is my chaunce  and thyn is cynk and treye
By goddes Armes  if thou falsly pleye
This daggere  shal thurghout thyn herte go
This fruyt cometh  of the bicched bones two
fforsweryng Ire  falsnesse  Homycide
Now for the loue of Crist þat for vs dyde
Lete youre othes  bothe grete and smale
But sires  now wol I telle forth my tale
THise Riotours thre  of whiche I telle
Longe erst er prime rong of any belle
Were set hem  in a Tauerne to drynke
And as they sat they herde a belle clynke
Biforn a cors  was caried  to his graue
That oon of hem  gan callen to his knaue
Go bet quod he  and axe redily
What cors is this  þat passeth heer forby
  
And looke  þat thou reporte his name weel
 Sire quod this boy  it nedeth neueradeel
It was me toold  er ye cam heer two houres
He was pardee  an old felawe of youres
And sodeynly  he was yslayn tonyght
ffordronke  as he sat on his bench vpright
Ther cam a priuee theef men clepeth deeth
That in this contree  al the peple sleeth
And with his spere  he smoot his herte atwo
And wente his wey  withouten wordes mo
He hath  a thousand slayn this pestilence
And maister  er ye come in his presence
Me thynketh  that it were necessarie
ffor to be war  of swich an Aduersarie
Beth redy  for to meete hym eueremoore
Thus taughte me my dame  I sey namoore
By seinte Marie seyde this Tauerner  
The child seith sooth  for he hath slayn this yeer
Henne ouer a Mile  withInne a greet village
Bothe man and womman  child and hyne  and page
I trowe  his habitacion be there
To been auysed  greet wysdom it were
Er that he dide a man  a dishonour
 Ye goddes Armes  quod this Riotour
Is it swich peril  with hym for to meete
I shal hym seke  by wey and eek by strete
I make auow  to goddes digne bones
Herkneth felawes  we thre been al ones
Lat ech of vs  holde vp his hand til oother
And ech of vs  bicomen otheres brother
And we wol sleen  this false traytour deeth
He shal be slayn  which þat so manye sleeth
By goddes dignitee  er it be nyght
 Togidres han thise thre  hir trouthes plight
To lyue and dyen  ech of hem for oother
As though he were  his owene yborn brother
  
And vp they stirte  and dronken in this rage
And forth they goon  towardes that village
Of which the Tauerner hadde spoke biforn
And many a grisly ooth  thanne han they sworn
And Cristes blessed body  they torente
Deeth shal be deed  if that they may hym hente
 Whan they han goon  nat fully half a Mile
Right as they wolde  han troden ouer a stile
An oold man and a poure  with hem mette
This olde man  ful mekely hem grette
And seyde thus  now lordes  god yow see
 The proudeste  of thise Riotours three
Answerde agayn  what carl with sory grace
Why artow  al forwrapped saue thy face
Why lyuestow so longe  in so greet age
 This olde man  gan looke in his visage
And seyde thus  for I ne kan nat fynde
A man  though þat I walked in to ynde
Neither in Citee  nor in no Village
That wolde chaunge  his youthe for myn Age
And therfore  moot I han myn Age stille
As longe tyme  as it is goddes wille
 Ne deeth allas  ne wol nat han my lyf
Thus walke I  lyk a restelees kaityf
And on the ground  which is my moodres gate
I knokke with my staf  bothe erly and late
And seye  leeue mooder leet me In
Lo how I vanysshe  flessh and blood and skyn
Allas  whan shul  my bones been at reste  
Mooder  with yow  wolde I chaunge my cheste
That in my chambre  longe tyme hath be
Ye for an heyre clowt to wrappe me
But yet to me  she wol nat do that grace
ffor which  ful pale  and welked is my face
 But sires to yow  it is no curteisye
To speken  to an old man vileynye
  
But he trespasse  in word  or elles in dede
In hooly writ ye may your self wel rede
Agayns an oold man  hoor vpon his heed
Ye sholde arise  wherfore I yeue yow reed
Ne dooth vnto an oold man  noon harm now
Namoore than þat ye wolde  men did to yow
In age  if that ye so longe abyde
And god be with yow  where ye go or ryde
I moote go thider  as I haue to go
 Nay olde cherl  by god thou shalt nat so
Seyde this oother hasardour anon
Thou partest nat so lightly  by Seint Iohn
Thou spak right now  of thilke traytour deeth
That in this contree  alle oure freendes sleeth
Haue heer my trouthe  as thou art his espye
Telle where he is  or thou shalt it abye
By god  and by the hooly sacrement
ffor soothly  thou art oon of his assent
To sleen vs yonge folk  thou false theef
 Now sires quod he  if þat ye be so leef
To fynde deeth  turne vp this croked wey
ffor in that groue  I lafte hym by my fey
Vnder a tree  and there he wole abyde
Noght for youre boost he wole him no thyng hyde
Se ye that ook right there ye shal hym fynde
God saue yow þat boghte agayn mankynde
And yow amende  thus seyde this olde man
And euerich  of thise Riotours ran
Til he cam to that tree  and ther they founde
Of floryns fyne of gold ycoyned rounde
Wel ny an viij busshels  as hem thoughte
No lenger thanne  after deeth they soughte
But ech of hem  so glad was of that sighte
ffor þat the floryns  been so faire and brighte
That doun they sette hem  by this precious hoord
The worste of hem  he spak the firste word
  
 Bretheren quod he  taak kepe what I seye
My wit is greet though þat I bourde and pleye
This tresor  hath ffortune vnto vs yeuen
In myrthe and Ioliftee  oure lyf to lyuen
And lightly as it comth  so wol we spende  
Ey goddes precious dignitee  who wende
Today  that we sholde han so fair a grace
But myghte this gold  be caried fro this place
Hoom to myn hous  or elles vnto youres
ffor wel ye woot þat al this gold is oures
Thanne were we  in heigh felicitee
But trewely  by daye it may nat bee
Men wolde seyn  þat we were theues stronge
And for oure owene tresor doon vs honge
This tresor  moste ycaried be by nyghte
As wisely  and as slyly  as it myghte
Wherfore I rede  þat Cut among vs alle
Be drawe  and lat se  wher the Cut wol falle
And he þat hath the Cut with herte blithe
Shal renne to towne  and that ful swithe
And brynge vs breed and wyn  ful priuely
And two of vs  shul kepen subtilly
This tresor wel  and if he wol nat tarie
Whan it is nyght we wol this tresor carie
By oon assent  where as vs thynketh best
That oon of hem  the Cut broghte in his fest
And bad hym drawe  and looke where it wol falle
And it fil  on the yongeste of hem alle
And forth toward the toun  he wente anon
And al so soone  as that he was gon
That oon spak thus  vnto that oother
Thow knowest wel  thou art my sworn brother
Thy profit wol I telle thee anon
Thou woost wel  that oure felawe is agon
And heere is gold  and that ful greet plentee
That shal departed been  among vs thre
  
But nathelees  if I kan shape it so
That it departed were  among vs two
Hadde I nat doon  a freendes torn to thee
 That oother answerde  I noot hou that may be
He woot how that the gold is with vs tweye
Whal we doon  what shal we to hym seye
 Shal it be conseil  seyde the firste shrewe
And I shal tellen  in a wordes fewe
What we shal doon  and bryngen it wel aboute
 I graunte quod that oother  out of doute
That by my trouthe  I shal thee nat biwreye
 Now quod the firste  thou woost wel we be tweye
And two of vs  shul strenger be than oon
Looke whan þat he is set that right anoon
Arys  as though thou woldest with hym pleye
And I shal  ryue hym  thurgh the sydes tweye
Whil that thou strogelest with hym  as in game  
And with thy daggere  looke thou do the same
And thanne  shal al this gold  departed be
My deere freend  bitwixen me and thee
Thanne may we  bothe oure lustes all fulfille
And pleye at dees  right at oure owene wille
And thus  acorded been thise shrewes tweye
To sleen the thridde  as ye han herd me seye
 This yongeste  which þat wente vnto the toun
fful ofte in herte  he rolleth vp and doun
The beautee of thise floryns  newe and brighte
O lord quod he  if so were þat I myghte
Haue al this tresor  to my self allone
Ther is no man  þat lyueth vnder the trone
Of god  that sholde lyue so murye as I
And atte laste  the feend oure enemy
Putte in his thought þat he sholde poyson beye
With which  he myghte  sleen hise felawes tweye
ffor why  the feend foond hym in swich lyuynge
That he hadde leue  hem to sorwe brynge
  
ffor this was outrely  his fulle entente
To sleen hem bothe  and neuere to repente
And forth he gooth  no lenger wolde he tarie
Into the toun  vnto Apothecarie
And preyde hym  þat he hym wolde selle
Som poyson  þat he myghte hise rattes quelle
And eek ther was  a polcat in his hawe
That as he seyde  hise capons hadde yslawe
And fayn he wolde  wreke hym  if he myghte
On vermyn  þat destroyed hym by nyghte
 The Pothecarie answerde  and thou shalt haue
A thyng that al so god my soule saue
In al this world  ther is no creature
That eten or dronken hath  of this confiture
Noght but the montance of a corn of whete
That he ne shal  his lif anon forlete
Ye sterue he shal  and that in lasse while
Than thou wolt goon a paas  nat but A Mile
This poyson  is so strong and violent
 This cursed man  hath in his hond yhent
This poyson in a box  and sith he ran
Into the nexte strete  vnto a man
And borwed hym  large botels thre
And in the two  his poyson poured he
The thridde he kepte clene  for his owene drynke
ffor al the nyght he shoope hym for to swynke
In cariynge of the gold  out of that place
And whan this Riotour with sory grace
Hadde filled with wyn  hise grete botels thre  
To hise felawes  agayn repaireth he
 What nedeth it to sermone of it moore
ffor right so  as they hadde cast his deeth bifoore
Right so they han hym slayn  and that anon
And whan þat this was doon  thus spak that oon
Now lat vs sitte and drynke  and make vs merie
And afterward  we wol his body berie
  
And with that word  it happed hym par cas
To take the botel  ther the poyson was
And drank and yaf his felawe drynke also
ffor which anon  they storuen bothe two
 But certes I suppose  that Auycen
Wroot neuere in no Canon  ne in no fen
Mo wonder signes  of empoisonyng
Than hadde thise wrecches two  er hir endyng
Thus ended been  thise homycides two
And eek the false empoysonere also
 O cursed synne  of alle cursednesse
O traytours homycide o wikkednesse
O glotonye  luxurie  and hasardrye
Thou blasphemour of Crist with vileynye
And othes grete  of vsage  and of pride
Allas mankynde  how may it bitide
That to thy creatour  which þat the wroghte
And with his precious herteblood thee boghte
Thou art so fals  and so vnkynde allas
 Now goode men  god foryeue yow youre trespas
And ware yow  fro the synne of Auarice
Myn hooly pardon  may yow alle warice
So þat ye offre  nobles  or sterlynges
Or elles siluer broches  spoones  rynges
Boweth youre heed  vnder this hooly bulle
Com vp ye wyues  offreth of youre wolle
Youre names  I entre heer in my rolle anon
Into the blisse of heueue  shul ye gon
I yow assoille  by myn heigh power
Yow þat wol offre  as clene and eek as cleer
As ye were born  and lo sires thus I preche
And Ihesu crist that is oure soules leche
So graunte yow  his pardon to receyue
ffor that is best I wol yow nat deceyue
But sires  o word  forgat I in my tale
I haue Relikes  and pardon in my male
  
As faire  as any man in Engelond
Whiche were me yeuen  by the popes hond
If any of yow  wole of deuocion
Offren  and han myn Absolucion
Com forth anon  and kneleth heere adoun  
And mekely  receyueth my pardoun
Or elles  taketh pardon  as ye wende
Al newe and fressh  at euery Miles ende
So þat ye offren  alwey newe and newe
Nobles or pens  whiche þat be goode and trewe
It is an honour  to euerich that is heer
That ye mowe haue  a suffisant Pardoneer
Tassoille yow  in contree as ye ryde
ffor auentures  whiche þat may bityde
Parauenture  ther may fallen  oon or two
Doun of his hors  and breke his nekke atwo
Looke which a seuretee  is it to yow alle
That I am  in youre felaweshipe yfalle
That may assoille yow  bothe moore and lasse
Whan þat the soule  shal fro the body passe
I rede  þat oure hoost heere shal bigynne
ffor he is  moost envoluped in synne
Com forth sire hoost and offre first anon
And thou shalt kisse  my Relikes euerychon
Ye for a grote  vnbokele anon thy purs
Nay nay quod he  thanne haue I cristes curs
Lat be quod he  it shal nat be so theech
Thou woldest make me  kisse thyn olde breech
And swere  it were a relyk of a seint
Though it were  with thy fundement depeint
But by the croys  which þat seint Eleyne fond
I wolde  I hadde  thy coillons in myn hond
In stide of Relikes  or of seintuarie
Lat kutte hem of  I wol with thee hem carie
They shul be shryned  in an hogges toord
 This Pardoner answerde nat a word
  
So wrooth he was  no word ne wolde he seye
 Now quod oure hoost I wol no lenger pleye
With thee  ne with noon oother angry man
But right anon  the worthy knyght bigan
Whan þat he saugh  þat al the peple lough
Namoore of this  for it is right ynough
Sire Pardoner  be glad and myrie of cheere
And ye sir hoost þat been to me so deere
I prey yow  þat ye kisse the Pardoner
And Pardoner  I prey thee  drawe thee neer
And as we diden  lat vs laughe and pleye
Anon they kiste  and ryden forth hir weye
A Marchant whilom dwelled at Seint Denys
That riche was  for which men helde hym wys
A wyf he hadde  of excellent beautee
And compaignable  and reuelous was she
Which is a thyng that causeth more dispence
Than worth is  al the chiere and reuerence
That men hem doon  at festes and at daunces
Swiche salutacions  and contenaunces
Passen  as dooth a shadwe vp on the wal
But wo is hym  that payen moot for al
The sely housbonde  algate he moste paye
He moot vs clothe  and he moot vs arraye
Al for his owene worship richely
In which array  we daunce iolily
And if þat he noght may  par auenture
Or ellis  list no swich dispence endure
But thynketh  it is wasted  and ylost
Thanne moot another  payen for oure cost
Or lene vs gold  and that is perilous
 This noble Marchant heeld a worthy hous
ffor which  he hadde alday so greet repair
ffor his largesse  and for his wyf was fair
That wonder is  but herkneth to my tale
Amonges alle hise gestes  grete and smale
Ther was a Monk a fair man and a boold
I trowe of thritty wynter he was oold
That euere in oon  was comynge to that place
This yonge Monk  þat was so fair of face
  
Aqueynted was so  with the goode man
Sith that  hir firste knoweliche bigan
That in his hous  as famulier was he
As it possible  any freend to be
 And for as muchel  as this goode man
And eek this Monk of which þat I bigan
Were bothe two  yborn in o village
The Monk  hym claymeth  as for cosynage
And he agayn  he seith nat ones nay
But was as glad therof  as fowel of day
ffor to his herte  it was a greet plesance
Thus been they knyt with eterne alliance
And ech of hem  gan oother for tassure
Of bretherhede  whil þat hir lyf may dure
 ffree was Daun Iohn and namely of dispence  
As in that hous  and ful of diligence
To doon plesance  and also greet costage
He noght forgat to yeue the leeste page
In al the hous  but after hir degree
He yaf the lord  and sitthe al his meynee
Whan that he cam  som manere honest thyng
ffor which  they were as glad of his comyng
As fowel is fayn  whan þat the sonne vp riseth
Na moore of this as now  for it suffiseth
But so bifel  this Marchant on a day
Shoop hym  to make redy his array
Toward  the toun of Brugges for to fare
To byen there  a porcion of ware
ffor which  he hath to Parys sent anon
A Messager  and preyed hath daun Iohn
That he sholde come  to Seint Denys to pleye
With hym and with his wyf  a day or tweye
Er he to Brugges wente  in alle wise
 This noble Monk of which I yow deuyse
Hath of his Abbot as hym list licence
By cause  he was a man  of heigh prudence
  
And eek an Officer  out for to ryde
To seen hir graunges  and hire bernes wyde
And vnto Seint Denys  he comth anon
Who was so welcome  as my lord Daun Iohn
Oure deere cosyn  ful of curteisye
With hym broghte he a Iubbe of Maluesye
And eek another  ful of fyn vernage
And volatyl  as ay was his vsage
And thus  I lete hem drynke and pleye
This Marchant and this Monk a day or tweye
 The thridde day  this Marchant vp ariseth
And on hise nedes  sadly hym auyseth
And vp  in to his Countour hous gooth he
To rekene with hym self  wel may be
Of thilke yeer  how þat it with hym stood
And how þat he  despended hadde his good
And if þat he  encressed were or noon
Hise bookes  and his bagges many oon
He leith biforn hym  on his countyng bord
fful riche  was his tresor and his hord
ffor which ful faste  his Countour dore he shette
And eek he nolde  þat no man sholde hym lette
Of hise accountes  for the meene tyme
And thus he sit til it was passed pryme
 Daun Iohn was rysen  in the morwe also
And in the gardyn  walketh to and fro
And hath hise thynges seyd  ful curteisly  
 This goode wyf cam walkynge pryuely
In to the gardyn  there he walketh softe
And hym saleweth  as she hath doon ofte
A mayde child  cam in hire compaignye
Which as hir list she may gouerne and gye
ffor yet vnder the yerde was the mayde
O deere cosyn myn  daun Iohn she sayde
What eyleth yow  so rathe for to ryse
 Nece quod he  it oghte ynough suffise
  
ffyue houres for to slepe  vp on a nyght
But it were  for an old appalled wight
As been thise wedded men  þat lye and dare
As in a fourme  sit a wery hare
Were al forstraught  with houndes grete and smale
But deere Nece  why be ye so pale
I trowe certes  that oure goode man
Hath yow laboured  sith the nyght bigan
That yow were nede  to resten hastily
And with that word  he lough ful murily
And of his owene thought he wax al reed
 This faire wyf gan for to shake hir heed
And seyde thus  ye god woot al quod she
Nay nay cosyn myn  it stant nat so with me
ffor by that god  that yaf me soule and lyf
In al the Reawme of ffrance  is ther no wyf
That lasse lust hath  to that sory pley
ffor I may synge  allas and weylawey
That I was born  but to no wight quod she
Dar I nat telle  how that it stant with me
Wherfore I thynke  out of this land to wende
Or elles  of my self to make an ende
So ful am I  of drede  and eek of care
 This Monk bigan vp on this wyf to stare
And  seyde  Allas my Nece god forbede
That ye  for any sorwe  or any drede
ffordo youre self  but tel me of youre grief
Parauenture  I yow may  in youre meschief
Conseille or helpe  and therfore telleth me
All youre anoy  for it shal been secree
ffor on my porthors  I make an ooth
That neuere in my lyf  for lief ne looth
Ne shal I  of no conseil yow biwreye
 The same agayn  to yow quod she I seye
By god  and by this Porthors I yow swere
Though men me wolde  al in to pieces tere
  
Ne shal I neuere  for to goon to helle
Biwreye a word  of thyng þat ye me telle
Nat for no cosynage  ne alliance  
But verraily  for loue and affiance
Thus been they sworn  and heer vpon they kiste
And ech of hem  tolde oother what hem liste
 Cosyn quod she  if þat I hadde a space
As I haue noon  and namely in this place
Thanne wolde I telle  a legende of my lyf
What I haue suffred  sith I was a wyf
With myn housbonde  al be he of youre kyn
 Nay quod this Monk by god  and by seint Martyn
He is  na moore cosyn vnto me
Than is this lief þat hangeth on the tree
I clepe hym so  by Seint Denys of ffrance
To haue  the moore cause of Aqueyntance
Of yow  which I haue loued specially
Abouen alle wommen sikerly
This swere I yow  on my profession
Telleth youre grief  lest þat he come adoun
And hasteth yow  and gooth youre wey anon
 My deere loue quod she  o my daun Iohn
fful lief were me  this conseil for to hyde
But out it moot I may namoore abyde
Myn housbonde  is to me the worste man
That euere was  sith þat the world bigan
But sith I am a wyf it sit nat me
To tellen no wight  of oure priuetee
Neither a bedde  ne in noon oother place
God shilde  I sholde it tellen for his grace
A wyf  ne shal nat seyn of hir housbonde
But al honour  as I kan vnderstonde
Saue vn to yow  thus muche I tellen shal
As helpe me god  he is noght worth at al
In no degree  the value of a flye
But yet me greueth moost his nygardye
  
And wel ye woot þat wommen naturelly
Desiren thynges sixe  as wel as I
They wolde  that hir housbondes sholde be
Hardy and wise  and riche and therto free
And buxom vn to his wyf and fressh abedde
But by that ilke lord  that for vs bledde
ffor his honour  my self for to arraye
A sonday next I moste nedes paye
An hundred frankes  or ellis I am lorn
Yet were me leuere  that I were vnborn
Than me were doon  a sclaundre or vileynye
And if myn housbonde  eek it myghte espye
I nere but lost and therfore I yow preye
Lene me this somme  or ellis moot I deye
Daun Iohn I seye  lene me thise hundred frankes  
Pardee  I wol nat faille yow my thankes
If that yow list to doon that I yow praye
ffor at a certeyn day  I wol yow paye
And doon to yow  what plesance and seruice
That I may doon  right as yow list deuise
And but I do  god take on me vengeance
As foul  as euere hadde Genylon of ffrance
 This gentil Monk  answerde in this manere
Now trewely  myn owene lady deere
I haue quod he  on yow so greet a routhe
That I yow swere  and plighte yow my trouthe
That whan youre housbonde  is to fflaundres fare
I wol delyuere yow  out of this care
ffor I wol brynge yow  an hundred frankes
And with that word  he caughte hire by the flankes
And hire embraceth harde  and kiste hire ofte
Gooth now youre wey quod he  al stille and softe
And lat us dyne  as soone as þat ye may
ffor by my chilyndre  it is pryme of day
Gooth now  and beeth as trewe as I shal be
 Now elles  god forbede sire quod she
  
And forth she gooth  as Iolif as a pye
And bad the cookes  þat they sholde hem hye
So þat men myghte dyne  and that anon

Youre sommes  and youre bookes  and youre thynges
The deuel haue part on alle swiche rekenynges
Ye haue ynough pardee  of goddes sonde
Com doun to day  and lat youre bagges stonde
Ne be ye nat ashamed that Daun Iohn
Shal fasting al this day alenge goon
Lat vs heere a messe  and go we dyne

The curious bisynesse  that we haue

And by that lord  þat clepid is Seint Yve
Scarsly amonges xij ten shul thryue
Continuelly  lastynge vn to oure age
We may wel  make chiere  and good visage
And dryue forth the world  as it may be
And kepen  oure estaat in pryuetee
Til we be deed  or elles that we pleye
A pilgrymage  or goon out of the weye
And therfore  haue I greet necessitee  
Vp on this queynte world tauyse me
ffor eueremoore  we moote stonde in drede
Of hap and ffortune  in oure chapmanhede
 To fflaundres  wol I go  to morwe at day
And come agayn  as soone as euere I may

As be to euery wight buxom and meke
And for to kepe oure good  be curious
And honestly  gouerne wel oure hous
  
Thou hast ynough  in euery maner wise
That  to a thrifty houshold may suffise
Thee lakketh noon array  ne no vitaille
Of siluer in thy purs  shaltow nat faille
And with that word  his Countour dore he shette
And doun he gooth  no lenger wolde he lette
But hastily  a messe was ther seyd
And spedily  the tables were yleyd
And to the dyner  faste they hem spedde
And richely  this Monk  the chapman fedde
 At after dyner  daun Iohn sobrely
This Chapman took apart and priuely
He seyde hym thus  cosyn it standeth so
That wel I se  to Brugges  wol ye go
God and seint Austyn  spede yow and gyde

Gouerneth yow also  of youre diete

Bitwix vs two  nedeth no strange fare

And if þat any thyng by day or nyght
If it lye in my power  and my myght
That ye me wol comande in any wyse

 O thyng er þat ye goon  if it may be
I wolde prey yow  for to lene me
An hundred frankes  for a wyke or tweye
ffor certein beestes  þat I moste beye
To stoore with a place þat is oures

Nat for a thousand frankes a Mile way
But lat this thyng be secree  I yow preye
ffor yet to nyght  thise beestes moot I beye
And fare now wel  myn owene cosyn deere
Graunt mercy  of youre cost  and of youre cheere
  
 This noble marchant  gentilly anon
Answerde  and seyde o cosyn myn Daun Iohn
Now sikerly  this is a smal requeste  
My gold is youres  whan þat it yow leste
And nat oonly my gold  but my chaffare
Take what yow list god shilde þat ye spare
 But o thyng is  ye knowe it wel ynogh
Of Chapmen  that hir moneie is hir plogh
We may creaunce  whil we haue a name
But goldlees for to be  it is no game
Paye it agayn  whan it lith in youre ese
After my myght  ful fayn wolde I yow plese
 Thise hundred frankes  he fette hym forth anon
And priuely  he took hem to daun Iohn
No wight in al this world  wiste of this loone
Sauynge this Marchant  and daun Iohn alloone
They drynke  and speke  and rome a while and pleye
Til þat daun Iohn  rideth to his Abbeye
The morwe cam  and forth this Marchant rideth
To fflaundres ward  his prentys wel hym gydeth
Til he cam  in to Brugges murily
Now gooth this Marchant faste and bisily
Aboute his nede  and byeth and creaunceth
He neither  pleyeth at dees ne daunceth
But as a Marchant shortly for to telle
He let his lyf  and there I lete hym dwelle
The sonday next this Marchant was agon
To seint Denys  ycomen is Daun Iohn
With crowne and berde all fressh and newe yshaue
In al the hous  ther nas so litel a knaue
Ne no wight elles  þat he nas ful fayn
That my lord Daun Iohn  was come agayn
And shortly  right to the point for to gon
This faire wyf accorded with daun Iohn
That for thise hundred frankes  he sholde al nyght
Haue hire in hise armes  bolt upright
  
And this acord  parfourned was in dede
In myrthe al nyght a bisy lyf they lede
Til it was day  þat Daun Iohn wente his way
And bad the meynee  fare wel haue good day
ffor noon of hem  ne no wight in the toun
Hath of daun Iohn  right no suspecioun
And forth he rydeth  hoom to his Abbeye
Or where hym list namoore of hym I seye
This Marchant whan þat ended was the faire
To Seint Denys  he gan for to repaire
And with his wyf he maketh feeste and cheere
And telleth hire  that Chaffare is so deere
That nedes  moste he make a cheuyssance
ffor he was bounden  in a reconyssance
To paye twenty thousand sheeld anon  
ffor which  this Marchant is to Parys gon
To borwe  of certeine freendes þat he hadde
A certeyn frankes  and somme with him he ladde
And whan þat he was come  in to the toun
ffor greet chiertee  and greet affectioun
Vn to daun Iohn  he gooth hym first to pleye
Nat for to axe  or borwe of hym moneye
But for to wite  and seen of his welfare
And for to tellen hym  of his chaffare
As freendes doon  whan they been met yfeere
Daun Iohn  hym maketh feeste and murye cheere
And he hym tolde agayn  ful specially
How he hadde wel yboght and graciously
Thanked be god  al hool his marchandise
Saue þat he moste  in alle maner wise
Maken a cheuyssance  as for his beste
And thanne  he sholde been  in ioye and reste
 Daun Iohn answerde  certes I am fayn
That ye in heele  ar comen hom agayn
And if þat I were riche  as haue I blisse
Of twenty thousand sheeld  shold ye nat mysse
  
ffor ye  so kyndely  this oother day
Lente me gold  and as I kan and may
I thanke yow  by god and by seint Iame
But nathelees  I took vn to oure dame
Youre wyf  at hom  the same gold ageyn
Vpon youre bench  she woot it wel certeyn
By certeyn tokenes  that I kan yow telle
Now by youre leue  I may no lenger dwelle
Oure Abbot wole out of this toun anon
And in his compaignye  moot I goon
Grete wel oure dame  myn owene Nece sweete
And fare wel deere cosyn  til we meete
This Marchant which þat was ful war and wys
Creanced hath  and payd eek in Parys
To certeyn lumbardes  redy in hir hond
The somme of gold  and hadde of hem his bond
And hoom he gooth  murie  as a Papeiay
ffor wel he knew  he stood in swich array
That nedes moste he wynne in that viage
A thousand frankes  abouen al his costage
 His wyf ful redy  mette hym atte gate
As she was wont of oold vsage algate
And al that nyght in myrthe they bisette
ffor he was riche  and cleerly out of dette
Whan it was day  this Marchant gan embrace
His wyf  al newe  and kiste hire on hir face
And vp he gooth  and maketh it ful tough  
 Namoore quod she  by god ye haue ynough
And wantownely agayn  with hym she pleyde
 Til atte laste  this Marchant seyde
By god quod he  I am a litel wrooth
With yow my wyf  although it were me looth
And woot ye why  by god as þat I gesse
That ye han maad  a manere straungenesse
Bitwixen me  and my cosyn daun Iohn
Ye sholde han warned me  er I had gon
  
That he yow hadde  an hundred frankes payed
By redy tokene  and heeld hym yuele apayed
ffor þat I to hym spak of cheuyssance
Me semed so  as by his contenance
But nathelees  by god oure heuene kyng
I thoughte nat to axen hym no thyng
I prey thee wyf  as do namoore so
Telle me alwey  er that I fro thee go
If any dettour  hath in myn absence
Ypayed thee  lest thurgh thy necligence
I myghte hym axe  a thing that he hath payed
 This wyf was nat afered nor affrayed
But boldely she seyde  and that anon
Marie  I deffie  the false Monk  daun Iohn
I kepe nat of hise tokenes  neuer a deel
He took me certeyn gold  that woot I wee
What yuel thedam  on his Monkes snowte
ffor god it woot I wende withouten doute
That he hadde yeue it me  bycause of yow
To doon therwith  myn honour and my prow
ffor cosynage  and eek for beele cheere
That he hath had  ful ofte tymes heere
But sith I se  I stonde in this disioynt
I wol answere yow  shortly to the poynt
 Ye han mo slakkere dettours  than am I
ffor I wol paye yow  wel and redily
ffor day to day  and if so be I faille
I am youre wyf score it vpon my taille
And I shal paye  as soone as euer I may
ffor by my trouthe  I haue on myn array
And nat on wast bistowed euery deel
And for I haue  bistowed it so weel
ffor youre honour  for goddes sake I seye
As be nat wrooth  but lat vs laughe and pleye
Ye shal  my ioly body  haue to wedde
By god I wol nat paye yow but a bedde
  
fforgyue it me  myn owene spouse deere
Turne hiderward  and maketh bettre cheere
 This Marchant saugh  ther was no remedie  
And for to chide  it nere but greet folie
Sith that the thyng may nat amended be
Now wyf he seyde  and I foryeue it thee
But by thy lyf ne be namoore so large
Keepe bet oure good  that yeue I thee in charge
Thus endeth my tale  and god vs sende
Taillynge ynough  vnto oure lyues ende Amen 
Wel seyd by corpus dominus quod our Hoost
Now longe  moote thou saille by the cost
Sire gentil maister  gentil Maryneer
God yeue this Monk  a thousand last quade yeer
A ha felawes  beth ware of swiche a Iape

And in his wyues eek by Seint Austyn
Draweth no Monkes  moore vn to youre In
 But now passe ouer  and lat vs seke aboute
Who shal now  telle first of al this route
Another tale  and with that word he sayde
As curteisly  as it had ben a mayde
My lady Prioresse  by youre leue
So that I wiste  I sholde yow nat greue
I wolde demen  that ye tellen sholde
A tale next if so were that ye wolde
Now wol ye vouche sauf my lady deere
 Gladly quod she  and seyde as ye shal heere
O lord oure lord  thy name how merueillous
Is in this large world  ysprad quod she

Parfourned is  by men of dignitee
But by the mouth of children  thy bountee
Parfourned is  for on the brest soukynge
Somtyme  shewen they thyn heriynge
Wherfore in laude  as I best kan or may  
Of thee  and of the lylye flour
Which that the bar  and is a mayde alway
To telle a storie  I wol do my labour
Nat that I may  encreessen hir honour
sfor she hir self  is honour and the roote
Of bountee next hir sone  and soules boote
O mooder mayde  o mayde mooder fre
O bussh vnbrent brennynge in Moyses sighte
That rauysedest doun fro the deitee
Thurgh thyn humblesse  the goost þat in thalighte
Of whos vertu  whan he thyn herte lighte
Conceyued was  the fadres sapience
Helpe me  to telle it in thy reuerence
Lady  thy bountee  thy magnificence
Thy vertu  and thy grete humylitee
Ther may no tonge expresse  in no science
ffor somtyme lady  er men praye to thee
Thou goost biforn  of thy benyngnytee
And getest vs  thurgh lyght of thy preyere
To gyden vs  vn to thy sone so deere
  
My konnyng is so wayk o blisful queene
ffor to declare  thy grete worthynesse
That I ne may  the weighte nat susteene
But as a child  of twelf  monthe oold or lesse
That kan vnnethe  any word expresse
Right so fare I  and therfore I yow preye
Gydeth my song þat I shal of yow seye
Ther was in Asye  in a greet Citee
Amonges cristene folk  a Iewerye
Sustened  by a lord  of that contree
ffor foule vsure  and lucre of vileynye
Hateful  to Crist and to his compaignye
And thurgh the strete  men myghte ride or wende
ffor it was free  and open at eyther ende
A litel scole  of cristen folk ther stood  
Doun at the ferther ende  in which ther were
Children an heepe  ycomen of cristen blood
That lerned in that scole  yeer by yere
Swich manere doctrine  as men vsed there
This is to seyn  to syngen  and to rede
As smale children doon  in hire childhede
Among thise children  was a wydwes sone
A litel clergeon  seuen yeer of age
That day by day  to scole was his wone
And eek also  where as he saugh thymage
Of Cristes mooder he hadde in vsage
As hym was taught to knele adoun and seye
His Aue Marie  as he goth by the weye
  
Thus hath this wydwe  hir litel sone ytaught
Oure blisful lady cristes mooder deere
To worshipe ay  and he forgate it naught
ffor sely child  wol alday soone leere
But ay  whan I remembre on this mateere
Seint Nicholas  stant euere in my presence
ffor he so yong to Crist dide reuerence
This litel child his litel book lernynge
As he sat in the scole  at his prymer
He  Alma redemptoris  herde synge
As children  lerned hire Anthiphoner
And as he dorste  he drough hym ner and ner
And herkned ay  the wordes and the noote
Til he the firste vers  koude al by rote
Noght wiste he  what this latyn was to seye
ffor he so yong and tendre was of age
But on a day  his felawe gan he preye
Texpounden hym this song in his langage
Or telle hym  why this song was in vsage
This preyde he hym  to construe and declare
fful often tyme  vpon hise knowes bare
His felawe  which that elder was than he
Answerde hym thus  this song I haue herd seye
Was maked  of oure blisful lady free
Hire to salue  and eek hire for to preye
To been oure help  and socour whan we deye
I kan na moore  expounde in this mateere
I lerne song I kan but smal grammeere
 And is this song maked in reuerence  
Of cristes mooder seyde  this Innocent
Now certes  I wol do my diligence
To konne it al  er Cristemasse is went
  
Though þat  I for my prymer shal be shent
And shal be beten  thries in an houre
I wol it konne  oure lady for to honoure
His felawe  taughte hym homward priuely
ffro day to day  til he koude it by rote
And thanne  he song it wel and boldely
ffro word to word to word acordynge with the note
Twies a day  it passed thurgh his throte
To scoleward and homward whan he wente
On cristes mooder  set was his entente
 As I haue seyd  thurgh out the Iuerie
This litel child  as he cam to and fro
fful murily  wolde he synge and crie
O Alma redemptoris  euere mo
The swetnesse  his herte perced so
Of cristes mooder  that to hire to preye
He kan nat stynte  of syngyng by the weye
Ovre firste foo  the serpent Sathanas
That hath  in Iues herte his waspes nest
Vp swal  and seide  o hebrayk peple allas
Is this to yow  a thyng þat is honest
That swich a boy  shal walken as hym lest
In youre despit and synge of swich sentence
Which is  agayn oure lawes reuerence
ffro thennes forth  the Iues han conspired
This Innocent out of this world to chace
An homycide  ther to  han they hyred
That in an Aleye  hadde a priuee place
And as the child  gan forby for to pace
This cursed Iew hym hente  and heeld hym faste
And kitte his throte  and in a pit hym caste
  
I seye  that in a wardrobe  they hym threwe
Where as thise Iewes  purgen hire entraille
O cursed folk  of Herodes al newe
What may youre yuel entente yow auaille
Mordre wol out certeyn  it wol nat faille
And namely  ther thonour of god shal sprede
The blood out crieth  on youre cursed dede
 O martir  sowded to virginitee  
Now maystow syngen  folwynge euere in oon
The white lamb celestial quod she
Of which  the grete Euaungelist Seint Iohn
In Pathmos wroot which seith  þat they þat goon
Biforn this lamb  and synge a song al newe
That neuere fleshly  wommen they ne knewe
 This poure wydwe  awaiteth al that nyght
After hir litel child  but he cam noght
ffor which as soone  as it was dayes lyght
With face pale of drede  and bisy thoght
She hath at scole  and elles where hym soght
Til finally  she gan so fer espie
That he  last seyn was in the Iuerie
With moodres pitee  in hir brest enclosed
She gooth  as she were half  out of hir mynde
To euery place  where she hath supposed
By liklihede  hir litel child to fynde
And euere  on Cristes mooder meeke and kynde
She cride  and atte laste  thus she wroghte
Among the cursed Iues  she hym soghte
She frayneth  and she preyeth pitously
To euery Iew  þat dwelte in thilke place
To telle hire  if hir child  wente oght forby
They seyde nay  but Ihesu of his grace
  
Yaf in hir thoght inwith a litel space
That in that place  after hir sone she cryde
Where he was casten  in a pit bisyde
O grete god  that parfournest thy laude
By mouth of Innocentz  lo heere thy myght
This gemme of chastite  this Emeraude
And eek of martirdom  the Ruby bright
Ther he with throte ykoruen lay vpright
He Alma redemptoris  gan to synge
So loude  þat al the place gan to rynge
 The cristene folk  that thurgh the strete wente
In coomen  for to wondre vp on this thyng
And hastily  they for the Prouost sente
He cam anon  with outen tariyng
And herieth Crist that is of heuene kyng
And eek his mooder  honour of mankynde
And after that  the Iewes leet he bynde
 This child  with pitous lamentacion  
Vp taken was  syngynge his song alway
And with honour of greet procession
They carien hym  vn to the nexte Abbay
His mooder swownynge  by his beere lay
Vnnethe  myghte the peple þat was theere
This newe Rachel  brynge fro his beere
 With torment and with shameful deeth echon
This Prouost dooth the Iewes for to sterue
That of this mordre wiste  and that anon
He nolde  no swich cursednesse obserue
Yuele shal he haue  þat yuele wol deserue
Therfore  with wilde hors  he dide hem drawe
And after that he heng hem by the lawe
  
 Vp on this beere  ay lith this Innocent
Biforn the chief Auter  whil the masse laste
And after that the Abbot with his Couent
Han sped hem  for to burien hym ful faste
And whan they  hooly water on hym caste
Yet spak this child  whan spreynd was hooly water
And song O Alma redemptoris mater
 This Abbot which þat was an hooly man
As Monkes been  or elles oghte be
This yonge child  to coniure he bigan
And seyde o deere child I halsen thee
In vertu  of the hooly Trinitee
Tel me  what is thy cause  for to synge
Sith þat thy throte is kut to my semynge
 My throte is kut vn to my nekke boon
Seyde this child and as by wey of kynde
I sholde haue dyed  ye longe tyme agon
But Ihesu crist  as ye in bookes fynde
Wil þat his glorie  laste  and be in mynde
And for the worship  of his mooder deere
Yet may I synge  O Alma  loude and cleere
 This welle of mercy Cristes mooder sweete
I loued alwey  as after my konnynge
And whan þat I my lyf  sholde forlete
To me she cam  and bad me for to synge
This Anthephen  verraily  in my deyynge
As ye han herd  and whan þat I hadde songe
Me thoughte  she leyde a greyn vp on my tonge
Wherfore I synge  and synge I moot certeyn  
In honour  of that blisful mayden free
Til fro my tonge  of taken is the greyn
And afterward  thus seyde she to me
  
My litel child  now wol I fecche thee
Whan þat the greyn  is fro thy tonge ytake
Be nat agast I wol thee nat forsake
 This hooly Monk this Abbot hym meene I
His tonge out caughte  and took awey the greyn
And he yaf vp the goost ful softely
And whan this Abbot hadde this wonder seyn
Hise salte teeris  trikled doun as reyn
And gruf he fil  al plat vp on the grounde
And stille he lay  as he had leyn ybounde
The Couent eek  lay on the pauement
Wepynge  and heryen cristes mooder deere
And after that  they ryse and forth been went
And tooken awey  this martir from his beere
And in a temple  of Marbul stones cleere
Enclosen they  his litel body sweete
Ther he is now  god leue us alle for to meete
 O yonge Hugh of Lyncoln slayn also
With cursed Iewes  as it is notable
ffor it is  but a litel while ago
Preye eek  for vs  we synful folk vnstable
That of his mercy  god so merciable
On vs  his grete mercy multiplie
ffor reuerence  of his mooder Marie Amen 
WHan seyd was al this miracle  euery man
As sobre was  that wonder was to se
Til that oure hoost Iapen to bigan
And thanne at erst he looked vp on me
And seyde thus  what man artow quod he
Thou lookest as thou woldest fynde an hare
ffor euere  vp on the ground  I se thee stare
Approche neer  and looke vp murily  
Now war yow sires  and lat this man haue place
He in the waast is shape  as wel as I
This were a popet in an Arm tenbrace
ffor any womman smal  and fair of face
He semeth eluyssh  by his contenance
ffor vn to no wight  dooth he daliance
Sey now somwhat syn oother folk han sayd
Telle vs a tale  of myrthe  and that anon
Hoost quod I  ne beth nat yuele apayd
ffor oother tale  certes kan I noon
But of a rym  I lerned longe agoon
Ye that is good quod he  now shul ye heere
Som deyntee thyng me thynketh by his cheere
Listeth lordes in good entent
And I wol telle verrayment
Of myrthe and of solas
Al of a knyght  was fair and gent
In bataille  and in tourneyment
His name was sire Thopas
 Yborn he was  in fer contree
In flaundres  al biyonde the see
At Poperyng in the place
His fader was  a man ful free
And lord he was  of that contree
As it was goddes grace
 Sire Thopas  wax a doghty swayn
Whit was his face as Payndemayn
Hise lippes rede as rose
His rode is lyk  scarlet in grayn
And I yow telle  in good certayn
He hadde  a semely nose
 His heer  his berd  was lyk saffroun
That to his girdel raughte adoun
Hise shoos of Cordewane
Of Brugges  were his hosen broun
His Robe  was of Syklatoun
That coste many a Iane
  
 He koude hunte  at wilde deer
And ride an haukyng for Riuer
With grey goshauk on honde
Therto he was  a good Archeer
Of wrastlyng was ther noon his peer
Ther any Ram shal stonde
 fful many a mayde  bright in bour
They moorne for hym paramour
Whan hem were bet to slepe
But he was chaast and no lechour
And sweete as is the Brembul flour
That bereth the rede hepe
And so bifel vp on a day
ffor sothe  as I yow telle may
Sire Thopas  wolde out ride
He worth  vpon his steede gray
And in his hand a launcegay
A long swerd  by his side
 He priketh  thurgh a fair forest  
Ther Inne  is many a wilde best
Ye bothe bukke and hare
And as he priketh North and Est
I telle it yow  hym hadde almest
Bitidde  a sory care
 Ther spryngen herbes  grete and smale
The lycorys and Cetewale
And many a clowe gylofre
And Notemuge  to putte in Ale
Wheither it be moyste  or stale
Or for to leye in cofre
  
 The briddes synge  it is no nay
The sparhauk and the papeiay
That ioye it was to heere
The thrustelcok  made eek hir lay
The wodedowue  vp on a spray
She sang ful loude and cleere
 Sire Thopas fil in loue longynge
Al whan he herde  the thrustel synge
And pryked  as he were wood
His faire steede in his prikynge
So swatte  þat men myghte him wrynge
His sydes  were al blood
 Sire Thopas eek  so wery was
ffor prikyng on the softe gras
So fiers was his corage
That doun he leyde him in that plas
To make his steede som solas
And yaf hym good forage
 O seinte Marie benedicite
What eyleth  this loue at me
To bynde me so soore
Me dremed  al this nyght pardee
An elf queene  shal my lemman be
And slepe vnder my goore
 An Elf queene  wol I loue ywis
ffor in this world  no womman is
Worthy to be my make
In towne
 Alle othere wommen I forsake
And to an Elf queene I me take
By dale and eek by downe
  
 In to his sadel  he clamb anon
And priketh ouer stile and stoon
An Elf queene for tespye
Til he so longe  hadde riden and goon
That he foond  in a pryue woon
The contree of ffairye
so wilde
ffor in that contree was ther noon
    
Neither wyf ne childe
 Til þat ther cam a greet geaunt
His name was  sire Olifaunt
A perilous man of dede
He seyde child by Termagaunt 
But if thou prike  out of myn haunt
Anon I sle thy steede
with mace
 Heere is  the queene of ffairye
With harpe  and pipe and symphonye
Dwellynge in this place
 The child seyde  Al so moote I thee
Tomorwe  wol I meete with thee
Whan I haue myn Armoure
 And yet I hope  par ma fay
That thou shalt with this launcegay
Abyen it ful sowre
Thy mawe
Thyn hauberk  shal I percen  if I may
Er it be fully pryme of day
ffor heere thow shalt be slawe
  
 Sire Thopas  drow abak ful faste
This geant at hym stones caste
Out of a fel staf slynge
 But faire escapeth sire Thopas
And al it was thurgh goddes gras
And thurgh his fair berynge
Yet listeth  lordes  to my tale  
Murier than the Nightyngale
I wol yow rowne
How sir Thopas  with sydes smale
Prikyng ouer hill and dale
Is comen agayn to towne
 His murie men  comanded he
To make hym  bothe game and glee
ffor nedes  moste he fighte
With a geaunt with heuedes three
ffor paramour and Iolitee
Of oon  that shoon ful brighte
 Do come he seyde  my Mynstrales
And geestours  for to tellen tales
Anon in myn Armynge
Of Romances  that been Roiales
Of Popes  and of Cardinales
And eek of loue likynge
 They sette hym first sweete wyn
And Mede eek in a Mazelyn
And Roial spicerye
And Gyngebreed  þat was ful fyn
And lycorys and eek Comyn
With sugre þat is so trye
  
 He dide  next his white leere
Of clooth of lake  fyn and cleere
A breech  and eek a sherte
And next his sherte an Aketon
And ouer that an haubergeon
ffor percynge of his herte
 And ouer that  a fyn hawberk
Was al ywroght of Iewes werk
fful strong it was of plate
And ouer that his cote Armour
As whit as is  a lilye flour
In which  he wol debate
 His sheeld  was al  of gold so reed
And ther Inne  was a bores heed
A Charbocle bisyde
And there he swoor  on ale and breed
How þat the geaunt shal be deed
Bityde what bityde
 Hise Iambeux were of quyrboilly
His swerdes shethe of Yuory
His helm of laton bright
His sadel was of Rewel boon
His brydel  as the sonne shoon
Or as the moone light
 His spere it was  of fyn Ciprees
That bodeth werre  and no thyng pees
The heed  ful sharpe ygrounde
 His steede was  al dappull gray
It gooth an Ambil in the way
fful softely and rounde
  
In londe
 Loo lordes myne  heere is a fit
If ye wol any moore of it
To telle it  wol I fonde
NOw holde youre mouth par charitee
Bothe knyght and lady free
And herkneth to my spelle
 Of batailles  and of Chiualry
And of ladyes  loue drury
Anon I wol yow telle
 Men speken of Romances of prys
Of Hornchild  and of Ypotys
Of Beves and of sir Gy
Of sir lybeux and pleyn damour
But sir Thopas  he bereth the flour
Of Roial Chiualry
 His goode Steede  al he bistrood
And forth  vpon his wey he rood
As sparcle  out of the bronde
 Vp on his Creest He bar a tour  
And ther Inne  stiked a lilie flour
God shilde his cors fro shonde
 And for he was  a knyght Auntrous
He nolde slepen  in noon hous
But liggen in his hoode
 His brighte helm  was his wonger
And by hym  baiteth his dextrer
Of herbes fyne and goode
  
 Hym self  drank water of the well
As dide the knyght sire Percyuell
So worly vnder wede
 Til on a day

Na moore of this  for goddes dignitee
Quod oure hoost for thou makest me
So wery  of thy verray lewednesse
That also wisly  god my soule blesse
Min eres aken  of thy drasty speche
Now swich a Rym  the deuel I biteche
This may wel  be Rym dogerel quod he
 Why so quod I  why wiltow lette me
Moore of my tale  than another man
Syn that it is  the beste tale I kan
 By god quod he  for pleynly at a word
Thy drasty rymyng  is nat worth a toord
Thou doost noght elles  but despendest tyme
Sire at o word  thou shalt no lenger ryme
Lat se  wher thou kanst tellen aught in geeste
Or telle in prose  somwhat at the leeste
In which ther be som murthe  or som doctryne
 Gladly quod I  by goddes sweete pyne
I wol yow telle  a litel thyng in prose
That oghte liken yow  as I suppose
Or elles certes  ye been to daungerous
It is a moral tale vertuous
Al be it take somtyme  in sondry wyse
Of sondry folk as I shal yow deuyse
 As thus  ye woot þat euery Euaungelist
That telleth vs  the peyne of Ihesu crist
Ne seith nat alle thyng as his felawe dooth
But nathelees  hir sentence is al sooth
And alle acorden  as in hire sentence
Al be ther  in hir tellyng difference

Whan they  his pitous passioun expresse
I meene  of Mark Mathew  Luc and Iohn
But doutelees  hir sentence is all oon
 Therfore lordynges alle  I yow biseche  
If þat yow thynke  I varie as in my speche
As thus  though that I telle som what moore
Of prouerbes  than ye han herd bifoore
Comprehended  in this litel tretys heere
To enforce with  theffect of my mateere
And though I  nat the same wordes seye
As ye han herd  yet to yow alle I preye
Blameth me nat for as in my sentence
Shul ye  nowher  fynden difference
ffro the sentence  of this tretys lyte
After the which  this murye tale I write
And therfore  herkneth  what þat I shal seye
And lat me tellen  al my tale I preye
Whan ended  was my tale  of Melibee
And of Prudence  and hire benignytee
Oure hoost seyde  as I am feithful man
And by that precious corpus Madrian
I hadde leuere  than a barel ale
That good lief my wyf  hadde herd this tale
She nys no thyng  of swich pacience
As was this Melibeus wyf Prudence
By goddes bones  whan I bete my knaues
She bryngeth me forth  the grete clobbed staues
And crieth  slee the dogges euerichoon
And brek hem  bothe bak and euery boon
 And if that any neighebore of myne
Wol nat in chirche  to my wyf enclyne
Or be so hardy  to hire to trespace
Whan she comth   she rampeth in my face
And crieth  false coward  wrek thy wyf
By corpus bones  I wol haue thy knyf
And thou shalt haue my distaf and go spynne
ffro day to nyght  right thus she wol bigynne
Allas she seith  that euere þat I was shape
To wedden a Milksope  or a coward ape
That wol been ouerlad with euery wight
Thou darst nat stonden by thy wyues right
 This is my lif but if that I wol fighte
And out at dore  anon I moot me dighte
Or elles I am but lost but if that I
Be lik a wilde leon foolhardy
I woot wel  she wol do me slee som day
Som neighebore  and thanne go my way
ffor I am perilous  with knyf in honde
Al be it that I dar hire nat withstonde
  
ffor she is  byg in Armes by my feith
That shal he fynde  þat hire mysdooth or seith
But lat vs passe awey  fro this mateere
 My lord the Monk quod he  be myrie of cheere
ffor ye shul telle a tale trewely
Loo Rouchestre  stant heer faste by
Ryde forth myn owene lord  brek nat oure game
But by my trouthe  I knowe nat youre name
Wher shal I calle yow  my lord daun Iohn
Or daun Thomas  or elles daun Albon
Of what hous be ye  by youre fader kyn
I vowe to god  thou hast a ful fair skyn
It is a gentil pasture  ther thow goost  
Thou art nat lyk a penant or a goost
Vpon my feith  thou art som Officer
Som worthy sexteyn  or som Celerer
ffor by my fader soule  as to my doom
Thou art a maister  whan thou art at hoom
No poure cloystrer ne no Novys
But a gouernour  wily and wys
And therwithal  of brawnes and of bones
A wel farynge persone  for the nones
I pray to god  yeue hym confusioun
That first thee broghte  vnto Religioun
Thou woldest han been  a tredefowel aright
Haddestow  as greet a leeue  as thou hast myght
To parfourne al thy lust in engendrure
Thou haddest bigeten  ful many a creature
Allas  why werestow  so wyd a Cope
God yeue me sorwe  but and I were a pope
Nat oonly thou  but euery myghty man
Though he were shorn  ful hye vpon his pan
Sholde haue a wyf  for al the world is lorn
Religioun  hath take vp al the corn
Of tredyng and we borel men been shrympes
Of fieble trees  ther comen wrecched ympes
  
    
    
This maketh  that oure wyues wole assaye
Religious folk for ye mowe bettre paye
Of Venus paiementz  than mowe we
God woot no lussheburgh payen ye
But be nat wrooth  my lord for þat I pleye
fful ofte in game  a sooth I haue herd seye
 This worthy Monk  took al in pacience
And seyde I wol doon al my diligence
As fer as sowneth  into honestee
To telle yow a tale  or two  or three
And if yow list to herkne hyderward
I wol  seyn the lyf  of seint Edward
Or ellis  first Tragedies wol I telle
Of whiche I haue an hundred in my Celle
 Tragedie is to seyn  a certeyn storie
As olde bookes  maken vs memorie
Of hym  that stood  in greet prosperitee
And is yfallen  out of heigh degree
In to myserie  and endeth wrecchedly
And they ben versified communely
Of vj feet which men clepen Exametron
In prose eek  been endited many oon
And eek in meetre  in many a sondry wyse
Lo  this declaryng oghte ynogh suffise
Now herkneth  if yow liketh for to heere  
But first  I yow biseeke  in this mateere
Though I by ordre  telle nat thise thynges
Be it of Popes  Emperours  or kynges
After hir ages  as men writen fynde
But tellen hem  som bifore and som bihynde
As it now comth  vnto my remembraunce
Haue me excused of min ignoraunce
Iwol biwaille  in manere of Tragedie
The harm of hem  that stoode in heigh degree
And fillen so  that ther nas no remedie
To brynge hem  out of hir aduersitee
ffor certein  whan þat ffortune list to flee
Ther may no man  the cours of hire withholde
Lat no man truste  on blynd prosperitee
Be war of thise ensamples  trewe and olde
AT lucifer  though  he an Angel were
And nat a man  at hym wol I bigynne
ffor though ffortune  may noon Angel dere
ffrom heigh degree  yet fel he for his synne
Doun in to helle  where he yet is Inne
O Lucifer brightest  of Angels alle
Now artow sathanas  þat mayst nat twynne
Out of miserie  in which þat thou art falle
Loo Adam  in the feeld of Damyssene
With goddes owene fynger wroght was he
And nat bigeten  of mannes sperme vnclene
And welte all Paradys  sauynge o tree
Hadde neuere worldly man so heigh degree
As Adam  til he for mysgouernance
Was dryuen  out of hys hye prosperitee
To labour and to helle  and to meschance

Loo Sampson  which that was Annunciat
By Angel  longe er his Natiuitee
And was  to god almyghty consecrat
And stood in noblesse  whil he myghte see
Was neuere  swich another as was hee
To speke of strengthe  and therwith hardynesse
But to hise wyues  toolde he his secree
Thurgh which  he slow hym self  for wrecchednesse
Sampson  this noble almyghty Champion  
Withouten wepene  saue his handes tweyne
He slow  and al torente the leon
Toward his weddyng walkynge by the weye
His false wyf  koude hym so plese and preye
Til she his conseil knew  and she vntrewe
Vnto hise foos  his conseil gan biwreye
And hym forsook and took another newe
Thre hundred foxes  took Sampson for Ire
And alle hir tayles  he togydre bond
And sette the foxes tayles  alle on fire
ffor he  on euery tayl  had knyt a brond
And they brende  alle the cornes in that lond
And alle hire Olyueres  and vynes eke
A thousand men  he slow eek with his hond
And hadde no wepene  but an Asses cheke
Whan they were slayn  so thursted hym  that he
Was wel ny lorn  for which he gan to preye
That god wolde  on his peyne han som pitee
And sende hym drynke  or elles moste he deye
And of this asses cheke  that was dreye
Out of a wang tooth  sprang anon a welle
Of which he drank anon  shortly to seye
Thus heelpe hym god  as Iudicum can telle
  
By verray force  at Gazan  on a nyght
Maugree Philistiens of that Citee
The gates of the toun  he hath vp plyght
And on his bak ycaryed hem hath hee
Hye on an hill  þat men myghte hem see
O noble almyghty Sampson  lief and deere
Had thou nat toold  to wommen thy secree
In all this world  ne hadde been thy peere
This Sampson  neuere Ciser drank ne wyn
Ne on his heed  cam rasour noon ne sheere
By precept of the Messager diuyn
ffor alle hise strengthes  in hise heeres weere
And fully twenty wynter yeer by yeere
He  hadde of Israel the gouernance
But soone  shal he wepe many a teere
ffor wommen  shal hym bryngen to meschance
Vnto his lemman Dalida he tolde
That in hise heeris  al his strengthe lay
And falsly to hise foomen  she hym solde
 And slepynge in hir barm  vpon a day  
She made to clippe  or shere  hise heres away
And made hise foomen  al this craft espyen
And whan þat they  hym foond in this array
They bounde hym faste  and putten out hise eyen
But er his heer were clipped or yshaue
Ther was no boond  with which men myghte him bynde
But now is he  in prison in a Caue
Where as they made hym  at the Queerne grynde
O noble Sampson  strongest of mankynde
O whilom  Iuge in glorie and in richesse
Now maystow wepen  with thyne eyen blynde
Sith thou fro wele  art falle in wrecchednesse
  
The ende of this caytyf was as I shal seye
Hise foomen  made a feeste vpon a day
And made hym as a fool  biforn hem pleye
And this was  in a temple of greet array
But atte laste  he made a foul affray
ffor he  the pilers shook  and made hem falle
And doun fil Temple and al  and ther it lay
And slow hym self  and eek his foomen alle
This is to seyn the Prynces euerichoon
And eek  thre thousand bodyes were ther slayn
With fallynge  of the grete Temple of stoon
Of Sampson  now wol I na moore sayn
Beth war  by this ensample oold and playn
That no men  telle hir conseil til hir wyues
Of swich thyng as they wolde han secree fayn
If þat it touche  hir lymes or hir lyues
Off Hercules  the souereyn Conquerour
Syngen hise werkes  laude and heigh renoun
ffor in his tyme  of strengthe he was the flour
He slow  and rafte the skyn of the leoun
He of Centauros  leyde the boost adoun
He Arpies slow  the crueel bryddes felle
He golden Apples  refte of the dragoun
He drow out Cerberus  the hound of helle
He slow the crueel tyrant Busirus
And made his hors  to frete hym flessh and boon
He slow  the firy serpent venymus
Of Acheloys hornes two  he brak oon
And he slow Cacus  in a Caue of stoon
He slowthe geant Antheus the stronge
He slow the grisly boor  and that anon  
And bar the heuene  on his nekke longe
  
Was neuere wight sith that this world bigan
That slow so manye Monstres  as dide he
Thurghout this wyde world  his name ran
What for his strengthe  and for his heigh bountee
And euery Reawme  wente he for to see
He was so stroong þat no man myghte hym lette
At bothe the worldes endes  seith Trophee
In stide of boundes  he a pileer sette
A lemman hadde  this noble Champion
That highte Dianira  fressh as May
And as thise clerkes  maken mention
She hath hym sent a sherte fressh and gay
Allas this sherte  allas and weylaway
Euenymed was  so subtilly withalle
That er þat he  had wered it half a day
It made his flessh  al from hise bones falle
But nathelees  somme clerkes hire excusen
By oon þat highte Nessus that it maked
Be as be may  I wol hire noght accusen
But on his bak this sherte he wered al naked
Til þat his flessh  was for the venym blaked
And whan he saugh  noon oother remedye
In hoote coles  he hath hym seluen raked
ffor with no venym deigned hym to dye
Thus starf  this worthy  myghty Hercules
Lo  who may truste  on ffortune any throwe
ffor hym þat folweth  al this world of prees
Er he be war  is ofte yleyd ful lowe
fful wys is he  that kan hym seluen knowe
Beth war  for whan that ffortune list to glose
Thanne wayteth she  her man to ouerthrowe
By swich a wey  as he wolde leest suppose

The myghty trone  the precious tresor
The glorious ceptre  and Roial magestee
That hadde the kyng Nabugodonosor
With tonge  vnnethe may discryued bee
He twyes  wan Ierusalem the Citee
The vessel of the temple  he with hym ladde
At Babiloigne  was his souereyn see
In which his glorie  and his delit he hadde
The faireste children  of the blood Roial  
Of Israel  he leet do gelde anoon
And maked ech of hem  to been his thral
Amonges othere  Daniel was oon
That was the wiseste child of euerychon
ffor he  the dremes of the kyng expowned
Where as in Chaldeye  clerk ne was ther noon
That wiste  to what fyn  hise dremes sowned
This proude kyng leet maken a statue of gold
Sixty cubites long and seuene in brede
The which ymage  he bothe yonge and oold
Comanded to loute  and haue in drede
Or in a ffourneys  ful of flambes rede
He shal be brent that wolde noght obeye
But neuere wolde assente  to that dede
Daniel  ne hise yonge felawes tweye
This kyng of kynges  proud was and elaat
He wende  þat god that sit in magestee
Ne myghte  hym nat bireue of his estaat
But sodeynly  he loste his dignytee
And lyk a beest  hym semed for to bee
And eet hey as an Oxe  and lay ther oute
In reyn  with wilde beestes walked hee
Til certein tyme  was ycome aboute
  
And lik an Egles fetheres  wax his heres
Hise nayles  lyk a briddes clawes weere
Til god relessed hym  a certeyn yeres
And yaf hym wit  and thanne with many a teere
He thanked god  and euere his lyf in feere
Was he  to doon amys  or moore trespace
And til that tyme  he leyd was on his beere
He knew  that god was  ful of myght and grace
His sone  which that highte Balthasar
That heeld the regne  after his fader day
He by his fader  koude noght be war
ffor proud he was  of herte and of array
And eek  an ydolastre  he was ay
His hye estaat assured hym in pryde
But ffortune  caste hym doun  and ther he lay
And sodeynly  his regne gan diuide
A feeste he made  vnto hise lordes alle
Vpon a tyme  and bad hem blithe bee
And thanne  hise Officers gan he calle
Gooth bryngeth forth  the vessels quod he  
Whiche that my fader  in his prosperitee
Out of the temple  of Ierusalem birafte
And to oure hye goddes  thanke we
Of honour  that oure eldres with us lafte
Hys wyf hise lordes  and hise concubynes
Ay dronken  whil hire Appetites laste
Out of thise noble vessels  sondry wynes
And on a wal  this kyng hise eyen caste
And saugh an hand Armlees  þat wroot ful fast
ffor feere of which  he quook and siked soore
This hand  that Balthasar so soore agaste
Wroot Mane techel phares  and na moore
  
In al that land  Magicien was noon
That koude expounde  what this lettre mente
But Daniel  expowned it anon
And seyde kyng god to thy fader sente
Glorie and honour  regne  tresour  rente
And he was proud  and nothyng god ne dradde
And therfore  god greet wreche vpon hym sente
And hym birafte  the regne þat he hadde
He was out cast of mannes compaignye
With asses  was his habitacioun
And eet hey as a beest in weet and drye
Til that he knew  by grace and by resoun
That god of heuene  hath domynacioun
Ouer euery regne  and euery creature
And thanne  hadde god of hym compassioun
And hym restored  his regne and his figure
Eek  thou that art his sone  art proud also
And knowest alle thise thynges verraily
And art rebel to god  and art his foo
Thou drank eek  of hise vessels boldely
Thy wyf eek and thy wenches synfully
Dronke of the same vessels  sondry wynys
And heryest false goddes cursedly
Therfore to thee  yshapen ful greet pyne ys
This hand was sent from god  that on the wal
Wroot Mane techel phares  truste me
Thy regne is doon  thou weyest noght at al
Dyuyded is thy regne  and it shal be
To Medes and to Perses  quod he
And thilke same nyght this kyng was slawe
And Darius  occupieth his degree  
Thogh he therto  hadde neither right ne lawe
  
Lordynges  ensample  heerby may ye take
How that in lordshipe  is no sikernesse
ffor whan ffortune wole a man forsake
She bereth awey  his regne and his richesse
And eek hise freendes  bothe moore and lesse
ffor what man  þat hath freendes  thurgh ffortune
Mishape  wol maken hem enemys as I gesse
This prouerbe  is ful sooth and ful commune
CEnobia  of Palymerie Queene
As writen Persiens  of hir noblesse
So worthy was in Armes  and so keene
That no wight passed hire in hardynesse
Ne in lynage  nor in oother gentillesse
Of kynges blood of Perce  is she descended
I seye nat that she hadde moost fairnesse
But of hire shape  she myghte nat been amended
ffrom hire childhede  I fynde that she fledde
Office of wommen  and to wode she went
And many a wilde hertes blood she shedde
With arwes brode  that she to hem sente
She was so swift  þat she anon hem hente
And whan þat she was elder  she wolde kille
Leons  leopardes  and Beres al torente
And in hir Armes  weelde hem at hir wille
She dorste  wilde beestes dennes seke
And rennen in the montaignes al the nyght
And slepen vnder the bussh  and she koude eke
Wrastlen  by verray force  and verray myght
With any yong man  were he neuer so wight
Ther myghte no thyng in hir Armes stonde
She kepte hir maydenhod  from euery wight
To no man  deigned hire for to be bonde
  
But atte laste  hir freendes han hire maried
To Onedake  a Prynce of that contree
Al were it so  that she hem longe taried
And ye shul vnderstonde  how that he
Hadde swiche fantasies  as hadde she
But nathelees  whan they were knyt infeere
They lyued  in ioye  and in felicitee
ffor ech of hem  hadde oother lief and deere
Saue o thyng that she wolde neuere assente  
By no wey  that he sholde by hire lye
But ones  for it was hir pleyn entente
To haue a child  the world to multiplye
And also soone  as þat she myghte espye
That she was nat with childe  with that dede
Thanne wolde she suffre hym  doon his fantasye
Eft soone  and nat but oones out of drede
And if she were with childe  at thilke cast
Na moore  sholde he pleyen thilke game
Til fully  fourty dayes  weren past
Thanne wolde she ones  suffre hym do the same
Al were this Onedake  wilde or tame
He gat na moore of hire  for thus she seyde
It was to wyues  lecherie and shame
In oother caas  if þat men with hem pleyde
Two sones  by Onedake hadde she
The whiche she kepte  in vertu and lettrure
But now  vnto oure tale  turne we
I seye  so worshipful a creature
And wys therwith  and large with mesure
So penyble in the werre  and curteis eke
Ne moore labour  myghte in werre endure
Was noon  though al this world men wolde seke
  
Hir riche array  ne myghte nat be told
As wel in vessel  as in hire clothyng
She was al clad  in perree and in gold
And eek  she lafte noght  for noon huntyng
To haue of sondry tonges  ful knowyng
Whan þat she leyser hadde  and for to entende
To lerne bookes  was al hire likyng
How she in vertu  myghte hir lyf dispende
And shortly  of this proces for to trete
So doghty was hir housbonde and eek she
That they conquered  manye regnes grete
In the Orient with many a faire Citee
Apertenaunt vnto the magestee
Of Rome  and with strong hond held hem ful faste
Ne neuere myghte  hir foo men doon hem flee
Ay  whil that Onedakes dayes laste
Hir batailles  who so list hem for to rede
Agayn Sapor the kyng and othere mo
And how al this proces  fil in dede
Why she conquered  and what title therto  
And after of hir meschief and hire wo
How þat she was  biseged and ytake
Lat hym  vnto my maister Petrak go
That writ ynough of this I vndertake
Whan Onedake was deed  she myghtily
The regnes heeld  and with hire propre hond
Agayn hir foos  she faught so cruelly
That ther nas kyng ne prynce in al that lond
That he nas glad  if he that grace fond
That she ne wolde  vpon his lond werreye
With hire  they made alliance by bond
To been in pees  and lete hire ride and pleye
  
The Emperour of Rome Claudius
Ne hym bifore  the Romayn Galien
Ne dorste neuere  been so corageus
Ne noon Ermyn  ne noon Egipcien
Ne Surrien  ne noon Arabyen
WithInne the feeldes  that dorste with hire fighte
Lest that she wolde  hem with hir handes slen
Or with hir meignee  putten hem to flighte
In kynges habit  wente hir sones two
As heires  of hir fadres regnes alle
And hermanno  and Thymalao
Hir names were  as Persiens hem calle
But ay ffortune  hath in hire hony galle
This myghty queene  may no while endure
ffortune  out of hir regne made hire falle
To wrecchednesse  and to mysauenture
Aurelian  whan that the gouernaunce
Of Rome  cam into hise handes tweye
He shoope  vpon this queene to doon vengeaunce
And with hise legions  he took his weye
Toward Cenobie  and shortly for to seye
He made hire flee  and atte last hire hente
And fettred hire  and eek hire children tweye
And wan the land  and hoom to Rome he wente
Amonges othere thynges  that he wan
Hir Chaar þat was with gold wroght and perree
This grete Romayn  this Aurelian
Hath with hym lad  for that men sholde it see
Biforn his triumphe  walketh shee
With gilte cheynes  on hire nekke hangynge
Coroned was she  after hir degree  
And ful of perree  charged hire clothynge
    
Allas ffortune  she that whilom was
Dredeful  to kynges and to Emperoures
Now gaureth al the peple  on hire allas
And she  that helmed was in starke shoures
And wan by force  townes stronge and toures
Shal on hir heed  now were a vitremyte
And she that bar the ceptre ful of floures
Shal bere a distaf  hire costes for to quyte
Al though  that Nero were vicius
As any feend that lith in helle adoun
Yet he  as telleth vs Swetonius
This wyde world  hadde in subieccioun
Bothe Est and West North  and Septemtrioun
Of Rubies  saphires  and of peerles white
Were alle hise clothes  brouded vp and doun
ffor he in gemmes  greetly gan delite
Moore delicaat moore pompous of array
Moore proud  was neuere Emperour than he
That ilke clooth  þat he hadde wered o day
After that tyme  he nolde it neuere see
Nettes of gold threed  hadde he greet plentee
To fisshe in Tybre  whan hym liste pleye
Hise lustes were al lawe  in his decree
ffor ffortune  as his freend  hym wolde obeye
He Rome brende  for his delicasie
The Senatours  he slow vpon a day
To heere  how men wolde wepe and crie
And slow his brother  and by his suster lay
His mooder made he  in pitous array
ffor he  hire wombe slitte  to biholde
Where he conceyued was so weilaway
That he so litel  of his mooder tolde
    
No teere out of hise eyen  for that sighte
Ne cam  but seyde  a fair womman was she
Greet wonder is  how þat he koude  or myghte
Be domesman  of hire dede beautee
The wyn to bryngen hym comanded he
And drank  anon  noon oother wo he made
Whan myght is ioyned vnto crueltee
Allas to depe  wol the venym wade
In yowthe  a maister hadde this Emperour  
To teche hym lettrure  and curteisye
ffor of moralitee  he was the flour
As in his tyme  but if bookes lye
And whil this maister  hadde of hym maistrye
He maked hym  so konnyng and so sowple
That longe tyme it was  er tirannye
Or any vice  dorste on hym vncowple
This Seneca  of which that I deuyse
By cause Nero  hadde of hym swich drede
ffor he fro vices  wolde hym chastise
Discreetly  as by word  and nat by dede
Sire wolde he seyn  an Emperour moot nede
Be vertuous  and hate tirannye
ffor which  he in a bath  made hym to blede
On bothe hise Armes  til he moste dye
This Nero  hadde eek of acustumaunce
In youthe  agayns his maister for to ryse
Which afterward  hym thoughte greet greuaunce
Therfore  he made hym dyen in this wise
But nathelees  this Seneca the wise
Chees in a Bath to dye  in this manere
Rather than han  any oother tormentise
And thus hath Nero  slayn his maister deere
    
Now fil it so  that ffortune liste no lenger
The hye pryde of Nero to cherice
ffor though þat he was strong yet was she strenger
She thoughte thus  by god I am to nyce
To sette a man  that is fulfild of vice
In heigh degree  and Emperour hym calle
By god  out of his sete  I wol hym trice
Whan he leest weneth  sonnest shal he falle
The peple roos vpon hym on a nyght
ffor his defaute  and whan he it espied
Out of hise dores  anon he hath hym dight
Allone  and ther he wende han ben allied
He knokked faste  and ay the moore he cried
The fastere shette they  the dores alle
ffor drede of this  hym thoughte þat he dyed
And wente his wey  no lenger dorste he calle
The peple cride  and rombled vp and doun
That with his erys  herde he  how they seyde
Where is this false tiraunt this Neroun
ffor fere  almoost out of his wit he breyde  
And to hise goddes  pitously he preyd
ffor socour  but it myghte nat bityde
ffor drede of this  hym thoughte þat he deyde
And ran into a gardyn hym to hyde
And in this gardyn  foond he cherles tweye
That seten by a fyr  greet and reed
And to thise cherles two  he gan to preye
To sleen hym  and to girden of his heed
That to his body  whan þat he were deed
Were no despit ydoon  for his defame
Hym self he slow  he koude no bettre reed
Of which  ffortune lough  and hadde a game
    
Was neuere Capitayn  vnder a kyng
That regnes mo  putte in subieccioun
Ne strenger was in feeld  of alle thyng
As in his tyme  ne gretter of renoun
Ne moore pompous  in heigh presumpcioun
Than Oloferne  which ffortune ay kiste
So likerously  and ladde hym vp and doun
Til þat his heed was of  er þat he wiste
Nat oonly  that this world  hadde hym in Awe
ffor lesynge  of richesse  or libertee
But made euery man  reneyen his lawe
Nabugodonosor  was god seyde hee
Noon oother god   sholde adoured bee
Agayns his heeste  no wight dorste trespace
saue in Bethulia  a strong Citee
Where Eliachim  a preest was of that place
But taak kepe of the deeth of Oloferne
Amydde his hoost he dronke lay a nyght
WithInne his tente  large as is a berne
And yet for al his pompe  and al his myght
Iudith a womman  as he lay vpright
Slepynge  his heed of smoot and from his tente
fful pryuely  she stal from euery wight
And with his heed  vnto hir toun she wente
What nedeth it of kyng Anthiochus
To telle  his hye Roial magestee
His hye pride  hise werkes venymus
ffor swich another  was ther noon as he
Rede which þat he was  in Machabee
And rede  the proude wordes that he seyde
And why he fil  fro heigh prosperitee  
And in an hill  how wrecchedly he deyde
    
ffortune  hym hadde enhaunced so in pride
That verraily  he wende he myghte attayne
Vnto the sterres  vpon euery syde
And in balance  weyen ech montayne
And alle the floodes  of the see restrayne
And goddes peple  hadde he moost in hate
Hem wolde he sleen  in torment and in payne
Wenynge  þat god ne myghte his pride abate
And for that Nichanore  and Thymothee
Of Iewes  weren venquysshed myghtily
Vnto the Iewes  swich an hate hadde he
That he bad  greithen his Chaar ful hastily
And swoor  and seyde ful despitously
Vnto Ierusalem  he wolde eft soone
To wreken his Ire  on it ful cruelly
But of his purpos  he was let ful soone
God for his manace  hym so soore smoot
With invisible wounde  ay incurable
That in hise guttes  carf it so and boot
That hise peynes  weren importable
And certeinly  the wreche was resonable
ffor many a mannes guttes  dide he peyne
But from his purpos  cursed and dampnable
ffor all his smert he wolde hym nat restreyne
But bad anon  apparaillen his hoost
And sodeynly  er he was of it war
God daunted  al his pride and all his boost
ffor he so soore  fil out of his Char
That it hise lemes  and his skyn totar
So that he neyther myghte go ne ryde
But in a chayer  men  aboute hym bar
Al forbrused  bothe bak and syde
    
The wreche of god  hym smoot so cruelly
That thurgh his body  wikked wormes crepte
And therwithal  he stank horriblely
That noon of al his meynee  þat hym kepte
Wheither so he wook or ellis slepte
Ne myghte noght for stynk of hym endure
In this meschief  he wayled and eek wepte
And knew god  lord of euery creature
To all his hoost and to hym self also  
fful wlatsom was  the stynk of his careyne
No man  ne myghte hym bere  to ne fro
And in this stynk and this horrible peyne
He starf ful wrecchedly  in a Monteyne
Thus hath this Robbour  and this homycide
That many a man  made to wepe and pleyne
Swich gerdon  as bilongeth vnto pryde
The storie of Alisaundre  is so commune
That euery wight that hath discrecioun
Hath herd somwhat or al  of his ffortune
This wyde world  as in conclusioun
He wan by strengthe  or for his hye renoun
They weren glad  for pees vnto hym sende
The pride  of man and beest  he leyde adoun
Wher so he cam  vnto the worldes ende
Comparison  myghte neuere yet been maked
Bitwixen hym  and another Conquerour
ffor al this world  for drede of hym hath quaked
He  of knyghthod and of fredom flour
ffortune hym made  the heir of hire honour
Saue wyn and wommen  no man mighte aswage
His hye entente in Armes and labour
So was he ful  of leonyn corage
    
What pris were it to hym  though I yow tolde
Of Darius  and an hundred thousand mo
Of kynges  princes  Erles  dukes  bolde
Whiche he conquered  and broghte hem into wo
I seye  as fer as man may ryde or go
The world was his  what sholde I moore deuyse
ffor though I write  or tolde yow eueremo
Of his knyghthode  it myghte nat suffise
Twelf yeer he regned  as seith Machabee
Philippes sone of Macidoyne he was
That first was kyng in Grece the contree
O worthy gentil Alisandre allas
That euere sholde fallen swich a cas
Empoysoned  of thyn owene folk thou weere
Thy sys  ffortune  hath turned into Aas
And  for thee  ne weepe she neuer a teere
Who shal me yeuen teeris to compleyne
The deeth of gentillesse  and of ffranchise
That al the world  weelded in his demeyne
And yet hym thoughte  it myghte nat suffise  
So ful was his corage  of heigh emprise
Allas  who shal me helpe to endite
ffalse ffortune  and poyson to despise
The whiche two  of al this wo I wyte
By wisedom  manhede  and by labour
ffrom humble bed  to roial magestee
Vp roos he Iulius the Conquerour
That wan al thoccident by land and See
By strengthe of hand  or elles by tretee
And vnto Rome  made hem tributarie
And sitthe of Rome  the Emperour was he
Til that ffortune  weex his Aduersarie
    
O myghty Cesar  that in Thessalie
Agayn Pompeus  fader thyn in lawe
That of the Orient hadde all the Chiualrie
As fer as þat the day bigynneth dawe
Thou thurgh thy knyghthod  hast hem take and slawe
Saue fewe folk  that with Pompeus fledde
Thurgh which thou puttest al thorient in Awe
Thanke ffortune  that so wel thee spedde
 But now a litel while  I wol biwaille
This Pompeus  this noble gouernour
Of Rome  which that fleigh at this bataille
I seye  oon of hise men  a fals traitour
His heed of smoot to wynnen hym fauour
Of Iulius  and hym the heed he broghte
Allas Pompeye  of Thorient Conquerour
That ffortune  vnto swich a fyn thee broghte
 To Rome agayn  repaireth Iulius
With his triumphe  lauriat ful hye
But on a tyme  Brutus Cassius
That euere hadde  of his hye estaat envye
fful priuely  hath maad conspiracye
Agayns this Iulius  in subtil wise
And caste the place  in which he sholde dye
With Boydekyns  as I shal yow deuyse
This Iulius  to the Capitolie wente
Vpon a day  as he was wont to goon
And in the Capitolie  anon hym hente
This false Brutus  and hise othere foon
And stiked hym  with boydekyns anoon
With many a wounde  and thus they lete hym lye
But neuere gronte he  at no strook but oon  
Or elles at two  but if his storie lye
    
So manly  was this Iulius of herte
And so wel louede  estaatly honestee
That though hise deedly woundes soore smerte
His Mantel  ouer hise hypes caste he
ffor no man  sholde seen his priuetee
And as he lay  of diyng in a traunce
And wiste verraily  that deed was hee
Of honestee  yet hadde he remembraunce
Lucan  to thee  this storie I recomende
And to Sweton  and to Valerius also
That of this storie  writen word and ende
How þat  to thise grete Conquerours two
ffortune was first freend  and sitthe foo
No man ne truste  vpon hire fauour longe
But haue hire  in awayt for euere moo
Witnesse  on alle thise Conquerours stronge
This riche Cresus  whilom kyng of Lyde
Of which Cresus  Cirus soore hym dradde
Yet was he caught amyddes al his pryde
And to be brent men to the fyr hym ladde
But swich a reyn  doun fro the welkne shadde
That slow the fyr  and made hym to escape
But to be war  no grace yet he hadde
Til ffortune  on the galwes  made hym gape
Whanne he escaped was  he kan nat stente
ffor to bigynne  a newe werre agayn
He wende wel  for þat ffortune hym sente
Swich hape  that he escaped thurgh the rayn
That of hise foos  he myghte nat be slayn
And eek a sweuene  vpon a nyght he mette
Of which  he was so proud  and eek so fayn
That in vengeance  he al his herte sette
      
Vpon a tree  he was  as that hym thoughte
Ther Iuppiter hym wesshe  bothe bak and syde
And Phebus eek a fair towaille hym broughte
To dryen hym with  and therfore wax his pryde
And to his doghter  that stood hym bisyde
Which þat he knew  in heigh science habounde
He bad hire telle hym  what it signyfyde
And she his dreem  bigan right thus expounde
The tree quod she  the galwes is to meene  
And Iuppiter  bitokneth snow and reyn
And Phebus  with his towaille so clene
Tho been  the sonne bemes for to seyn
Thou shalt anhanged be  fader certeyn
Reyn shal thee wasshe  and sonne shal thee drye
Thus warned hym  ful plat and ful pleyn
His doghter  which that called was Phanye
Anhanged was Cresus  the proude kyng
His roial Trone  myghte hym nat auaille
Tragedies  noon oother maner thyng 
Ne kan in syngyng crie ne biwaille
But that ffortune  alwey wole assaille
With vnwar strook  the Regnes þat been proude
ffor whan men trusteth hire  thanne wol she faille
And couere hire brighte face  with a clowde
Onoble  o worthy Petro  glorie of Spayne
Whom ffortune heeld  so hye in magestee
Wel oghten men  thy pitous deeth complayne
Out of thy land  thy brother made thee flee
And after at a seege by subtiltee
Thou were bitraysed  and lad vnto his tente
Where as he  with his owene hand slow thee
Succedynge  in thy regne and in thy rente
    
The feeld of snow  with thegle of blak therInne
Caught with the lymerod  coloured as the gleede
He brew this cursednesse  and al this synne
The wikked nest was werker of this nede
Noght Charles Olyuver  that took ay heede
Of trouthe and honour  but of Armorike
Genylon Olyuer  corrupt for meede
Broghte this worthy kyng in swich a brike
Oworthy Petro  kyng of Cipre also
That Alisandre wan  by heigh maistrie
fful many an hethen  wroghtestow ful wo
Of which  thyne owene liges hadde envie
And for no thyng but for thy Chiualrie
They in thy bed  han slayn thee by the morwe
Thus kan ffortune  hir wheel gouerne and gye
And out of Ioye  brynge men to sorwe
Off Melan  grete Barnabo Viscounte
God of delit and scourge of Lumbardye
Why sholde I nat thyn Infortune acounte
Sith in estaat  thow cloumbe were so hye  
Thy brother sone  that was thy double allye
ffor he thy Nevew was  and sone in lawe
WithInne his prison  made thee to dye
But why ne how  noot I þat thou were slawe
Off the Erl Hugelyn of Pyze  the langour
Ther may no tonge  telle for pitee
But litel out of Pize  stant a tour
In which tour in prison put was he
And with hym  been hise litel children thre
The eldeste  scarsly  fyf yeer was of Age
Allas ffortune  it was greet crueltee
Swiche briddes  for to putte  in swiche a Cage
    
Dampned was he  to dyen in that prison
ffor Roger  which þat Bisshope was of Pize
Hadde on hym maad  a fals suggestion
Thurgh which  the peple  gan vpon hym rise
And putten hym to prison  in swich wise
As ye han herd  and mete  and drynke he hadde
So smal  that vnnethe it may suffise
And therwithal  it was ful poure and badde
And on a day  bifil  þat in that hour
Whan þat his mete  wont was to be broght
The Gayler shette the dores of the tour
He herde it wel  but he spak right noght
And in his herte  anon ther fil a thoght
That they for hunger  wolde doon hym dyen
Allas quod he  allas that I was wroght
Therwith  the teeris fillen from hise eyen
His yonge sone  that thre yeer was of age
Vnto hym seyde  fader  fader  why do ye wepe
Whanne wol the Gayler  bryngen oure potage
Is ther no morsel breed  that ye do kepe
I am so hungry  that I may nat slepe
Now wolde god  that I myghte slepen euere
Thanne sholde nat hunger  in my wombe crepe
Ther is no thyng but breed  that me were leuere
Thus day by day  this child bigan to crye
Til in his fadres barm  adoun it lay
And seyde  fare wel fader  I moot dye
And kiste his fader and dyde the same day
And whan the woful fader deed it say
ffor wo  hise Armes two  he gan to byte
And seyde  Allas ffortune and weylaway  
Thy false wheel  my wo al may I wyte
  
Hise children wende  that it for hunger was
That he hise Armes gnow  and nat for wo
And seyde fader do nat so Allas
But rather ete the flessh vpon vs two
Oure flessh thou yaf  take oure flessh vs fro
And ete ynogh  right thus they to hym seyde
And after that withInne a day or two
They leyde hem  in his lappe adoun and deyde
Hymself despeired  eek for hunger starf
Thus ended is  this myghty Erl of Pize
ffrom heigh estaat ffortune awey hym carf
Of this Tragedie  it oghte ynough suffise
Who so wol here it in a lenger wise
Redeth  the grete Poete of ytaille
That highte Dant for he kan al deuyse
ffro point to point nat o word wol he faille
Hoo quod the knyght  good sire namoore this
That ye han seyd  is right ynough ywis
And muchel moore  for litel heuynesse
Is right ynough  to muche folk I gesse
I seye for me  it is a greet disese
Where as men han been  in greet welthe and ese
To heeren  of hire sodeyn fal allas
And the contrarie  is ioye and greet solas
As whan a man  hath ben in poure estaat
And clymbeth vp  and wexeth fortunat
And there abideth  in prosperitee
Swich thyng is gladsom  as it thynketh me
And of swich thyng were goodly for to telle
Ye quod oure hoost by seint Poules belle

That þat is doon  and als it is a peyne
As ye han seyd  to heere of heuynesse
 Sire monk namoore of this  so god yow blesse
Youre tale  anoyeth all this compaignye

Althogh the slough  had neuer been so deepe
Thanne hadde your tale  al be toold in veyn

Where as a man  may haue noon Audience
Noght helpeth it to tellen his sentence
And wel I woot the substance is in me
If any thyng shal wel reported be
Sir  sey somwhat of huntyng I yow preye
 Nay quod this Monk I haue no lust to pleye
Now lat another telle  as I haue toold
Thanne spak oure hoost with rude speche and boold
And seyde  vnto the Nonnes preest anon
Com neer thou preest com hyder thou sir Iohn

But I be myrie  ywis I wol be blamed
And right anon  his tale he hath attamed
And thus he seyde  vnto vs euerichon
This sweete preest this goodly man sir Iohn
A poure wydwe  somdel stape in Age
Was whilom dwellyng in a narwe cotage
Beside a greue  stondynge in a dale
This wydwe  of which I telle yow my tale
Syn thilke day  that she was last a wyf
In pacience  ladde a ful symple lyf
ffor litel  was hir catel and hir rente
By housbondrie  of swich as god hire sente
She foond hir self  and eek hire doghtren two
Thre large sowes  hadde she and namo
Three keen  and eek a sheep þat highte Malle
fful sooty  was hir bour and eek hire halle
In which she eet ful many a sklendre Meel
Of poynaunt sauce  hir neded neuer a deel
No deyntee morsel  passed thurgh hir throte
Hir diete  was accordant to hir Cote
Repleccion  ne made hire neuere sik 
Attempree diete  was al hir phisik 
And exercise  and hertes suffisaunce
The goute  lette hire nothyng for to daunce
Napoplexie  shente nat hir heed
No wyn ne drank  she  neither whit ne reed
Hir bord was serued moost with whit and blak
Milk and broun breed  in which she foond no lak
Seynd Bacon  and somtyme an Ey or tweye
ffor she was  as it were  a maner deye
 A yeerd she hadde  enclosed al aboute
With stikkes  and a drye dych withoute
In which  she hadde a Cok heet Chauntecleer
In al the land  of crowyng nas his peer
  
His voys was murier than the murie Orgon
On Messedayes  that in the chirche gon
Wel sikerer was his crowyng in his logge
Than is a Clokke  or an abbey Orlogge
By nature  he crew eche Ascencioun
Of the equynoxial in thilke toun
ffor whan degrees fiftene weren ascended
Thanne crew he  that it myghte nat been amended
His Coomb was redder  than the fyn coral
And batailled  as it were a Castel wal
His byle was blak and as the Ieet it shoon
Lyk Asure  were hise legges and his toon
Hise nayles  whiter than the lylye flour
And lyk the burned gold  was his colour
This gentil Cok hadde in his gouernaunce  
Seuene hennes  for to doon al his plesaunce
Whiche were  hise sustres and his paramours
And wonder lyk to hym  as of colours
Of whiche  the faireste hewed  on hir throte
Was cleped  faire damoysele Pertelote
Curteys she was  discreet and debonaire
And compaignable  and bar hyr self so faire
Syn thilke day  þat she was seuen nyght oold
That trewely  she hath the herte in hoold
Of Chauntecleer  loken in euery lith
He loued hire so  þat wel was hym therwith
But swiche a ioye was it to here hem synge
Whan þat  the brighte sonne  bigan to sprynge
In sweete accord  My lief is faren in londe
ffor thilke tyme  as I haue vnderstonde
Beestes and briddes  koude speke and synge
 And so bifel  that in the dawenynge
As Chauntecleer  among hise wyues alle
Sat on his perche  that was in the halle
And next hym  sat this faire Pertelote
This Chauntecleer  gan gronen in his throte
  
As man þat in his dreem  is drecched soore
 And whan that Pertelote  thus herde hym roore
She was agast and seyde o herte deere
What eyleth yow  to grone in this manere
Ye been a verray sleper  fy for shame
 And he answerde  and seyde thus  madame
I pray yow  that ye take it nat agrief
By god me thoughte  I was in swich meschief
Right now  þat yet myn herte is soore afright
Now god quod he  my sweuene recche aright
And kepe my body  out of foul prisoun
Me mette  how that I romed vp and doun
WithInne our yeerd  wheer as I saugh a beest
Was lyk an hound  and wolde han maad areest
Vpon my body  and han had me deed
His colour was bitwixe yelow and reed
And tipped was his tayl  and bothe hise eeris
With blak  vnlyk the remenant of hise heeris
His snowte smal  with glowynge eyen tweye
Yet of his look for feere almoost I deye
This caused me  my gronyng doutelees
 Avoy quod she  fy on yow hertelees
Allas quod she  for by that god aboue
Now han ye lost myn herte and al my loue
I kan nat loue a Coward  by my feith
ffor certes  what so any womman seith
We alle desiren  if it myghte bee  
To han housbondes  hardy wise and free
And secree  and no Nygard  ne no fool
Ne hym  þat is agast of euery tool
Ne noon auauntour  by that god aboue
How dorste ye seyn for shame  vnto youre loue
That any thyng myghte make yow aferd
Haue ye no mannes herte  and han a berd
 Allas and konne ye been agast of sweuenys
No thyng god woot  but vanitee in sweuene is
  
Sweuenes  engendren of repleccions
And ofte of fume  and of compleccions
Whan humours  been to habundant in a wight
 Certes this dreem  which ye han met tonyght
Cometh  of greet superfluytee
Of youre rede Colera pardee
Which causeth folk  to dreden in hir dremes
Of Arwes  and of fyre with rede lemes
Of grete beestes  that they wol hem byte
Of contekes and of whelpes  grete and lyte
Right as the humour of Malencolie
Causeth ful many a man  in sleepe to crie
ffor feere of blake beres  or boles blake
Or elles  blake deueles wole hem take
 Of othere humours  koude I telle also
That werken many a man  in sleepe ful wo
But I wol passe  as lightly as I kan
LO Caton which þat was so wys a man
Seyde he nat thus  ne do no fors of dremes
 Now sire quod she  whan ye flee fro the bemes
ffor goddes loue  as taak som laxatyf
Vp peril of my soule  and of my lyf
I conseille yow the beste  I wol nat lye
That bothe of Colere  and of Malencolye
Ye purge yow  and for ye shal nat tarie
Though in this toun  is noon Apothecarie
I shal my self to herbes techen yow
That shul been  for youre hele  and for youre prow
And in oure yeerd  tho herbes shal I fynde
The whiche han  of hire propretee by kynde
To purge yow  bynethe and eek aboue
fforyet nat this  for goddes owene loue
Ye been ful coleryk of compleccion
Ware the sonne  in his ascencion
Ne fynde yow nat repleet of humours hoote
And if it do  I dar wel leye a grote
  
That ye shul haue  a ffeuere terciane
Or an Agu  that may be youre bane
A day or two  ye shul haue digestyues  
Of wormes  er ye take youre laxatyues
Of lawriol  Centaure  and ffumetere
Or elles of Ellebor  that groweth there
Of katapuce  or of Gaitrys beryis
Of herbe yue growyng in oure yeerd ther mery is
Pekke hem vp right as they growe and ete hem yn
Be myrie housbonde  for youre fader kyn
Dredeth no dreem  I kan sey yow namoore
Madame quod he  graunt mercy of youre loore
But nathelees  as touchyng Daun Catoun
That hath of wysdom  swich a greet renoun
Though that he bad  no dremes for to drede
By god  men may  in olde bookes rede
Of many a man  moore of Auctorite
Than euere Caton was  so moot I thee
That al the reuers seyn  of this sentence
And han wel founden by experience
That dremes  been significacions
As wel of Ioye  as of tribulacions
That folk enduren  in this lif present
Ther nedeth  make of this noon Argument
The verray preeue  sheweth it in dede
 Oon  of the gretteste Auctour  þat men rede
Seith thus  þat whilom two felawes wente
On pilgrimage  in a ful good entente
And happed so  they coomen in a toun
Wher as ther was  swich congregacioun
Of peple  and eek so streit of herbergage
That they ne founde  as muche as o cotage
In which they bothe  myghte logged bee
Wherfore  they mosten of necessitee
As for that nyght departen compaignye
And ech of hem  gooth to his hostelrye
  
And took his loggyng as it wolde falle
That oon of hem  was logged in a stalle
ffer in a yeerd  with Oxen of the plough
That oother man  was logged wel ynough
As was his Auenture  or his ffortune
That vs gouerneth alle  as in commune
 And so bifel  þat longe er it were day
This man mette in his bed ther as he lay
How þat his felawe  gan vpon hym calle
And seyde Allas  for in an Oxes stalle
This nyght I shal be mordred  ther I lye
Now helpe me deere brother  or I dye
In alle haste  com to me he sayde
 This man out of his sleepe  for feere abrayde
But whan that he was wakened  of his sleepe  
He turned hym  and took of it no keepe
Hym thoughte  his dreem nas but a vanitee
Thus twies  in his slepyng dremed hee
And atte thridde tyme  yet his felawe
Cam as hym thoughte  and seide I am now slawe
Bihoold my bloody woundes depe and wyde
Arys vp erly  in the morwe tyde
And at the West gate  of the toun quod he
A Carte  ful of donge  ther shaltow se
In Which  my body is hid  ful priuely
Do thilke Carte  arresten boldely
My gold caused my mordre  sooth to sayn
And tolde hym euery point how he was slayn
With a ful pitous face  pale of hewe
And truste wel  his dreem he foond ful trewe
ffor on the morwe  as soone as it was day
To his felawes In  he took the way
And whan þat he cam  to this Oxes stalle
After his felawe  he bigan to calle
 The hostiler  answerde hym anon
And seyde sire  your felawe is agon
  
As soone as day  he wente out of the toun
 This man  gan fallen in suspecioun
Remembrynge  on hise dremes  þat he mette
And forth he gooth  no lenger wolde he lette
Vnto the westgate of the toun  and fond
A dong Carte  as it were to donge lond
That was arrayed  in that same wise
As ye han herd  the dede man deuyse
And with an hardy herte  he gan to crye
Vengeance and Iustice  of this felonye
My felawe  mordred is  this same nyght
And in this Carte  heere he lith gapyng vpright
I crye out on the Ministres quod he
That sholden kepe  and reulen this Citee
Harrow allas  heere lith my felawe slayn
What sholde I moore  vnto this tale sayn
The peple out sterte  and caste the Cart to grounde
And in the myddel of the dong they founde
The dede man  that mordred was al newe
O blisful god  that art so Iust and trewe
Lo  howe þat thou biwreyest mordre alway
Mordre wol out  that se we day by day
Mordre  is so wlatsom  and abhomynable
To god  that is so Iust and resonable
That he  ne wol nat suffre it heled be
Though it abyde  a yeer  or two  or thre
Mordre wol out this my conclusioun  
And right anon  Ministres of that toun
Han hent the Carter  and so soore hym pyned
And eek the hostiler  so soore engyned
That they biknewe  hire wikkednesse anon
And were anhanged  by the nekke bon
 Heere may men seen  þat dremes been to drede
And certes  in the same book  I rede
Right in the nexte Chapitre after this
I gabbe nat so haue I ioye or blis
  
Two men  that wolde han passed ouer see
ffor certeyn cause  in to a fer contree
If that the wynd  ne hadde been contrarie
That made hem  in a Citee for to tarie
That stood ful myrie  vpon an hauen syde
But on a day  agayn the euen tyde
The wynd gan chaunge  and blew right as hem leste
Iolif and glad  they wente vnto hir reste
And casten hem  ful erly for to saille
 But herkneth  to that o man  fil a greet meruaille
That oon of hem  in slepyng as he lay
Hym mette a wonder dreem  agayn the day
Him thoughte  a man stood by his beddes syde
And hym comanded  þat he sholde abyde
And seyde hym thus  if thou tomorwe wende
Thow shalt be dreynt my tale is at an ende
 He wook  and tolde his felawe what he mette
And preyde hym  his viage to lette
As for that day  he preyde hym to byde
 His felawe  that lay  by his beddes syde
Gan for to laughe  and scorned him ful faste
No dreem quod he  may so myn herte agaste
That I wol lette  for to do my thynges
I sette nat a straw  by thy dremynges
ffor sweuenes  been but vanytees and Iapes
Men dreme al day  of Owles  or of Apes
And of many a maze  therwithal
Men dreme of thyng þat neuere was ne shal
But sith I see  that thou wolt heere abyde
And thus forslewthen  wilfully thy tyde
God woot it reweth me  and haue good day
And thus  he took his leue  and wente his way
But er þat he hadde  half his cours yseyled
Noot I nat why  ne what myschaunce it eyled
But casuelly  the shippes botme rente
And shipe and man  vnder the water wente
  
In sighte of othere shippes  it bisyde
That with hem seyled  at the same tyde
And therfore  faire Pertelote so deere  
By swiche ensamples olde  yet maistow leere
That no man  sholde been to recchelees
Of dremes  for I seye thee doutelees
That many a dreem  ful soore is for to drede
LO  in the lyf of seint kenelm  I rede
That was kenulphus sone  the noble kyng
Of Mertenrike  how kenelm mette a thyng
A lite er he was mordred  on a day
His mordre  in his Auysion he say
His Norice  hym expowned euery deel
His sweuene  and bad hym for to kepe hym weel
ffor traison  but he nas but vij yeer oold
And therfore  litel tale hath he toold
Of any dreem  so hooly is his herte
By god  I hadde leuere than my sherte
That ye hadde rad his legende  as haue I
Dame Pertelote  I sey yow trewely
Macrobeus  that writ the Avision
In Affrike  of the worthy Cipion
Affermeth dremes  and seith þat they been
Warnynge of thynges  þat men after seen
 And forthermoore I pray yow looketh wel
In the olde testament of Daniel
If he  heeld dremes any vanitee
 Reed eek of Ioseph  and ther shul ye see
Wher dremes be somtyme  I sey nat alle
Warnynge  of thynges  þat shul after falle
 Looke of Egipte  the kyng daun Pharao
His Baker  and his Butiller also
Wher they ne felte noon effect in dremes
Who so wol seken actes  of sondry Remes
May rede of dremes  many a wonder thyng
 Lo Cresus  which þat was of Lyde kyng
  
Mette he nat that he sat vpon a tree
Which signified  he sholde anhanged bee
 Lo heere Adromacha  Ectores wyf
That day  that Ector  sholde lese his lyf
She dremed  on the same nyght biforn
How þat the lyf of Ector  sholde be lorne
If thilke day  he wente into bataille
She warned hym  but it myghte nat auaille
He wente  for to fighte natheles
But he was slayn anon of Achilles
But thilke tale is al to longe for to telle
And eek it is ny day  I may nat dwelle
Shortly I seye  as for conclusion
That I shal han  of this Avision
Aduersitee  and I seye forthermoor  
That I ne telle  of laxatyues no stoor
ffor they been venymes  I woot it weel
I hem diffye  I loue hem neuer a deel
 Now let vs speke of myrthe  and stynte al this
Madame Pertelote  so haue I blis
Of o thyng god hath sent me large grace
ffor whan I se  the beautee of youre face
Ye been so scarlet reed  aboute youre eyen
It maketh  al my drede for to dyen
ffor al so siker  as In principio
Mulier est hominis confusio
 Madame  the sentence  of this latyn is
Womman is mannes Ioye  and al his blis
ffor whan I feele a nyght your softe syde
Al be it that I may nat on yow ryde
ffor þat oure perche  is maad so narwe allas
I am so ful of ioye  and of solas
That I diffye  bothe sweuene and dreem
And with that word  he fly doun fro the beem
ffor it was day  and eke hise hennes alle
And with a chuk  he gan hem for to calle
  
ffor he hadde founde a corn  lay in the yerd
Real he was  he was namoore aferd
And fethered Pertelote  twenty tyme
And trad as ofte  er it was pryme
He looketh  as it were  a grym leoun
And on hise toos  he rometh vp and doun
Hym deigned nat to sette his foot to grounde
He chukketh  whan he hath a corn yfounde
And to hym rennen thanne  hise wyues alle
Thus roial  as a prince is in an halle
Leue I this Chauntecleer  in his pasture
And after  wol I telle  his auenture
Whan þat the Monthe  in which the world bigan
That highte March  whan god first maked man
Was compleet and passed were also
Syn March bigan  thritty dayes and two
Bifel  that Chauntecleer  in al his pryde
Hise seuene wyues  walkynge by his syde
Caste vp hise eyen  to the brighte sonne
That in the signe of Taurus  hadde yronne
Twenty degrees and oon  and somwhat moore
And knew by kynde  and by noon oother loore
That it was Pryme  and crew with blisful steuene
The sonne he seyde  is clomben vp on heuene
ffourty degrees and oon  and moore ywis
Madame Pertelote  my worldes blis
Herkneth thise blisful briddes  how they synge  
And se  the fresshe floures  how they sprynge
fful is myn herte  of reuel and solas
But sodeynly  hym fil a sorweful cas
ffor euere  the latter ende of ioye is wo
God woot þat worldly ioye  is soone ago
And if a Rethor  koude faire endite
He in a Cronycle saufly myghte it write
As for a souereyn notabilitee
Now euery wys man  lat him herkne me
  
This storie  is al so trewe I vndertake
As is the book  of launcelot de lake
That wommen holde  in ful greet reuerence
Now wol I  come  agayn to my sentence
A Colfox  ful of sly Iniquitee
That in the groue  hadde wonned yeres three
By heigh ymaginacion  forncast
The same nyght  thurghout the hegges brast
Into the yerd  ther Chauntecleer the faire
Was wont and eek hise wyues to repaire
And in a bed of wortes  stille he lay
Til it was passed  vndren of the day
Waitynge his tyme  on Chauntecleer to falle
As gladly  doon thise homycides alle
That in await liggen  to mordre men
O false mordrour  lurkynge in thy den
O newe Scariot newe Genylon
ffalse dissynulour  o greek synon
That broghtest Troye  al outrely to sorwe
O Chauntecleer  acursed be that morwe
That thou into that yerd  flaugh fro the bemes
Thou were  ful wel ywarned by thy dremes
That thilke day  was perilous to thee
But what þat god forwoot moot nedes bee
After the opinion  of certein clerkis
Witnesse on hym  that any parfit clerk is
That in scole  is greet altercacion
In this mateere  and greet disputison
And hath been  of an hundred thousand men
But I ne kan nat bulte it to the bren
As kan the hooly doctour Augustyn
Or Boece  or the Bisshope Bradwardyn
Wheither  that goddes  worthy forwityng
Streyneth me  nedefully to doon a thyng
Nedely  clepe I  symple necessitee
Or elles  if free choys be graunted me
  
To do that same thyng or do it noght
Though god forwoot it er þat it was wroght
Or if his wityng streyneth neuer a deel  
But by necessitee condicioneel
I wil nat han to do  of swich mateere
My tale is of a Cok as ye may heere
That took his conseil  of his wyf with sorwe
To walken in the yerd  vpon that morwe
That he hadde met that dreem  þat I of tolde
Wommennes conseils  been ful ofte colde
Wommannes conseil  broghte vs first to wo
And made Adam  out of Paradys to go
Ther as he was ful myrie  and wel at ese
But for I noot to whom it myght displese
If I  conseil of wommen wolde blame
Passe ouer  for I seye it in my game
Rede Auctours  where they trete  of swich mateere
And what they seyn of wommen  ye may heere
Thise been the Cokkes wordes  and nat myne
I kan noon harm  of no womman diuyne
Faire in the soond  to bathe hire myrily
Lith Pertelote  and alle hire sustres by
Agayn the sonne  and Chauntecleer so free
Soong murier  than the Mermayde in the see
ffor Phisiologus  seith sikerly
How þat they syngen  wel and myrily
 And so bifel  that as he cast his eye
Among the wortes  on a Boterflye
He was war of this fox  þat lay ful lowe
Nothyng ne liste hym thanne for to crowe
But cride anon cok  cok  and vp he sterte
As man  that was affrayed in his herte
ffor natureelly  a beest desireth flee
ffro his contrarie  if he may it see
Though he neuer erst hadde seyn it with his eye
 This Chauntecleer  whan he gan hym espye
  
He wolde han fled  but that the fox anon
Seyde gentil sire  allas wher wol ye gon
Be ye affrayed of me  that am youre freend
Now certes  I were worse than a feend
If I to yow  wolde harm  or vileynye
I am nat come  your conseil for tespye
But trewely  the cause of my comynge
Was oonly  for to herkne how that ye synge
ffor trewely  ye haue as myrie a steuene
As any Aungel  that is in heuene
Therwith ye han in Musyk moore feelynge
Than hadde Boece  or any þat kan synge
My lord youre fader  god his soule blesse
And eek youre mooder of hire gentillesse
Han in myn hous ybeen  to my greet ese  
And certes sire  ful fayn wolde I yow plese
 But for men speke of syngyng I wol yow seye
So moote I brouke wel  myne eyen tweye
Saue yow  herde I neuere man yet synge
As dide youre fader  in the morwenynge
Certes  it was of herte  al that he song
And for to make  his voys  the moore strong
He wolde so peyne hym  that with bothe hise eyen
He moste wynke  so loude he wolde cryen
And stonden on his tiptoon  therwithal
And strecche forth his nekke  long and smal
And eek he was  of swich discrecion
That ther nas  no man in no Region
That hym  in song or wisedom myghte passe
I haue wel rad  in daun Burnel the Asse
Among hise vers  how that ther was a Cok
ffor that a preestes sone  yaf hym a knok
Vpon his leg whil he was yong and nyce
He made hym  for to lese his benefice
But certeyn  ther nys no comparison
Bitwixe  the wisedom  and discrecion
  
Of youre fader  and of his subtiltee
Now syngeth sire  for seinte charitee
Lat se  konne ye youre fader countrefete
 This Chauntecleer  hise wynges gan to bete
As man  þat koude his trayson nat espie
So was he rauysshed with his flaterie
Allas ye lordes  many a fals flatour
Is in youre Courtes  and many a losengeour
That plesen yow  wel moore by my feith
Than he  that soothfastnesse  vnto yow seith
Redeth Ecclesiaste  of fflaterye
Beth war ye lordes  of hir trecherye
 This Chauntecleer  stood hye vp on his toos
Strecchynge his nekke  and heeld hise eyen cloos
And gan to crowe  loude for the nones
And daun Russell the fox  stirte vp atones
And by the gargat hente Chauntecleer
And on his bak  toward the wode hym beer
ffor yet ne was ther no man  þat hym sewed
 O destinee  that mayst nat been eschewed
Allas  þat Chauntecleer  fleigh fro the bemes
Allas  his wyf  ne roghte nat of dremes
And on a friday  fil al this meschaunce
 O Venus  that art goddesse of plesaunce
Syn that thy seruant was this Chauntecleer  
And in thy seruyce  dide al his poweer
Moore for delit than world to multiplye
Why woltestow suffre hym  on thy day to dye
 O Gaufred deere Maister souerayn
That whan thy worthy kyng Richard was slayn
With shot compleynedest his deeth so soere
Why ne hadde I now  thy sentence  and thy loore
The friday for to chide  as diden ye
ffor on a friday  soothly slayn was he
Thanne wolde I shewe yow  how þat I koude pleyne
ffor Chauntecleres drede  and for his peyne
  
 Certes  swich cry  ne lamentacion
Was neuere  of ladyes maad  whan Ylion
Was wonne  and Pirrus with his streite swerd
Whan he hadde hent kyng Priam  by the berd
And slayn hym  as seith vs Eneydos
As maden  alle the hennes in the clos
Whan they had seyn  of Chauntecleer the sighte
But sodeynly  dame Pertelote shrighte
fful louder than dide Hasdrubales wyf
Whan þat hir housbonde  hadde lost his lyf
And þat the Romayns  hadde brend Cartage
She was  so ful of torment and of rage
That wilfully  into the fyr she sterte
And brende hir seluen  with a stedefast herte
 O woful hennes  right so criden ye
As whan that Nero  brende the Citee
Of Rome  cryden senatours wyues
ffor þat hir husbondes losten alle hir lyues
Withouten gilt this Nero hath hem slayn
Now turne I wole  to my tale agayn
This sely wydwe  and eek hir doghtres two
Herden thise hennes crie  and maken wo
And out at dores  stirten they anon
And syen the fox  toward the groue gon
And bar vpon his bak  the Cok away
And cryden out harrow  and weylaway
Ha ha  the fox  and after hym they ran
And eek with staues  many another man
Ran Colle oure dogge  and Talbot and Gerland
And Malkyn  with a dystaf  in hir hand
Ran Cow and Calf and the verray hogges
So fered  for berkyng of the dogges
And shoutyng of the men and wommen eek ·
They ronne so  hem thoughte hir herte breek
They yolleden  as feendes doon in helle
The dokes cryden  as men wolde hem quelle
  
The gees for feere  flowen ouer the trees  
Out of the hyve  cam the swarm of bees
So hydous was the noyse  a benedicitee
Certes  he Iakke Straw  and his meynee
Ne made neuere  shoutes  half so shille
Whan þat they wolden  any flemyng kille
As thilke day  was maad vpon the fox
Of bras  they broghten bemes and of box
Of horn  of boon  in whiche they blewe and powped
And therwithal  they skriked  and they howped
It semed  as that heuene sholde falle
Now goode men  I pray yow herkneth alle
Lo  how ffortune  turneth sodeynly
The hope  and pryde  of hir enemy
This Cok  that lay vpon the foxes bak
In al his drede  vnto the fox he spak
And seyde sire  if that I were as ye
Yet wolde I seyn  as wys god helpe me
Turneth agayn  ye proude cherles alle
A verray pestilence  vpon yow falle
Now am I come  vnto the wodes syde
Maugree youre heed  the Cox shal heere abyde
I wol hym ete in feith  and that anon
 The fox answerde  in feith it shal be don
And as he spak that word  al sodeynly
This Cok  brak from his mouth delyuerly
And heighe vpon a tree  he fleigh anon
And whan the fox saugh  þat he was gon
 Allas quod he  o Chauntecleer  allas
I haue to yow quod he ydoon trespas
In as muche  as I maked yow aferd
Whan I yow hente  and broght in to this yerd
But sire I dide it of no wikke entente
Com doun  and I shal telle yow what I mente
I shal seye sooth to yow  god help me so
 Nay thanne quod he  I shrewe vs bothe two
  
And first I shrewe my self  bothe blood and bones
If thou bigyle me  any ofter than ones
Thou shalt na moore  thurgh thy flaterye
Do me to synge  and wynke with myn eye
ffor he that wynketh  whan he sholde see
Al wilfully  god lat him neuere thee
 Nay quod the fox  but god yeue hym meschaunce
That is so  vndiscreet of gouernaunce
That Iangleth  whan he sholde holde his pees
 Lo swich it is  for to be recchelees
And necligent and truste on flaterye
 But ye  that holden  this tale a folye
As of a fox  or of a Cok and Hen  
Taketh the moralite  goode men
ffor seint Paul seith  þat al that writen is
To oure doctrine  it is ywrite ywis
Taketh the fruyt and lat the chaf be stille
Now goode god  if that it be thy wille
As seith my lord  so make vs alle goode men
And brynge vs  to his heighe blisse Amen
THe Ministre and the Norice  vnto vices
Which that men clepe in Englissh ydelnesse
That Porter of the gate is  of delices
To eschue  and by hire contrarie  hire oppresse
That is to seyn  by leueful bisynesse
Wel oghten we  to doon al oure entente
Lest that the feend  thurgh ydelnesse vs shente
ffor he  that with hise  thousand cordes slye
Continuelly  vs waiteth to biclappe
Whan he may man  in ydelnesse espye
He kan so lightly  cacche hym in his trappe
Til þat a man  be hent right by the lappe
He nys nat war  the feend hath hym in honde
Wel oghte vs werche  and ydelnesse withstonde
And though men dradden  neuere for to dye
Yet seen men wel  by reson doutelees
That ydelnesse  is roten slogardye
Of which ther neuere comth  no good nencrees
And seen  þat slouthe  it holdeth in a lees
Oonly to slepe  and for to ete and drynke
And to deuouren  al that othere swynke
  
And for to putte vs  fro swich ydelnesse
That cause is  of so greet confusion
I haue heer doon  my feithful bisynesse
After the legende  in translacion
Right of thy glorious lif and passion

WithInne the Cloistre blisful of thy sydis
Took mannes shape  the eterneel loue and pees

Assembled is in thee  magnificence
With mercy  goodnesse  and with swich pitee

Nat oonly  helpest hem that preyen thee
But often tyme  of thy benygnytee

Me flemed wrecche  in this desert of galle
Thynk on the womman Cananee  that sayde

And of thy light my soule in prison lighte

Of my body  and also by the wighte
Of erthely lust and fals affeccion
O hauene of refut o saluacion
Of hem  þat been in sorwe  and in distresse
Now helpe  for to my werk I wol me dresse

Of hym  that at the seintes reuerence

First wolde I  the name of seinte Cecile
Expowne  as men may in hir storie see
It is to seye in englissh  heuenes lilie
ffor pure chaastnesse of virginitee
Or  for she whitnesse hadde of honestee
And grene of Conscience  and of good fame
The soote favour lilie  was hir name
Or Cecilie is to seye  the wey to blynde
ffor she ensample was  by good techynge
Or elles Cecile  as I writen fynde
Is ioyned  by a manere conioynynge
Of heuene and lia  and heere in figurynge
The heuene is set for thoght of hoolynesse
And lia  for hire lastynge bisynesse
Cecile  may eek be seyd  in this manere
Wantynge of blyndnesse  for hir grete light
Of sapience  and for hire thewes cleere
Or elles loo  this maydens name bright
Of heuene and leos comth  for which by right
Men myghte hire wel  the heuene of peple calle
Ensample  of goode  and wise werkes alle
  
ffor leos  peple in englissh is to seye
And right as men may  in the heuene see
The sonne and moone  and sterres euery weye
Right so men goostly  in this mayden free
Syen of feith  the magnanymytee
And eek the cleernesse hool  of sapience
And sondry werkes  brighte  of excellence
And right so  as thise Philosophres write  
That heuene is swift and round  and eek brennynge
Right so  was faire Cecilie the white
fful swift and bisy  euere in good werkynge
And round and hool  in good perseuerynge
And brennynge euere  in charite ful brighte
Now haue I yow declared what she highte
This mayden bright Cecilie  as hir lif seith
Was comen of Romayns  and of noble kynde
And from hir Cradel  vp fostred in the feith
Of Crist and bar his gospel in hir mynde
She neuere cessed  as I writen fynde
Of hir preyere  and god to loue and drede
Bisekynge hym  to kepe hir maydenhede
And whan this mayden  sholde vnto a man
Ywedded be  that was ful yong of age
Which that ycleped was Valerian
And day was comen  of hir marriage
She ful devout and humble in hire corage
Vnder hir robe of gold  that sat ful faire
Hadde next hire flessh  yclad hire in an haire
  
And whil the Orgues  maden melodie
To god allone  in herte thus sang she
O lord  my soule  and eek my body gye
Vnwemmed  lest that it confounded be
And for his loue  that dyde  vpon a tree
Euery seconde  and thridde day she faste
Ay biddynge  in hire orisons ful faste
The nyght cam  and to bedde moste she gon
With hire housbonde  as ofte is the manere
And pryuely  to hym she seyde anon
O sweete  and wel biloued spouse deere
Ther is a conseil  and ye wolde it heere
Which that right fayn  I wolde vnto yow seye
So that ye swere  ye shul me nat biwreye
 Valerian  gan faste vnto hire swere  
That for no cas  ne thyng that myghte be
He sholde neuere mo  biwreyen here
And thanne at erst to hym thus seyde she
I haue an Aungel  which that loueth me
That with greet loue  wher so I wake or sleepe
Is redy ay  my body for to kepe
And if he  may feelen out of drede
That ye me touche  or loue in vileynye
He right anon  wol sle yow with the dede
And in youre yowthe  thus ye sholden dye
And if that ye  in clene loue me gye
He wol yow louen as me  for youre clennesse
And shewen yow  his ioye and his brightnesse
  
 Valerian  corrected  as god wolde
Answerde agayn  if I shal trusten thee
Lat me that Aungel se  and hym biholde
And if that it a verray Angel bee
Thanne wol I doon  as thou hast prayed me
And if thou loue  another man  for sothe
Right with this swerd thanne wol I sle yow bothe
Cecile answerde anon  right in this wise
If that yow list the Angel shul ye see
So þat ye trowe in Crist and yow baptize
Gooth forth  to Via Apia  quod shee
That fro this toun  ne stant but Miles three
And to the poure folkes  þat ther dwelle
Sey hem right thus  as that I shal yow telle
Telle hem  that I Cecile  yow to hem sente
To shewen yow  the goode Vrban the olde
ffor secree thynges  and for good entente
And whan that ye  Seint Vrban han biholde
Telle hym the wordes  whiche þat I to yow tolde
And whan þat he  hath purged yow fro synne
Thanne shul ye se  that Angel er ye twynne
 Valerian  is to the place ygon
And right as hym was taught by his lernynge
He foond this hooly  olde Vrban anon
Among the Seintes buryeles lotynge
And he anon  withouten tariynge
Dide his message  and whan þat he it tolde
Vrban for ioye  his handes gan vp holde
  
The teeris  from his eyen leet he falle  
Almyghty lord  o Ihesu Crist quod he
Sower of chast conseil  hierde of vs alle
The fruyt of thilke seed of Chastitee
That thou hast sowe in Cecile  taak to thee
Lo  lyk a bisy bee  withouten gile
Thee serueth ay  thyn owene thral Cecile
ffor thilke spouse  that she took right now
fful lyk a fiers leoun  she sendeth heere
As meke  as euere  was any lamb to yow
And with that word  anon ther gan appere
An oold man  clad in white clothes cleere
That hadde a book with lettre of gold in honde
And gan  bifore Valerian to stonde
Valerian as deed  fil doun for drede
Whan he hym saugh  and he vp hente hym tho
And on his book  right thus he gan to rede
O lord o feith o god withouten mo
O Cristendom  and fader of alle also
Abouen alle  ouer alle  euerywhere
Thise wordes  al with gold ywriten were
Whan this was rad  thanne seyde this olde man
Leeuestow this thyng or no  sey ye or nay
I leeue al this thyng  quod Valerian
ffor oother thyng than this  I dar wel say
Vnder the heuene  no wight thynke may
Tho vanysshed this olde man  he nyste where
And Pope Vrban  hym cristned right there
  
 Valerian gooth hoom  and fynt Cecilie
WithInne his chambre  with an Angel stonde
This Angel  hadde  of Roses and 1of lilie1
Corones two  the which he bar in honde
And first to Cecile  as I vnderstonde
He yaf that oon  and after gan he take
That oother  to Valerian hir make
With body clene  and with vnwemmed thoght
Kepeth ay wel  thise corones three
ffro Paradys to yow  haue I hem broght
Ne neuere mo  ne shal they roten bee
Ne lese hir soote sauour  trusteth me
Ne neuere wight shal seen hem with his eye
But he be chaast and hate vileynye
And thow Valerian  for thow so soone  
Assentedest to good conseil also
Sey what thee list and thou shalt han thy boone
I haue a brother  quod Valerian tho
That in this world  I loue no man so
I pray yow  that my brother may han grace
To knowe the trouthe  as I do in this place
 The Angel seyde  god liketh thy requeste
And bothe  with the palm of martirdom
Ye shullen come  vnto his blisful feste
And with that word  Tiburce his brother coom
And whan that he  the sauour vndernoom
Which that the Roses  and the lilies caste
WithInne his herte  he gan to wondre faste
  
And seyde  I wondre  this tyme of the yeer
Whennes  that soote sauour cometh so
Of Rose and lilies  that I smelle heer
ffor though I hadde hem  in myne handes two
The sauour  myghte in me no depper go
The sweete smel  þat in myn herte I fynde
Hath chaunged me  al in another kynde
 Valerian seyde  two corones  han we
Snow white and Rose reed  that shynen cleere
Whiche þat thyne eyen  han no myght to see
And as thou smellest hem  thurgh my preyere
So shaltow seen hem  leeue brother deere
If it so be  thou wolt withouten slouthe
Bileue aright and knowen verray trouthe
 Tiburce answerde  seistow this to me
In soothnesse  or in dreem I herkne this
In dremes quod valerian  han we be
Vnto this tyme  brother myn ywis
But now at erst in trouthe our dwellyng is
How woostow this quod Tiburce  in what wyse
Quod Valerian  that shal I thee deuyse
 The Aungel of god  hath me trouthe ytaught
Which thou shalt seen  if that thou wolt reneye
The ydoles and be clene  and elles naught
And of the myracle  of thise corones tweye
Seint Ambrose  in his preface list to seye
Solempnely  this noble doctour deere
Commendeth hym  and seith in this manere
  
 The palm of martirdom  for to receyue  
Seinte Cecile  fulfild of goddes yifte
The world  and eek hire chambre  gan she weyue
Witnesse  Tyburces  and Cecilies shrifte
To whiche  god of his bountee wolde shifte
Corones two  of floures wel smellynge
And made his Angel  hem the corones brynge
The mayde hath broght men  to blisse aboue
The world hath wist  what it is worth certeyn
Deuocion of Chastitee to loue
Tho shewed hym Cecile  al open and pleyn
That alle ydoles  nys but a thyng in veyn
ffor they been dombe  and therto they been deue
And charged hym  hise ydoles for to leue
Who so  that troweth nat this  a beest he is
Quod tho Tiburce  if þat I shal nat lye
And she gan kisse his brest that herde this
And was ful glad  he koude trouthe espye
This day  I take thee  for myn Allye
Seyde this blisful  faire mayde deere
And after that she seyde as ye may heere
 Lo  right so  as the loue of Crist quod she
Made me thy brotheres wyf right in that wise
Anon for myn Allyee  heer take I thee
Syn that thou wolt thyne ydoles despise
Go with thy brother now  and thee baptise
And make thee clene  so þat thou mowe biholde
The Angeles face  of which thy brother tolde
  
 Tiburce answerde  and seyde brother dere
ffirst tel me  whider þat I shal  and to what man
To whom quod he com forth  with right good cheere
I wol thee lede  vnto the Pope Vrban
Til Vrban brother myn Valerian
Quod tho Tiburce  woltow me thider lede
Me thynketh  that it were a wonder dede
Ne menestow nat Vrban  quod he tho
That is so ofte  dampned to be deed
And woneth in halkes  alwey to and fro
And dar nat ones  putte forth his heed
Men sholde hym brennen  in a fyr so reed
If he were founde  or þat men myghte hym spye
And we also  to bere hym compaignye
And whil we seken  thilke diuinitee  
That is yhid  in heuene pryuely
Algate  ybrend in this world shul we be
To whom Cecile  answerde boldely
Men myghten dreden  wel and skilfully
This lyf to lese  myn owene deere brother
If this were lyuynge oonly and noon oother
But ther is bettre lif in oother place
That neuere shal be lost ne drede thee noght
Which goddes sone  vs tolde thurgh his grace
That fadres sone  hath alle thyng ywroght
And al that wroght is  with a skilful thoght
The goost that fro the fader gan procede
Hath sowled hem  withouten any drede
  
By word and by myracle  goddes sone
Whan he was in this world declared heere
That ther was oother lyf ther men may wone
To whom answerde Tiburce  o suster deere
Ne seydestow right now  in this manere
Ther nys but o god  lord in soothfastnesse
And now of three  how maystow bere witnesse
 That shal I telle quod she  er I go
Right as a man  hath sapiences three
Memorie  Engyn  and Intellect also
So  in beynge  of diuinitee
Thre persones  may ther right wel bee
Tho gan she hym  ful bisily to preche
Of Cristes come  and of hise peynes teche
And many pointes  of his passion
How goddes sone  in this world was withholde
To doon mankynde  pleyn remission
That was ybounde in synne and cares colde
Al this thyng she vnto Tiburce tolde
And after this  Tiburce in good entente
With Valerian  to Pope Vrban he wente

That thanked god  and with glad herte and light
He cristned hym  and made hym in that place
Parfit in his lernynge  goddes knyght
And after this  Tiburce  gat swich grace
That euery day  he saugh in tyme and space
The Aungel of god  and euery maner boone
That he god axed  it was sped ful soone
  
 It were ful hard  by ordre for to seyn  
How manye wondres  Ihesus for hem wroghte
But atte laste  to tellen short and pleyn
The sergeantz  of the toun of Rome hem soghte
And hem  biforn Almache the Prefect broghte
Which hem opposed  and knew al hire entente
And to the ymage  of Iuppiter hem sente
And seyde  who so wol nat sacrifise
Swape of his heed  this my sentence heer
Anon thise martirs þat I yow deuyse
Oon Maximus  that was an Officer
Of the Prefectes  and his Corniculer
Hem hente  and whan he forth the Seintes ladde
Hym self he weepe  for pitee that he hadde
Whan Maximus  had herd the Seintes loore
He gat hym  of the tormentours leue
And ladde hem to his hous  withoute moore
And with hir prechyng er that it were eue
They gonnen  fro the tormentours to reue
And fro Maxime  and fro his folk echone
The false feith  to trowe in god allone
 Cecile cam  whan it was woxen nyght
With preestes  that hem cristned alle yfeere
And afterward  whan day was woxen light
Cecile hem seyde  with a ful stedefast cheere
Now Cristes owene knyghtes  leeue and deere
Cast alle awey  the werkes of derknesse
And Armeth yow  in Armure of brightnesse
  
Ye han for sothe  ydoon a greet bataille
Youre cours is doon  youre feith han ye conserued
Gooth to the corone of lif that may nat faille
The rightful Iuge  which þat ye han serued
Shal yeue it yow  as ye han it deserued
And whan this thyng was seyd  as I deuyse
Men ledde hem forth  to doon the sacrefise
But whan they weren  to the place broght
To tellen shortly  the conclusioun
They nolde encense  ne sacrifise right noght
But on hir knees  they setten hem adoun
With humble herte  and sad deuocioun
And losten  bothe hir heuedes in the place
Hir soules wenten  to the kyng of grace
This Maximus  that saugh this thyng bityde  
With pitous teeris  tolde it anon right
That he hir soules  saugh to heuene glyde
With Aungels  ful of cleernesse and of light
And with this word  conuerted many a wight
ffor which Almachius  dide hym so bete
With whippe of leed  til he the lif gan lete
 Cecile hym toook and buryed hym anon
By Tiburce  and Valerian softely
WithInne hire buriyng place vnder the stoon
And after this  Almachius hastily
Bad hise Ministres  fecchen openly
Cecile  so that she myghte in his presence
Doon sacrifice  and Iuppiter encense
  

But they conuerted  at hir wise loore
Wepten ful soore  and yauen ful credence
Vnto hire word and cryden moore and moore
Crist goddes sone  withouten difference
Is verray god  this is oure sentence
That hath so good a seruant hym to serue
This with o voys  we trowen  thogh we sterue
 Almachius  that herde of this doynge
Bad fecchen Cecile  that he myghte hire see
And alderfirst lo this was his axynge
What maner womman  artow quod he
I am a gentil womman born quod she
I axe thee quod he  though it thee greeue
Of thy Religion  and of thy bileeue
 Ye han bigonne  youre question folily
Quod she  that wolden two answeres conclude
In o demande  ye axed lewedly
Almache answerde  vnto that similitude
Of whennes comth  thyn answeryng so rude
Of whennes quod she  whan þat she was freyned
Of Conscience  and of good feith vnfeyned
 Almachius seyde  ne takestow noon heede
Of my power  and she answerde hym
Youre myght quod she  ful litel is to dreede
ffor euery  mortal  mannes power nys
But lyke a bladdre  ful of wynd ywys
ffor with a nedles poynt whan it is blowe
May al the boost of it be leyd ful lowe
  
 fful wrongfully  bigonne thow quod he  
And yet in wrong is thy perseuerance
Wostow nat how oure myghty princes free
Han thus comanded  and maad ordinance
That euery cristen wight shal han penance
But if that he  his cristendom withseye
And goon al quit if he wole it reneye
 Yowre princes erren  as youre nobleye dooth
Quod tho Cecile  and with a wood sentence
Ye make vs gilty  and  is nat sooth
ffor ye  that knowen wel oure Innocence
ffor as muche  as we doon a reuerence
To crist and for we bere a cristen name
Ye putte on vs  a cryme  and eek a blame
But we that knowen  thilke name so
ffor vertuous  we may it nat withseye
Almache answerde  chees oon of thise two
Do sacrifice  or cristendom reneye
That thou mowe now  escapen by that weye
At which  the hooly blisful faire mayde
Gan for to laughe  and to the Iuge sayde
 O Iuge  confus in thy nycetee
Woltow  that I reneye Innocence
To make me  a wikked wight quod she
Lo  he dissymuleth heere  in Audience
He stareth  and he woodeth in his Aduertence
To whom Almachius  vnsely wrecche
Ne woostow nat how far my myght may strecche
  
Han noght oure myghty princes  to me yeuen
Ye bothe power  and Auctoritee
To maken folk to dyen or to lyuen
Why spekestow  so proudly thanne to me
I speke noght  but stedfastly quod she
Nat proudly  for I speke as for my syde
We naten deedly  thilke vice of pryde

And if thou drede nat a sooth to heere
Thanne wol I shewe  al openly by right
That thou hast maad  a ful gret lesyng heere
Thou seyst thy Princes  han thee yeuen myght
Bothe for to sleen  and for to quyken a wight
Thou that ne mayst but oonly lyf bireue
Thou hast noon oother power ne no leue
But thou mayst seyn  thy princes han thee maked  
Ministre of deeth  for if thou speke of mo
Thou lyest for thy power is ful naked
Do wey thy booldnesse  seyde Almachius tho
And sacrifie to oure goddes er thou go
I recche nat what wrong þat thou me profre
ffor I can suffre it  as a Philosophre
 But thilke wronges  may I nat endure
That thou spekest of oure goddes heere quod he
Cecile answerde  o nyce creature
Thou seydest no word  syn thou spak to me
That I ne knew ther with  thy nycetee
And that thou were  in euery maner wise
A lewed Officer  and a veyn Iustise
  

Ther lakketh no thyng to thyne outter eyen
That thou nart blynd  for thyng þat we seen alle
That it is stoon  þat men may wel espyen
That ilke stoon  a god thow wolt it calle
I rede thee  lat thyn hand vp on it falle
And taste it wel  and stoon thou shalt it fynde
Syn that thou seest nat with thyne eyen blynde
It is a shame  that the peple shal
So scorne thee  and laughe at thy folye
ffor communly  men woot it wel oueral
That myghty god  is in hise heuenes hye
And thise ymages  wel thou mayst espye
To thee  ne to hem self ne mowen noght profite
ffor in effect they been nat worth a myte
 Thise wordes  and swiche othere seyde she
And he weex wrooth  and bad men sholde hir lede
Hom til hir house  and in hire hous quod he
Brenne hire  right in a bath of flambes rede
And as he bad  right so was doon in dede
ffor in a Bath  they gonne hire faste shetten
And nyght and day  greet fyre they vnder betten
 The longe nyght  and eek a day also
ffor al the fyr  and eek the bathes heete
She sat al coold  and feeled no wo
It made hire  nat a drope for to sweete
But in that Bath  hir lyf she moste lete
ffor he Almachius  with a ful wikke entente
To sleen hire in the Bath his sonde sente
  
Thre strokes in the nekke  he smoot hire tho  
The tormentour  but for no maner chaunce
He myghte noght smyte  al hir nekke atwo
And for ther was  that tyme an ordinaunce
That no man  sholde doon men swich penaunce
The ferthe strook to smyten softe or soore
This tormentour  ne dorste do namoore
But half deed  with hir nekke ycoruen there
He lefte hir lye  and on his wey he went
The cristen folk  which that aboute hire were
With sheetes  han the blood  ful faire yhent
Thre dayes lyued she  in this torment
And neuere cessed  hem the feith to teche
That she hadde fostred  hem she gan to preche
And hem she yaf  hir moebles  and hir thyng
And to the Pope Vrban  bitook hem tho
And seyde  I axed this at heuene kyng
To han respit thre dayes and namo
To recomende to yow  er that I go
Thise soules lo  and þat I myghte do werche
Heere of myn hous  perpetuelly a cherche
 Seint Vrban  with hise deknes priuely
This body fette  and buryed it by nyghte
Among hise othere seintes  honestly
Hir hous  the chirche of seinte Cecilie highte
Seint Vrban halwed it  as he wel myghte
In which  in to this day  in noble wyse
Men doon to Crist and to his seinte seruyse
Whan toold was al the lyf  of seinte Cecile
Er we hadde riden  fully fyue Mile
At Boghton vnder Blee  vs gan atake
A man  that clothed was  in clothes blake
And vndernethe  he wered a surplys
His hakeney  which þat was al pomely grys
So swatte  that it wonder was to see
It semed  as he had priked Miles three
The hakeney eek  þat his yeman rood vpon
So swatte  that vnnethe myghte it gon
    
    
A Male tweyfoold  vp on his croper lay  
It semed  that he caried lite array
Al light for Somer  rood this worthy man
And in myn herte  to wondren I bigan
What þat he was  til that I vnderstood
How that his cloke  was sowed to his hood
ffor which  whan I hadde longe auysed me
I demed hym  som Chanon for to be
His hat heeng  at his bak  doun by a laas
ffor he hadde riden  moore than trot or paas
He hadde ay priked lik as he were wood
A Clote leef  he hadde vnder his hood
ffor swoot and for to kepe his heed from heete
But it was ioye  for to seen hym swete
His forheed dropped  as a stillatorie
Were ful of Plantayne  and of Paritorie
  
And whan that he was come  he gan to crye
God saue quod he  this ioly compaignye
ffaste haue I priked quod he  for youre sake
By cause  that I wolde yow atake
To riden  in som myrie compaignye
His yeman eek was ful of curteisye
And seyde sires  now in the morwe tyde
Out of youre hostelrie  I saugh you ryde
And warned heer  my lord and my souerayn
Which  to ryden with yow  is ful fayn
ffor his desport he loueth daliance
 ffreend  for thy warnyng god yeue thee chance
Thanne seyde oure hoost for certein  it wolde seme
Thy lord were wys  and so I may wel deme
He is ful iocunde also  dar I leye
Can he oght telle  a myrie tale or tweye
With which  he glade may this compaignye
 Who sire  my lord ye  ye withouten lye
He kan of murthe  and eek of Iolitee
Nat but ynough  also sire trusteth me
And ye hym knewe  as wel as do I
Ye wolde wondre  how wel and craftily
He koude werke  and that in sondry wise
He hath take on hym  many a greet emprise
Which were ful hard  for any that is heere
To brynge aboute  but they of hym it leere
As hoomely  as he rit amonges yow
If ye hym knewe  it wolde be for youre prow
Ye wolde nat forgoon his Aqueyntaunce
ffor muchel good  I dar leye in balaunce
Al that I haue  in my possessioun
He is a man  of heigh discrecioun
I warne yow wel  he is a passyng man  
 Wel quod oure hoost I pray thee tel me than
Is he a clerk  or noon telle what he is
 Nay  he is gretter than a clerk ywis
  
Seyde this yeman  and in wordes fewe
Hoost of his craft som what I wol yow shewe
 I seye  my lord  kan swich subtilitee
But al his craft  ye may nat wite for me
And som what helpe I yet to his wirkyng
That al this ground  on which we been ridyng
Til that we come  to Caunterbury toun
He koude al clene  turne it vp so doun
And paue it  al of siluer  and of gold
 And whan this yeman  hadde this tale ytold
Vnto oure hoost he seyde benedicitee
This thyng is wonder merueillous to me
Syn that thy lord  is of so heigh prudence
By cause of which  men sholde hym reuerence
That of his worshipe  rekketh he so lite
His ouerslope  nys nat worth a myte
As in effect to hym  so moot I go
It is al baudy  and totore also
Why is thy lord so sluttissh I the preye
And is of power bettre clooth to beye
If that his dede  accorde with thy speche
Telle me that  and that I thee biseche
 Why quod this yeman wherto axe ye me
God help me so  for he shal neuere thee
But I wol nat auowe that I seye
And therfore  keepe it secree I yow preye
He is to wys  in feith  as I bileeue
That that is ouerdoon  it wol nat preeue
Aright as clerkes seyn  it is a vice
Wherfore in that I holde hym lewed and nyce
ffor whan a man  hath ouer greet a wit
fful oft hym happeth  to mysusen it
So dooth my lord  and that me greueth soore
God it amende  I kan sey yow namoore
 Therof no fors  good yeman  quod oure hoost
Syn of the konnyng of thy lord thow woost
  
Telle how he dooth  I pray thee hertely
Syn that he is  so crafty and so sly
Where dwelle ye  if it to telle be
 In the suburbes  of a toun quod he
Lurkynge in hernes  and in lanes blynde
Where as thise robbours  and thise theues by kynde
Holden  hir pryuee fereful residence
As they  that dar nat shewen hir presence
So faren we  if I shal seye the sothe  
 Now quod oure hoost  lat me telle to the
Why artow  so discoloured of thy face
 Peter quod he  god yeue it harde grace
I am so vsed  in the fyr to blowe
That it hath chaunged my colour I trowe
I am nat wont in no Mirour to prie
But swynke soore  and lerne multiplie
We blondren euere  and pouren in the fir
And for al that  we faille of oure desir
ffor euere we lakke  of oure conclusion
To muchel folk  we doon illusion
And borwe gold  be it a pound or two
Or ten  or twelue  or manye sommes mo
And make hem  wenen at the leeste weye
That of a pound  we koude make tweye
Yet is it fals  but ay we han good hope
It for to doon  and after it we grope
But that science  is so fer vs biforn
We mowen nat al though we hadden sworn
It ouertake  it slit awey so faste
It wole  vs maken beggers atte laste
 Whil this yeman  was thus in his talkyng
This Chanon drough hym neer  and herde al thyng
Which this yeman spak  for suspecion
Of mennes speche  euere hadde this Chanon
ffor Caton seith  that he that gilty is
Demeth alle thyng be spoke of hym ywis
  
That was the cause  he gan so ny hym drawe
To his yeman  to herknen al his sawe
And thus he seyde  vnto his yeman tho
Hoold thou thy pees  and spek no wordes mo
ffor if thou do  thou shalt it deere abye
Thou sclaundrest me  heere in this compaignye
And eek discouerest that thou sholdest hyde
 Ye quod our hoost  telle on what so bityde
Of al his thretyng rekke nat a myte
 In feith quod he  namoore I do but lyte
 And whan this Chanon  saugh it wolde nat be
But his yeman  wolde telle his pryuetee
He fledde awey  for verray sorwe and shame
 A quod the yeman  heere shal arise game
Al that I kan  anon now wol I telle
Syn he is goon  the foule feend hym quelle
ffor neuere heer  wol I with hym meete
ffor peny ne for pound  I yow biheete
He that me broghte first vnto that game
Er that he dye  sorwe haue he and shame
ffor it is  ernest to me by my feith  
That feele I wel  what that any man seith
And yet for al my smert and al my grief
ffor al my sorwe  labour  and meschief
I koude neuere leue it  in no wise
Now wolde god  my wit myghte suffise
To tellen  al that longeth  to that Art
And naþelees  yow wol I tellen part
Syn that my lord is goon  I wol nat spare
Swich thyng as that I knowe  I wol declare
With this Chanon  I dwelt haue seuen yeer
And of his science  am I neuer the neer
Al that I hadde  I haue lost therby
And god woot so hath many mo than I
Ther I was wont to be right fressh and gay
Of clothyng and of oother good array
Now may I were  an hose vpon myn heed
And wher my colour  was bothe fressh and reed
Now is it wan  and of leden hewe
Who so it vseth  soore shal he rewe
And of my swynk  yet blered is myn eye
Lo  which auantage  is to multiplie
That slidynge science  hath me maad so bare
That I haue no good  wher þat euere I fare
And yet I am endetted so therby
Of gold  that I haue borwed trewely
That whil I lyue  I shal it quite neuere
Lat euery man  be war by me for euere
What maner man  that casteth hym ther to
If he continue  I holde his thrift ydo
ffor so helpe me god  therby shal he nat wynne
But empte his purs  and make hise wittes thynne
And whan he  thurgh his madnesse and folye
Hath lost his owene good  thurgh Iupartye
Thanne he exciteth  oother folk  therto
To lesen hir good  as he hym self hath do
ffor vnto shrewes  ioye it is and ese
To haue hir felawes  in peyne and disese
  
Thus was I  ones lerned of a Clerk
Of that no charge  I wol speke of oure werk
 Whan we been there  as we shul excercise
Oure Eluysshe craft we semen wonder wise
Oure termes  been so clergial  and so queynte  
I blowe the fir  til that myn herte feynte
What sholde I tellen eche proporcion
Of thynges  whiche þat we werche vpon
As on fyue  or sixe Ounces  may wel be
Of siluer  or som oother quantitee
And bisye me  to telle yow the names
Of Orpyment brent bones  Iren Squames
That into poudre  grounden been ful smal
And in an erthen pot put is al
And salt yput In  and also papeer
Biforn thise poudres  that I speke of heer
And wel ycouered  with a lampe of glas
And muchel oother thyng  which þat ther was
And of the pot and glasses enlutyng
That of the Eyr myghte passe out no thyng
And of the esy fir  and smart also
Which that was maad  and of the care and wo
That we hadden  in oure matires sublymyng
And in Almalgamyng and calceniyng
Of quyk siluer  yclept Mercurie crude
ffor alle our sleightes  we kan nat conclude
Oure Orpyment and sublymed Mercurie
Oure grounden litarge eek in the Prfurie
And ech of thise  of Ounces a certeyn
Noght helpeth vs  oure labour is in veyn
Ne eek oure spirites Ascencioun
Ne oure matires  þat lyen al fix adoun
Mowe in oure werkyng no thyng vs auaille
ffor lost is  al oure labour and trauaille
And al the cost a twenty deuel way
Is lost also  which we vpon it lay
  
 Ther is also  ful many another thyng
That is  vnto oure craft apertenyng
Though I by ordre  hem nat reherce kan
By cause  that I am a lewed man
yet wol I telle hem  as they come to mynde
Thogh I ne kan nat sette hem in hir kynde
As Boole  armonyak vertgrees  Boras
And sondry vessels  maad of erthe and glas
Oure vrynals  and our descensories
Violes  crosletz  and sublymatories
Cucurbites  and Alambikes eek
And othere swiche  deere ynough a leek
Nat nedeth it for to reherce hem alle
Watres rubifiyng and Boles galle
Arsenyk  sal Armonyak and Brymstoon
And herbes  koude I telle eek many oon
As Egremoyne  Valerian  and lunarie  
And othere swiche  if that me liste tarie
Oure lampes brennyng bothe nyght and day
To brynge aboute  oure purpos  if we may
Oure fourneys eek  of Calcinacion
And of watres Albificacion

Cered pottes  sal Peter  vitriole
And diuerse fires  maad of wode and cole
Sal tartre  Alkaly  and sal preparat
And combust matires  and coagulat
Cley  maad with hors  and mannes heer and oille
Of Tartre  Alum glas  berme  wort and argoille

And eek of oure matires encorporyng
And of oure siluer citrinacion
And of oure cementyng and fermentacion
Oure yngottes  testes  and many mo
I wol yow telle  as was me taught also
  
The seuene spirites  and the bodies seuene
By ordre  as ofte I herde my lord hem neuene
 The firste spirit quyk siluer called is
The seconde Orpyment the thridde ywis
Sal Armonyak  and the ferthe Brymstoon
The bodyes seuene eek lo hem heere anoon
 Sol gold is  and Luna  siluer we threpe
Mars Iren  Mercurie quyk siluer we clepe
Saturnus leed  and Iuppiter is tyn
And Venus Coper  by my fader kyn
 This cursed craft who so wole excercise
He shal no good han  þat hym may suffise
ffor al the good  he spendeth ther aboute
He lese shal  therof haue I no doute
Who that listeth  outen his folie
Lat hym come forth  and lerne multiplie
And euery man  that oght hath in his cofre
Lat hym appiere  and wexe a Philosophre
Ascauns  that craft is so light to leere
Nay nay god woot al be he Monk or frere
Preest or Chanon  or any oother wyght
Though he sitte at his book bothe day and nyght
In lernyng of this Eluysshe nyce loore
Al is in veyn  and parde muchel moore
To lerne a lewed man this subtiltee
ffy spek nat therof  for it wol nat bee
And konne he letterure  or konne he noon
As in effect he shal fynde it al oon
ffor bothe  two  by my sauacion  
Concluden in multiplicacion
Ylike wel  whan they han al ydo
This is to seyn  they faillen bothe two
Yet forgat I  to maken rehersaille
Of watres corosif  and of lymaille
And of bodies mollificacion
And also  of hire induracion
  
Oilles  Ablucions  and metal fusible
To tellen al  wolde passen any Bible
That owher is  wherfore as for the beste
Of alle thise names  now wol I me reste
ffor as I trowe  I haue yow toold ynowe
To reyse a feend  al looke he neuer so rowe
 A nay lat be  the Philosophres stoon
Elixer clept we sechen faste echoon
ffor hadde we hym  thanne were it siker ynow
But vnto god of heuene  I make avow
ffor al oure craft whan we han al ydo
With al oure sleighte  he wol nat come vs to
He hath maad vs spenden muchel good
ffor sorwe of which  almoost we wexen wood
But that good hope  crepeth in oure herte
Supposynge  though we sore smerte
To be releeued  by hym afterward
Swich supposyng and hope  is sharpe and hard
I warne yow wel  it is to seken euere
That futur temps  hath maad men disseuere
In trust therof  from al þat euere they hadde
Yet of that Art they kan nat wexen sadde
ffor vnto hem  it is a bitter sweete
So semeth it for nadde they but a sheete
Which þat they myghte wrappe hem Inne at nyght
And a brat to walken Inne by day lyght
They wolde hem selle  and spenden on the craft
They kan nat stynte  til no thyng be laft
And eueremoore  where þat euere they goon
Men may hem knowe  by smel of Brymstoon
ffor al the world  they stynken as a goot
Hir sauour  is so rammyssh and so hoot
That though a man  a Mile from hem be
The sauour wole infecte hym truste me
And thus by smel  and threedbare array
If þat men liste  this folk they knowe may
  
And if a man  wole aske hem pryuely
Why they been clothed  so vnthriftily
They right anon  wol rownen in his ere
And seyn  þat if þat they espied were
Men wolde hem slee  by cause of hir science  
Lo  thus  this folk bitrayen Innocence
Passe ouer this  I go my tale vnto
Er þat the pot be on the fir ydo
Of metals  with a certeyn quantitee
My lord hem tempreth  and no man but he
Now he is goon  I dare seyn boldely
ffor as men seyn  he kan doon craftily
Algate I woot wel  he hath swich a name
And yet ful oft  he renneth in a blame
And wite ye how  ful ofte it happeth so
The pot tobreketh  and farewel al is go
Thise Metals  been of so greet violence
Oure walles  mowe nat make hem resistence
But if they weren wroght of lym and stoon
They percen so  and thurgh the wal they goon
And somme of hem  synke in to the ground
Thus han we lost by tymes many a pound
And somme are scatered  al the floor aboute
Somme lepte into the roof withouten doute
Though þat the feend  noght in oure sighte hym shewe
I trowe he with vs be  that ilke shrewe
In helle  where þat he lord is and sire
Nis ther moore wo  ne moore rancour ne Ire
Whan that oure pot is broke  as I haue sayd
Euery man chit and halt hym yuele apayd
 Somme seyde  it was along on the fir makyng
Somme seyde nay  it was on the blowyng
Thanne was I fered  for that was myn office
 Straw quod the thridde  ye been lewed and nyce
It was nat tempred as it oghte be
 Nay quod the fourthe  stynt and herkne me
  
By cause our fir  ne was nat maad of Beech
That is the cause  and oother noon so theech
I kan nat telle  wheron it was along
But wel I woot greet strif vs is among
 What quod my lord  ther is namoore to doone
Of thise perils  I wol be war eft soone
I am right siker that the pot was crased
Be as be may  be ye no thyng amased
As vsage is  lat swepe the floor as swithe
Plukke vp youre hertes  and beeth glad and blithe
 The Mullok on an heepe  sweped was
And on the floor  ycast a Canevas
And al this Mullok in a syve ythrowe
And sifted  and ypiked many a throwe
 Pardee quod oon  somwhat of oure metal
Yet is ther heere  though þat we han nat al
Al though this thyng myshapped haue as now  
Another tyme  it may be wel ynow
Vs moste putte  oure good in auenture
A Marchant pardee  may nat ay endure
Trusteth me wel  in his prosperitee
Somtyme his good  is drenched in the see
And somtyme  comth it sauf  vnto the londe
 Pees quod my lord  the nexte tyme I shal fonde
To bryngen oure craft  al in another plite
And but I do  lat me han the wite
Ther was defaute in som what wel I woot
 Another seyde  the fir was ouer hoot
And be it hoot or coold  I dar seye this
That we concluden  eueremoore amys
We faille of that  which þat we wolden haue
And in oure madnesse  eueremoore we raue
And whan we been  togidres euerichoon
Euery man  semeth a Salomon
But euery thyng which þat seineth as the gold
Nis nat gold  as þat I haue herd told
  
Ne euery appul  that is fair to eye
Nis nat good  what so men clappe or crye
 Right so  fareth it amonges vs
He þat semeth the wiseste by Ihesus
Is moost fool  whan it comth to the preef
And he þat semeth trewest is a theef
That shul ye knowe  er þat I fro yow wende
By that I of my tale haue maad an ende
Ther was  a Chanon of Religioun
Amonges vs  wolde infecte al a toun
Thogh it as greet were  as was Nynyuee
Rome  Alisaundre  Troye  and othere three
His sleighte  and his infinit falsnesse
Ther koude no man  writen as I gesse
Though þat he lyue myghte a thousand yeer
In al this world  of falshede nas his peer
ffor in hise termes  so he wolde hym wynde
And speke hise wordes  in so sly a kynde
Whanne he commune shal with any wight
That he wol make hym doten anon right
But it a feend be  as hym seluen is
fful many a man  hath he bigiled er this
And wole  if that he lyue may a while
And yet men ride and goon ful many a Mile
Hym for to seke  and haue his Aqueyntaunce  
Noght knowynge  of his false gouernaunce
And if yow list to yeue me Audience
I wol it telle heere  in youre presence
 But worshipful Chanons Religious
Ne demeth nat that I desclaundre youre hous
Although that my tale  of a Chanoun bee
Of euery ordre  som shrewe is pardee
And god forbede  that al a compaignye
Sholde rewe  o singuleer mannes folye
To sclaundre yow  is no thyng myn entente
But to correcten  that is mys Imente
  
This tale  was nat oonly  toold for yow
But eek  for othere mo  ye woot wel how
That among cristes Apostles twelue
Ther nas no traytour but Iudas hym selue
Thanne  why sholde al the remenant haue a blame
That giltlees were  by yow I seye the same
Saue oonly this  if ye wol herkne me
If any Iudas  in youre Couent be
Remoeueth hym bitymes  I yow rede
If shame  or los  may causen any drede
And beeth no thyng displesed I yow preye
But in this cas  herketh what I shal seye
IN London  was a preest Annueleer
That therInne  had dwelled many a yeer
Which was so plesaunt and so seruysable
Vnto the wyf  where as he was at table
That she wolde suffre hym no thyng for to paye
ffor bord ne clothyng wente he neuer so gaye
And spendyng siluer  hadde he right ynow
Therof no fors  I wol procede as now
And telle forth my tale  of the Chanon
That broghte this preest to confusion
 This false Chanon  cam vp on a day
Vnto this preestes chambre  wher he lay
Bisechynge hym  to lene hym a certeyn
Of gold  and he wolde quite it hym ageyn
Leene me a marc quod he  but dayes three
And at my day  I wol it quiten thee
And if so be  that thow me fynde fals
Another day  do hange me by the hals
 This preest hym took a marc and that as swithe
And this Chanoun  hym thanked ofte sithe
And took his leue  and wente forth his weye
And at the thridde day  broghte his moneye
And to the preest  he took his gold agayn
Wherof this preest was wonder glad and fayn
  
 Certes quod he  no thyng anoyeth me  
To lene a man  a noble  or two  or thre
Or what thyng  were in my possession
Whan he  so trewe is of condicion
That in no wise  he breke wole his day
To swich a man  I kan neuer seye nay
 What quod this Chanoun  sholde I be vntrewe
Nay that were a thyng yfallen al of newe
Trouthe is a thyng that I wol euere kepe
In to that day  in which that I shal crepe
In to my graue  or ellis god forbede
Bileueth this  as siker as the Crede
God thanke I  and in good tyme  be it sayd
That ther was neuere man yet yuele apayd
ffor gold ne siluer  that he to me lente
Ne neuere falshede  in myn herte I mente
And sire quod he  now of my pryuetee
Syn ye so goodlich  han been vnto me
And kithed to me  so greet gentillesse
Somwhat to quyte with youre kyndenesse
I wol yow shewe  if that yow list to leere
I wol yow teche  pleynly the manere
How I kan werken  in Philosophie
Taketh good heede  ye shul wel seen at eye
That I wol doon  a maistrie er I go
 Ye quod the preest ye sire quod he  and wol ye so
Marie  therof  I pray yow hertely
 At youre comandement sire trewely
Quod the Chanon  and ellis god forbeede
 Loo how this theef koude his seruice beede
fful sooth it is  that swich profred seruyse
Stynketh  as witnessen thise olde wyse
And that ful soone  I wol it verifie
In this Chanon  roote of alle trecherie
That euere moore  delit hath and gladnesse
Swiche feendly thoughtes  in his herte impresse
  
How Cristes peple  he may to meschief  brynge
God kepe vs  from his false dissymulynge
 Noght wiste this preest with whom þat he delt
N of his harm comynge  he no thyng felte
O sely preest  o sely Innocent
With coueitise  anon thou shalt be blent
O gracelees  ful blynd is thy conceite
No thyng ne artow war of the deceite
Which that this fox  yshapen hath for thee
Hise wily wrenches  thou ne mayst nat flee
Wherfore to go  to the conclusion
That refereth  to thy confusion
Vnhappy man  anon I wol me hye  
To tellen thyn vnwit  and his folye
And eek the falsnesse  of that oother wrecche
As ferforth  as my konnyng may strecche
This Chanon was my lord  ye wolden weene
Sire hoost in feith  and by the heuenes queene
It was another Chanon  and nat hee
That kan an hundred foold moore subtiltee
He hath bitrayed folkes many tyme
Of his falshede  it dulleth me to ryme
Euere whan þat I speke  of his falshede
ffor shame of hym  my chekes wexen rede
Algates  they bigynnen for to glowe
ffor reednesse haue I noon  right wel I knowe
In my visage  for fumes diuerse
Of metals  whiche ye han herd me reherce
Consumed  and wasted han my reednesse
Now taak heede  of this Chanons cursednesse
 Sire quod he to the preest lat youre man gon
ffor quyk siluer  that we hadde it anon
And lat hym  bryngen Ounces two or three
And whan he comth  as faste shal ye see
A wonder thyng which ye saugh neuere er this
 Sire quod the preest it shal be doon ywis
  
He bad his seruant fecchen hym this thyng
And he al redy  was at his biddyng
And wente hym forth  and cam anon agayn
With this quyk siluer  soothly for to sayn
And toke thise Ounces thre  to the Chanoun
And he hem leyde  faire and wel adoun
And bad the seruant coles for to brynge
That he anon  myghte go to his werkynge
 The coles  right anon weren yfet
And this Chanon  took out a Crosselet
Of his bosom  and shewed it to the preest
This Instrument quod he  which þat thou seest
Taake in thyn hand  and put thy self ther Inne
Of this quyk siluer an Ounce  and heer bigynne
In the name of Crist to wexe a philosofre
Ther been ful fewe  to whiche I wolde profre
To shewen hem  thus muche of my science
ffor ye shul seen  heer by experience
That this quyk siluer  wol I mortifye
Right in youre sighte anon  I wol nat lye
And make as good siluer  and as fyn
As ther is any  in youre purse or myn
Or elleswhere  and make it malliable
And elles  holdeth me  fals and vnable
Amonges folk for euere to appeere  
I haue a poudre heer  þat coste me deere
Shal make al good  for it is cause of al
My konnyng  which þat I to yow shewen shal
Voyde youre man  and lat hym be ther oute
And shette the dore  whils we been aboute
Oure pryuetee  that no man vs espie
Whils that we werke  in this Philosophie
 Al as he bad  fulfilled was in dede
This ilke seruant anonright out yede
And his Maister  shette the dore anon
And to hire labour spedily they gon
  
 This preest at this cursed Chanons biddyng
Vp on the fir anon sette this thyng
And blew the fir  and bisyed hym ful faste
And this Chanon  into the Crosselet cast
A poudre noot I wher of  that it was
Ymaad  ouþer of chalk or of glas
Or som what elles  was nat worth a flye
To blynde with the preest and bad hym hye
The coles  for to couchen al aboue
The Crosselet for in tokenyng I thee loue
Quod this Chanon  thyne owene handes two
Shul werche al thyng which shal heer be do
 Graunt mercy quod the preest and was ful glad
And couched cole  as that Chanon bad
And while he bisy was  this feendly wrecche
This false Chanoun  the foule feend hym fecche
Out of his bosom  he took a Bechen cole
In which ful subtilly  was maad an hole
And therInne  put was of siluer lemaille
An Ounce  and stopped was withouten faille
The hole with wex  to kepe the lemaille In
And vnderstondeth  that this false gyn
Was nat maad ther  but it was maad bifore
And othere thynges  I shal tellen moore
Herafterward  whiche þat he with hym broghte
Er he cam there  hym to bigile he thoghte
And so he dide  er þat they wente atwynne
Til he had terned hym  he koude nat blynne
It dulleth me  whan that I of hym speke
On his falshede  fayn wolde I me wreke
If I wiste how  but he is heere and there
He is so variaunt  þat he abit nowhere
 But taketh heede  now sires for goddes loue
He took this cole  of which I spak aboue
And in his hand  he baar it pryuely
And whils the preest couched bisily
  
The coles  as I tolde yow er this  
This Chanon seyde  freend ye doon amys
This is nat couched  as it oghte be
But soone  I shal amenden it quod he
Now lat me medle therwith  but a while
ffor of yow  haue I pitee by seint Gile
Ye been right hoot I se wel how ye swete
Haue heer a clooth  and wipe awey the wete
And whils þat the preest wiped his face
This Chanon  took his cole with harde grace
And leyde it aboue  vp on the myddeward
Of the Crosselet and blew wel afterward
Til that the coles  gonne faste brenne
 Now yeue vs drynke  quod the Chanon thenne
As swithe al shal be wel I vndertake
Sitte we doun  and lat vs myrie make
And whan þat  this Chanones Bechen cole
Was brent al the lemaille out of the hole
Into the Crosselet fil anon adoun
And so it moste nedes by resoun
Syn it so euene  abouen it couched was
But therof  wiste the preest no thyng alas
He demed alle the coles yliche good
ffor of that sleighte  he no thyng vnderstood
And whan this Alkamystre saugh his tyme
Ris vp quod he sire preest and sit by me
And for I woot wel  Ingot haue I noon
Gooth walketh forth and brynge vs a Chalk stoon
ffor I wol make oon  of the same shape
That is an Ingot if I may han hape
And bryngeth eek with yow  a bolle or a panne
fful of water  and ye shul se wel thanne
How þat oure bisynesse  shal thryue and preeue
And yet for ye shul han no mysbileeue
Ne wrong conceite of me  in youre Absence
I ne wol nat been out of youre presence
  
But go with yow  and come with yow ageyn
The chambre dore  shortly for to seyn
They opened and shette  and wente hir weye
And forth with hem  they carieden the keye
And coome agayn  withouten any delay
What sholde I tarien  al the longe day
He took the Chalk  and shoope it in the wise
Of an Ingot as I shal yow deuyse
 I seye  he took out of his owene sleeue
A teyne of siluer  yuele moot he cheeue
Which þat was nat  but an Ounce of weighte
And taak heede now  of his cursed sleighte
 He shoope his Ingot in lengthe and eek in breede  
Of this teyne  withouten any drede
So slyly  that the preest it nat espide
And in his sleue  agayn he gan it hide
And fro the fir he took vp his mateere
And in thyngot putte it with myrie cheere
And in the water vessel  he it caste
Whan þat hym luste  and bad the preest as faste
What þat heer is  put In thin hand and grope
Thow fynde shalt ther siluer as I hope

        
He putte his hand In  and took vp a teyne
Of siluer fyn  and glad in euery veyne
Was this preest whan he saugh it was so
Goddes blessyng and his moodres also
And alle halwes  have ye sire Chanon
Seyde this preest and I hir malison
But and ye vouchesauf to techen me
This noble craft and this subtiltee
I wol be youre  in al that euere I may
 Quod the preest yet wol I make assay
The seconde tyme  þat ye may taken heede
And been expert of this  and in youre neede
  
Another day  assaye in myn absence
This disciplyne  and this crafty science
Lat take another Ounce  quod he tho
Of quyk siluer  withouten wordes mo
And do ther with  as ye han doon er this
With that oother  which þat now siluer is
 This preest hym bisieth  in al þat he kan
To doon  as this Chanon  this cursed man
Comanded hym  and faste he blew the fir
ffor to come  to theffect of his desir
And this Chanon  right in the meene while
Al redy was  the preest eft to bigile
And for a contenance  in his hand he bar
An holwe stikke  taak kepe and be war
In the ende of which  an Ounce and namoore
Of siluer lemaille  put was as bifore
In his cole  and stopped with wex weel
ffor to kepe In  his lemaille euery deel
And whil this preest was in his bisynesse
This Chanon  with his stikke gan hym dresse
To hym anon  and his poudre caste In
As he dide er  the deuel  out of his skyn
Hym terve  I pray to god  for his falshede
ffor he was euere fals  in thoght and dede
And with this stikke  aboue the Crosselet
That was ordeyned  with that false Iet
He stired the coles  til relente gan  
The wex agayn the fir  as euery man
But it a fool be  woot wel it moot nede
And al that in the stikke was out yede
And in the crosselet hastily it fel
 Now good sires  what wol ye bet than wel
Whan þat this preest thus was bigiled ageyn
Supposynge noght but treuthe sooth to seyn
He was so glad  that I ne kan nat expresse
In no manere  his myrthe and his gladnesse
  
And to the Chanon  he profred eftsoone
Body and good  ye quod the Chanon soone
Though poure I be  crafty thou shalt me fynde
I warne thee  yet is ther moore bihynde
 Is ther any coper her Inne seyde he
 Ye quod the preest sire I trowe wel ther be
 Elles go bye vs som  and that as swithe
Now good sire  go forth thy wey and hy the
 He wente his wey  and with the coper cam
And this Chanon  it in hise handes nam
And of that coper  weyed out but an Ounce
 Al to symple  is my tonge to pronounce
As Ministre of my wit the doublenesse
Of this Chanon  roote of alle cursednesse
He semed freendly  to hem  þat knewe hym noght
But he was feendly  bothe in herte and thoght
It weerieth me  to telle of his falsnesse
And nathelees  yet wol I it expresse
To thentente  that men may be war therby
And for noon oother cause trewely
 He putte the Ounce of Coper in the Crosselet
And on the fir  as swithe he hath it set
And caste In poudre  and made the preest to blowe
And in his werkyng for to stoupe lowe
As he dide er  and al nas but a Iape
Right as hym liste  the preest he made his Ape
And afterward  in the Ingot he it caste
And in the panne  putte it at the laste
Of the water  In he putte his owene hand
And in his sleue  as ye biforn hand
Herde me telle  hadde a siluer teyne
He slyly tooke it out this cursed heyne
Vnwityng this preest of his false craft
And in the pannes botme  he hath it laft
And in the water  rombled to and fro
And wonder pryuely  took vp also
  
The coper teyne  noght knowynge this preest
And hidde it and hym hente by the breest
And to hym spak and thus seyde in his game  
Stoupeth adoun  by god ye be to blame
Helpeth me now  as a dide yow whil eer
Putte In youre hand  and looketh what is theer
 This preest took vp  this siluer teyne anon
And thanne seyde the Chanon  lat vs gon
With thise thre teynes  whiche þat we han wroght
To som Goldsmyth  and wite if they been ouht
ffor by my feith  I nolde for myn hood
But if that they were siluer fyn and good
And that as swithe  preeued it shal bee
 Vnto the Goldsmyth  with thise teynes three
They wente  and putte thise teynes in Assay
To fir and hamer  myghte no man seye nay
But þat they weren  as hem oghte be
 This sotted preest who was gladder than he
Was neuere brid  gladder agayn the day
Ne nyghtyngale  in the seson of May
Nas neuere man  that luste bet to synge
Ne lady  lustier in carolynge
Or for to speke of love and wommanhede
Ne knyght in Armes  to doon an hardy dede
To stonden in grace  of his lady deere
Than hadde this preest this soory craft to leere
And to the Chanon  thus he spak and seyde
ffor loue of god  that for vs alle deyde
And as I may  deserue it vnto yow
What shal this receite coste  telleth now
 By oure lady quod this Chanon  it is deere
I warne yow wel  for saue I and a frere
In Engelond  ther kan no man it make
 No fors quod he  now sire for goddes sake
What shal I paye  telleth me I preye
 Ywis quod he  it is ful deere I seye
  
Sire at o word  if that thee list it haue
Ye shul paye fourty pound  so god me saue
And nere the freendshipe  þat ye dide er this
To me  ye sholde paye moore ywis
 This preest the somme of fourty pound anon
Of nobles fette  and took hem euerichon
To this Chanon  for this ilke receit
Al his werkyng nas but fraude and deceit
 Sire preest he seyde  I kepe han no loos
Of my craft  for I wolde it kept were cloos
And as ye loue me  kepeth it secree
ffor and men knewen  al my soutiltee
By god  they wolden han so greet enuye
To me  by cause  of my Philosophye
I sholde be deed  ther were noon oother weye  
 God it forbeede quod the preest what sey ye
Yet hadde I leuere  spenden al the good
Which þat I haue  or elles wexe I wood
Than that ye sholden falle in swiche mescheef
 ffor youre good wyl  sire haue ye right good preef
Quod the Chanon  and farwel grant mercy
He wente his wey  and neuer the preest hym sy
After that day  and whan þat this preest shoolde
Maken assay  at swich tyme as he wolde
Of this receit  farwel  it wolde nat be
Lo thus byiaped  and bigiled was he
Thus maketh he  his introduccion
To brynge folk to  destruccion
COnsidereth sires  how þat in ech estaat
Bitwixe men and gold  ther is debaat
So ferforth  that vnnethe is ther noon
This multiplying blent so many oon
That in good feith  I trowe þat it bee
The cause grettest of swich scarsetee
Philosophres  speken so mystily
In this craft þat men kan nat come therby
  
ffor any wit þat men han now a dayes
They mowe wel chiteren  as þat doon Ioyes
And in hir termes  sette hir lust and peyne
But to hir purpos  shul they neuere atteyne
A man may lightly lerne  if he haue aught
To multiplie  and brynge his good to naught
 Lo  swich a lucre  is in this lusty game
A mannes myrthe  it wol turne vnto grame
And empten also  grete and heuye purses
And maken folk  for to purchacen curses
Of hem  þat han hir good  therto ylent
ffy for shame  they þat han been brent
Allas  kan they nat flee  the fires heete
Ye that it vse  I rede ye it leete
Lest ye lese al  for bet than neuere is late
Neuere to thryue  were to long a date
Though ye prolle ay  ye shul it neuere fynde
Ye been as boold as is Bayard the blynde
That blondreth forth  and peril casteth noon
He is as boold  to renne agayn a stoon
As for to goon  bisides in the weye
So faren ye  that multiplie I seye
If þat youre eyen  kan nat seen aright
Looke þat youre mynde  lakke noght his sight
ffor though ye looken neuer so brode and stare
Ye shul no thyng wynne on that chaffare
But wasten  al that ye  may rape and renne  
Withdraweth the fir  lest it to faste brenne
Medleth namoore  with that Art I mene
ffor if ye doon  youre thrift is goon ful clene
And right as swithe  I wol yow tellen heere
What þat the Philosophres seyn in this mateere
LO thus seith Arnold of the newe toun
As his Rosarie  maketh mencioun
He seith right thus  withouten any lye
Ther may no man  Mercurie mortifie
  
But it be  with his brother knowlechyng
How þat he  which þat first seyde this thyng
Of Philosophres  fader first was hermes
He seith  how þat the dragon doutelees
Ne dyeth nat but if that he be slayn
With his brother and that is for to sayn
By the dragon  Mercurie and noon oother
He vnderstood  and Brymstoon by his brother
That out of sol  and Luna were ydrawe
And therfore seyde he  taak heede to my sawe
Lat no man bisye hym  this Art for to seche
But if þat he  thentencion and speche
Of Philosophres  vnderstonde kan
And if he do  he is a lewed man
ffor this science  and this konnyng quod he
Is of the secree  of the secretes pardee
 Also  ther was a disciple of Plato
That on a tyme  seyde his maister to
As his book senior  wol bere witnesse
And this was his demande in soothfastnesse
Telle me the name  of the priuee stoon
 And Plato answerde  vnto hym anoon
Take the stoon  that Titanos men name
 Which is that quod he Magnasia is the same
Seyde Plato  ye sire  and is it thus
This is  ignotum per ignocius
What is Magnasia  good sire I yow preye
 It is a water  that is maad I seye
Of elementes foure quod Plato
 Telle me the roote  good sire quod he tho
Of that water  if it be youre wille
 Nay nay quod Plato  certein that I nylle
The Philosophres  sworn were euerychoon
That they  sholden discouere it vnto noon
Ne in no book it write  in no manere
ffor vnto Crist  it is so lief and deere
  
That he wol nat that it discouered bee
But where it liketh  to his deitee
Man for tenspire  and eek  for to deffende  
Whom þat hym liketh  lo this is the ende
 Thanne conclude I thus  sith þat god of heuene
Ne wil nat that the Philosophres neuene
How þat a man  shal come vnto this stoon
I rede vs for the beste  lete it goon
ffor who so  maketh god his Aduersarie
As for to werken  any thyng in contrarie
Of his wil  certes neuer shal he thryue
Thogh that he multiplie terme of lyue
And there a poynt for ended is my tale
God sende euery trewe man  boote of his bale Amen 
Woot ye nat  where ther stant a litel toun
Which þat ycleped is Bobbe up and doun
Vnder the Blee  in Caunterbury weye
Ther gan oure hoost for to Iape and pleye
And seyde sires  what Dun is in the Myre
Is ther no man  for preyere ne for hyre
That wole awake  oure felawe al bihynde
A theef  myghte hym ful lightly robbe and bynde
See how he nappeth  see how for Cokkes bones
As he wol falle  fro his hors atones
Is that a Cook of London  with meschance
Do hym come forth  he knoweth his penaunce
ffor he shal telle a tale  by my fey
Although  it be nat worth a Botel hey
Awake thou Cook quod he  god yeue thee sorwe
What eyleth thee  to slepe by the morwe
Hastow had fleen al nyght or artow dronke
Or hastow  with som quene  al nyght yswonke
So that thow mayst nat holden vp thyn heed
 This Cook  þat was ful pale and no thyng reed
Seyde to oure hoost so god my soule blesse
As ther is falle on me swich heuynesse
Noot I nat why þat me were leuere slepe
Than  the beste galon wyn in Chepe
  
 Wel quod the Maunciple  if it may doon ese
To thee sire Cook  and to no wight displese
Which þat heere rideth  in this compaignye
And that oure hoost wole of his curteisye
I wol now  excuse thee  of thy tale
ffor in good feith  thy visage is ful pale
Thyne eyen daswen eek as that me thynketh  
And wel I woot  thy breeth  ful soure stynketh
That sheweth wel  thou art nat wel disposed
Of me certeyn  thou shalt nat been yglosed
See how he ganeth  lo this dronken wight
As though he wolde  swolwe vs anonright
Hoold cloos thy mouth man  by thy fader kyn
The deuel of helle  sette his foot therIn
Thy cursed breeth  infecte wole vs alle
ffy stynkyng swyn  fy  foule moote thou falle
A taketh heede sires  of this lusty man
Now sweete sire  wol ye Iusten atte ffan
Therto me thynketh  ye been wel yshape
I trowe  that ye dronken han wyn Ape
And that is  whan men pleyen with a straw
And with this speche  the Cook wax wrooth and wraw
And on the Manciple  he gan nodde faste
ffor lakke of speche  and doun the hors hym caste
Where as he lay  til þat men vp hym took
This was  a fair chyuachee  of a Cook
Allas  he nadde  holde hym by his ladel
And er þat he  agayn were in his Sadel
Ther was greet showuyng bothe to and fro
To lifte hym vp  and muchel care and wo
So vnweeldy  was this sory palled goost
And to the Manciple  thanne spak oure hoost
 By cause  drynke  hath dominacion
Vpon this man  by my sauacion
I trowe  lewedly  he wolde telle his tale
ffor were it wyn  or oold  or moysty Ale
  
That he hath dronke  he speketh in his nose
And fneseth faste  and eek he hath the pose
 He hath also  to do moore than ynough
To kepen hym and his Capul out of slough
And if he falle  from his capul eftsoone
Thanne shal we alle  haue ynogh to doone
In liftyng vp  his heuy dronken cors
Telle on thy tale  of hym make I no fors
 But yet Manciple  in feith thou art to nyce
Thus openly  repreue hym of his vice
Another day  he wole perauenture
Reclayme thee  and brynge thee to lure
I meene  he speke wole  of smale thynges
As for to pynchen  at thy rekenynges
That were nat honeste  if it cam to preef 
 No quod the Manciple  that were a greet mescheef
So myghte he lightly  brynge me in the snare
Yet hadde I leuere  payen for the Mare
Which that he rit on  than he sholde with me stryue  
I wol nat wratthen hym  al so moot I thryue
That that I speke  I seyde it in my bourde
And wite ye what I haue heer in a gourde
A draghte of wyn  ye of a ripe grape
And right anon  ye shul seen a good Iape
This Cook shal drynke ther of  if þat I may
Vp peyne of deeth  he wol nat seye me nay
 And certeynly  to tellen as it was
Of this vessel  the Cook drank faste  allas
What neded hym  he drank ynough biforn
And whan he hadde  pouped in this horn
To the Manciple  he took the gourde agayn
And of that drynke  the Cook was wonder fayn
And thanked hym  in swich wise as he koude
 Thanne gan oure hoost to laughen wonder loude
And seyde  I se wel  it is necessarie
Where þat we goon  þat drynke we with vs carie
  
ffor that wol turne  rancour and disese
Tacord and loue  and many a wrong apese
 O Bacus  yblessed be thy name
That so kanst turnen  ernest into game
Worshipe and thank be to thy deitee
Of that mateere  ye gete namoore of me
Telle on thy tale  Manciple I thee preye
 Wel sire quod he  now herkneth what I seye

WHan Phebus  dwelled heere  in this world adoun
As olde bookes  maken mencioun
He was  the mooste lusty Bachiler
In al this world  and eek the beste Archer
He slow Phiton  the serpent as he lay
Slepynge  agayn the sonne vpon a day
And many another  noble worthy dede
He with his bowe wroghte  as men may rede
 Pleyen he koude  on euery Mynstralcie
And syngen  that it was a melodie
To heeren  of his cleere voys the soun
Certes  the kyng of Thebes Amphioun
That with his syngyng walled that Citee
Koude neuere syngen  half so wel as hee
Therto he was  the semelieste man
That is or was  sith þat the world bigan
What nedeth it hise fetures to discryue
ffor in this world  was noon so fair on lyue
He was therwith  fulfild of gentillesse  
Of honour  and of parfit worthynesse
 This Phebus  that was  flour of Bachilrie
As wel  in fredom  as in Chiualrie
ffor his desport in signe eek of Victorie
Of Phiton  so as telleth vs the storie
Was wont to beren in his hand a bowe
 Now hadde this Phebus  in his hous a crowe
Which in a Cage  he fostred many a day
And taughte it speke  as men teche a Iay
  
Whit was this Crowe  as a snow whit swan
And countrefete the speche of euery man
He koude  whan he sholde telle a tale
Therwith in al this world  no nyghtyngale
Ne koude  by an hondred thousand deel
Syngen  so wonder myrily and weel
 Now hadde this Phebus  in his hous a wyf 
Which þat he louede  moore than his lyf
And nyght and day  dide euere his diligence
Hir for to plese  and doon hire reuerence
Saue oonly  the sothe that I shal sayn
Ialous he was  and wolde haue kept hire fayn
ffor hym were looth  byiaped for to be
And so is euery wight in swich degree
But all in ydel  for it auailleth noght
A good wyf  that is clene  of werk and thoght
Sholde nat been kept in noon awayt certayn
And trewely  the labour is in vayn
To kepe a shrewe  for it wol nat bee
This holde I  for a verray nycetee
To spille labour  for to kepe wyues
Thus writen olde clerkes  in hir lyues
Bvt now to purpos  as I first bigan
This worthy Phebus  dooth all that he kan
To plesen hire  wenynge that swich plesance
And for his manhede  and his gouernance
That no man  sholde han put hym from hire grace
But god it woot ther may no man embrace
As to destreyne a thyng which þat nature
Hath natureelly  set in a creature
 Taak any bryd  and put it in a Cage
And do al thyn entente  and thy corage
To fostre it tendrely  with mete and drynke
Of alle deyntees  þat thou kanst bithynke
And keepe it al so clenly  as thou may
Al though his Cage  of gold be neuer so gay
  
Yet hath this brid  by twenty thousand foold
Leuere in a fforest  that is rude and coold
Goon ete wormes  and swich wrecchednesse  
ffor euere this brid  wol doon his bisynesse
To escape out of his Cage  if he may
His libertee  this brid desireth ay
 Lat take a Cat and fostre hym wel with Milk
And tendre flessh  and make his couche of silk
And lat hym seen  a Mous go by the wal
Anon he weyueth  Milk  and flessh and al
And euery deyntee  that is in that hous
Swich appetit he hath  to ete a Mous
Lo  heere hath lust his dominacion
And Appetit fleemeth discrecion
 A she wolf  hath also  a vileyns kynde
The lewedeste wolf  þat she may fynde
Or leest of reputacion  that wol she take
In tyme  whan hir lust to han a make
 Alle thise ensamples  speke I by thise men
That been vntrewe  and no thyng by wommen
ffor men han euere  a likerous appetit
On lower thyng to parfourne hire delit
Than on hire wyues  be they neuer so faire
Ne neuer so trewe  ne so debonaire
fflessh is so newefangel with meschaunce
That we ne konne  in no thyng han plesaunce
That sowneth into vertu  any while
 This Phebus  which þat thoghte vpon no gile
Deceyued was  for al his Iolitee
ffor vnder hym  another hadde shee
A man  of litel reputacion
Nat worth to Phebus  in comparison
The moore harm is  it happeth ofte so
Of which ther cometh  muchel harm and wo
 And so bifel  whan Phebus was absent
His wyf anon  hath for hir lemman sent
  
Hir lemman certes this is a knauyssh speche
fforyeueth it me  and that I yow biseche
 The wise Plato seith  as ye may rede
The word  moot nede accorde with the dede
If men shal telle proprely a thyng
The word  moot cosyn be to the werkyng
I am a boystous man  right thus seye I
Ther nys no difference trewely
Bitwixe a wyf þat is of heigh degree
If of hire body  dishoneste she bee
And a poure wenche  oother than this
If it so be  they werke bothe amys
But þat the gentile  in hire estaat aboue
She shal be cleped  his lady as in loue
And for that oother  is a poure womman  
She shal be cleped  his wenche  or his lemman
And god it woot myn owene deere brother
Men leyn þat oon  as lowe as lith þat oother
 Right so  bitwixe a titlelees tirant
And an Outlawe  or a theef errant
The same I seye  ther is no difference
To Alisaundre  was toold this sentence
That for the tirant is of gretter myght
By force of meynee  for to sleen doun right
And brennen hous and hoom  and make al playn
Lo  therfore  is he cleped a Capitayn
And for the Outlawe  hath but smal meynee
And may nat doon  so greet an harm as he
Ne brynge a contree  to so greet mescheef
Men clepen hym  an Outlawe  or a theef 
But for I am a man  noght textueel
I wol noght telle  of textes neuer a deel
I wol go  to my tale  as I bigan
Whan Phebus wyf  had sent for hir lemman
Anon they wroghten  al hire lust volage
 The white crowe  they heeng ay in the Cage
  
Biheeld hire werk and seyde neuer a word
And whan þat hoom was come Phebus the lord
This Crowe sang  Cokkow  Cokkow  Cokkow 
 What bryd quod Phebus  what song syngestow
Ne were thow wont so myrily to synge
That to myn herte  it was a reioysynge
To heere thy voys  allas what song is this
 By god quod he  I synge nat amys
Phebus quod he  for al thy worthynesse
ffor al thy beautee  and thy gentilesse
ffor al thy song and thy Mynstralcye
ffor al thy waityng blered is thyn eye
With oon  of litel reputacion
Noght worth to thee  in comparison
The montance of a gnat so moote I thryue
ffor on thy bed  thy wyf  I saugh hym swy and cetera
 What wol ye moore  the Crowe anon hym tolde
By sadde tokenes  and by wordes bolde
How þat his wyf had doon hire lecherye
Hym to greet shame  and to greet vileynye
And tolde hym ofte  he saugh it with hise eyen
 This Phebus  gan aweyward for to wryen
And thoughte  his sorweful herte brast atwo
His bowe he bente  and sette therInne a flo
And in his Ire  his wyf  thanne hath he slayn
This is theffect ther is namoore to sayn
ffor sorwe of which  he brak his Mynstralcie  
Bothe harpe  and lute  and Gyterne  and sautrie
And eek he brak hise Arwes  and his bowe
And after that thus spak he to the crowe
 Traitour quod he  with tonge of Scorpion
Thou hast me broght to my confusion
Allas that I was wroght  why nere I deed
O deere wyf o gemme of lustiheed
That were to me  so sad  and eek so trewe
Now listow deed  with face pale of hewe

O rakel hand  to doon so foule amys
O trouble wit o Ire recchelees
That vnauysed  smyteth giltles
O wantrust  ful of fals suspecion
Where was thy wit and thy discrecion
O euery man  be war of rakelnesse
Ne trowe no thyng withouten strong witnesse
Smyt nat to soone  er þat ye witen why
And beeth auysed  wel and sobrely
Er ye doon  any execucion
Vp on youre Ire  for suspecion
Allas  a thousand folk hath rakel Ire
ffully fordoon  and broght hem in the Mire
Allas  for sorwe I wol my seluen slee
 And to the Crowe  o false theef seyde he
I wol thee quite anon  thy false tale
Thou songe whilom  lyk a nyghtyngale
Now shaltow false theef thy song forgon
And eek thy white fetheres euerichon
Ne neuere in al thy lif ne shaltou speke
Thus shal men  on a traytour been awreke
Thou  and thyn ofspryng euere shul be blake
Ne neuere  sweete voys shul ye make
But euere crie  agayn tempest and rayn
In tokenynge  þat thurgh thee  my wyf is slayn
And to the Crowe  he stirte  and that anon
And pulled  hise white fetheres euerychon
And made hym blak and refte hym al his song
And eek his speche  and out at dore hym slong
Vnto the deuel  which I hym bitake
And for this caas  been alle Crowes blake
LOrdynges  by this ensample I yow preye
Beth war  and taketh kepe what I seye
Ne telleth neuere  no man in youre lyf
How þat another man  hath dight his wyf

Of thilke parfit glorious pilgrymage

And if ye vouche sauf  anon I shal
Bigynne vpon my tale  for which I preye

 But nathelees  this meditacion
I putte it ay  vnder correccion
Of Clerkes  for I am nat textueel

Therfore  I make a protestacion
That I wol stonde to correccion
  
 Vp on this word  we han assented soone

To enden  in som vertuous sentence
And for to yeue hym space and audience
And bede oure hoost he sholde to hym seye

 Oure hoost hadde the wordes for vs alle
Sire preest quod he  now faire yow bifalle
Sey what yow list and we wol gladly heere
And with that word  he seyde in this manere
Telleth quod he  youre meditacioun
But hasteth yow  the sonne wole adoun
Beth fructuous  and that in litel space
And to do wel  god sende yow his grace
But here of I wil passe as now  
And of ȝong Gamelyne I wil telle ȝow
THe tale of ȝong Gamelyn  
ithen and listenyth and herkenyth a right
And ȝe shul here of a doughti knyght
Sire Iohn of Bondys was his name
He coude of norture and of mochel game
Thre sones the knyght had and with his body hem wan
The eldest was a moche schrew and sone he bigan
His bretheren loued wel here fader and of him were agast
The eldest disserued his fader curs and h had hit at last
The gode knyght his fader lyued so ȝore
That deth was comyn him to and handlid him ful sore
The good knyght cared sore sike þer he lay
How his children shuld lyuen after his day
He had ben wide where but non husbonde he was
Al the londe that he hadde hit was purchas
ffayn he wold it were dressed among hem alle
That eche of hem hadd his part as it myght falle
Tho sente he in to contre after wyse knyghtes
To helpen delen his londes and dressen hem to rightes
He sent hem word by lettres þai shuld hye blyue
Ȝif thei wold speke with him while he was on lyue


Tho þe knyghtes herden syke þat he lay
Had þei no rest nother nyght no day
Til þei come to him þer he lay stille
On his deeþ bed to abide goddes wille
Then seide þe good knyght sike þer he lay
Lordes I ȝow warne for soth withoute nay
I may no lenger lyuen here in this stonde
ffor thorugh goddes wille deth drawes me to grounde
Ther nas none of hem alle þat herd hem a right
That thei hadden reuthe of þat ilke knyght
And seiden sire for goddes loue ne dismay ȝow nought
God may done bote of bale þat is now Iwroght
Than spake þe gode knyght sike þer he lay
Bot of bale god may send I wot it is no nay
But I byseke ȝow knyghtes for the loue of me
Goth and dresseth my londes among my sones thre
And for the loue of god delith not hem amys
And forȝeteþ not Gamelyn my ȝong sone þat is
Takiþ hide to that one as wel as to that other
Seeld ȝe seen any heier helpen his brother
Tho leten þei the knyght lyen þat was not in hele  
And wenten in to conseil his londis for to dele
ffor to delem hem alle to oon that was her þoght
And for Gamelyn was ȝongest he shuld haue noght
Alle the lond þat ther was þei dalten it in two
And leten Gamelyn þe ȝong withouten lond go
And eche of hem seide to oþer ful lowde
His breþrin might ȝeue him lond when he good cowde
When thei hadde deled the lond at her wille
Thei comen to þe knyght þer he lay stille
And told him anoon how thei had wroght
And the knyght ther he lay likid it right noght
Than saide the knyght by seynt martyn
ffor al þat ȝe haue don ȝet is þe lond myn
ffor goddes loue Neighboures stondith alle stil
And I wil delen my lond right after my wil


Iohn my eldest sone shal haue plowes fyue
That was my fadres heritage while he was on lyue
And my myddlest sone fyue plowes of lond
That I halpe for to gete wit my right hond
And alle myn oþer purchas of londes and ledes
Þat I bequethe Gamelyn and alle my gode stedes
And I beseke ȝow good men þat law con of lond
ffor Gamelyns loue þat my quest stond
Thus dalt þe knyght his lond by his day
Right on his deeth bed sike þer he lay
And sone afterward he lei stoon stille
And died whan tyme come as it was cristes wille
Anone as he was dede and vnder gras grave
Sone þe elder brother giled the ȝong knave
He toke in to his honde his lond and his lede
And Gamelyn him selue to clothen and to fede
He clothed him and fedde hym yuel and eke wrothe
And lete his londes forfare and his houses bothe
His parkes and his wodes and dide no thing welle
And sithen he it abowght on his owne felle
So long was Gamelyn in his brothres halle
ffor þe strengest of good wille þei douteden him alle
Ther was none therin noþer ȝong ne old
That wold wrath Gamelyn were he neuer so bold
Gamelyn stood on a day in his brotheris ȝerd
And bigan with his hand to hondel his berd
He þought on his landes þat lay vnsawe  
And his faire okes þat doune were Idrawe
His parkes were broken and his dere reved
Of alle his good stedes noon was him byleued
His howses were vnhiled and ful yuel dight
Thoo þouȝt Gamelyn it went not aright
Afterward came his brother walking there
And seide to gamelyn is oure mete ȝare
Tho wrathed him Gamelyn and swore by goddes booke
Thow shalt go bake thi self I wil not be thi cooke


Now broþer Gamelyn how answerist þow now
Thou spakest neuer suche a word as þow dost now
By my feith seide Gamelyn now me thinkith nede
Of alle þe harmes þat I haue I toke neuer ȝet hede
My parkes ben broken and my dere byreved
Of myn armes and my stedes noght is me byleued
Al þat my fader me biquaþ al goth to shame
And þerfore haue þou goddes curs brother by thyn name
Than spake his brother þat rape was of rees
Stand stille gadling and hold þi pees
Þou shalt be fayn to haue þi mete and þi wede
What spekest þou gadling of lond or of lede
Þan seide Gamelyn þe child þat ȝyng
Cristes curs mote he haue þat clepith me gadling
I am no worse gadlyng ne no worse wight
But borne of a lady and geten of a knyght
Ne dorst he note to Gamelin neuer a fote go
But clepid to him his men and seide to hem tho
Goth and betith this boy and reueth him his witte
And lete him lerne an other to answere me bette
Then saide þe child ȝong Gamelyn
Cristes curs mote þou haue brother art þou myn
And ȝif I shal algate be beten anoon
Cristes curs mote þou haue but þou be that oon
And anon his brother in þat grete hete
Made his men to fette staffes Gamelyn to bete
When euery of hem hadd a staff Inomen
Gamelyn was war þoo he seigh hem comen
Tho Gamelyn sighe hem comen he loked ouer all
And was warre of a pestel stood vnder þe walle
Gamelyn was light and þider con he lepe
And droff alle his brothers men right sone on hepe  
And lokid as a wild lyon and laide on gode wone
Tho his brother sei þat he bygan to gone
He fley vp in to a loft and shete þe dore faste
This Gamelyn with his pestel mad hem al agast


Some for gamelyns loue and some for eye
Alle thei drowhen hem to halues þoo he gan to pleye
What now seide Gamelyn euel mote ȝe thee
Wil ȝe bigynne contik and so sone flee
Gamelyn soght his broþer whider he was flow
And sauhe where he lokid oute at a wyndowe
Brother said Gamelyn come a litel nere
And I wil teche the a play at the bokelere
His brother hym answerid and seid by seint Richere
While þat pestel is in thi hond I wil come no nere
Brother I wil make thi pees I swere by cristes ore
Cast away þe pestel and wrathe the nomore
I moste nede saide Gamelyn wrath me at ones
ffor þou wold make þi men to breke my bones
Ne hadde I hadde mayn and might in myn armes
To haue hem fro me thei wold haue do me harmes
Gamelyn saide his brother be þou not wrothe
ffor to seen the haue harme me were right lothe
I ne did it noght broþer but for a fondyng
ffor to loken or þou art strong and art so ȝyng
Come adoune then to me and graunt me my bone
Of a thing I wil the axe and we shul saught sone
Down þan come his broþer that fykel was and felle
And was swith sore aferd of þe pestell
He saide brother Gamelyn axe me þi bone
And loke þou me blame but I it graunt sone
Than saide Gamelyn brother I was
And we shul be at one þou most graunt me this
Alle þat my fadir me byquaþ while þat he was on lyue
Thou most do me it haue ȝif we shul not stryve
Þat shat þou haue Gamelyn I swere by cristes ore
All þat þi fader þe biquath þough þou woldest haue more
Thi lond that lith leie wel it shal be sowe
And thyn houses reised vp þat ben leide ful lowe
Thus saide the knyght to Gamelyn with mouth
And þought on falsenes as he wel couthe


The knyght þought on treson and Gamelyn on none  
And went and kissed his brother and when þei were at one
Alas ȝong Gamelyn no thing he ne wiste
With suche false treson his brother him kyste
Lynthenyth and lysteneth and holdith ȝoure tong
And ȝe shul here talkyng of Gamelyn the ȝong
Ther was ther be siden cried a wrastelynge
And ther fore ther was sett a Ram and a Rynge
And Gamelyn was in wille to wende þerto
ffor to preuen his might what he coude do
Brother seide Gamelyn be seint Richere
Thou most lene me to nyght a litel cursere
That is fressh to þe spores on for to ride
I most on an Erand a litel here be side
Be god saide his brother of stedes in my stalle
Go and chese the þe best spare non of hem alle
Of stedes and of cursers that stoden hem be side
And telle me good brother whider þou wilt ride
Here be side brother is cried a wrastlynge
And þer fore shal be sette a ram and a rynge
Moche worship it were brother to vs alle
Might I þe ram and þe rynge bryngen home to þis halle
A stede þer was sadeled smertly and skete
Gamelyn dide a paire of spores faste on his fete
He sette his fote in þe stirop the stede he bystrod
And toward þe wrastlynge the yong child rood
Tho Gamelyn þe yonge was riden oute at gate
The fals knyght his brother loked yit after þate
And bisought ihesu crist that is heuen kynge
He mighte breke his nekke in that wrastlinge
As sone as Gamelyn come ther the place was
He light doun of his stede and stode on the gras
And ther he herde a frankelen weylaway synge
And bigan bitterly his handes for to wrynge
Gode man seide Gamelyn whi makest þou þis fare
Is ther no man that may ȝow helpen out of care


Allas seide þis frankeleyn that euer was I bore
ffor twei stalworth sones I wene that I haue lore
A Champion is in þe place þat hath wroght me sorowe
ffor he hath slayn my two sones but ȝif god hem borwe
I wol ȝeue ten pound by ihesu crist and more
With þe nones þat I fond a man to handle hym sore  
Gode man seide Gamelyn wilt þou wel done
Hold myn hors while my man drawith of my shone
And helpe my man to kepe my clothes and my stede
And I wil in to þe place gone to loke ȝif I may spede
By god seide þe frankeleyn it shal be done
I wil my self be thi man to draw of thi shone
And wende þou in to place ihesu criste the spede
And drede not of thi clothes ne of þi gode stede
Barfoot and vngirt Gamely In came
Alle þat were in þe place hede of him þei name
How he durste auntre him to done his myght
Þat was so doughti a champion in wrastling and in fight
Vp sterte þe Champion rapely anone
Toward ȝong Gamelyn he bygan to gone
And seide who is þi fader and who is þi sire
ffor sothe þou art a grete fool þat þou come here
Gamelyn answerid þe Champion tho
Thou knew wel my fader while he couthe go
Whiles he was on lyue by seint Martyn
Sire Iehan of Boundis was his name and I gamelyn
ffelaw seide þe Champion so mote I thyue
I knew wel þi fader whiles he was on lyue
And thi self gemelyn I wil þat þou it here
While þou were a ȝong boy a moche schrew þou were
Than seide Gamelyn and swore by cristes ore
Now I am older wax þou shalt fynde me a more
By god seide þe Champion wel come mote þou be
Come þou ones in my hond þou shalt neuer the
It was wel withInne the nyght and the mone shone
When Gamelyn and the Champion togedre gon gone


The Champion cast tornes to gamelyn þat was prest
And gamelyn stode and bade him done his best
Than seide Gamelyn to þe Champion
Thou art fast aboute to bryng me adoun
Now I haue proued mony tornes of thyne
Thou most he seide proue on or two of myne
Gamelyn to þe Champion ȝede smertely anone
Of alle the tornes þat he couthe he shewid him but one
And kest him on the lift side þat þe ribbes he brake
And þerto his one arme þat ȝaf a grete crak
Than seide gamelyn smertly anone  
Shal it be hold for a cast or elles for none
By god seide þe Champion wheþer it be
He þat cometh ones in thi honde shal he neuer the
Þan seide þe frankeleyn þat hadd his sones there
Blessed be þou Gamelyn þat euer þou bore were
The frankeleyn seide to þe Champion on hym stood hym no eye
This is ȝong Gamelyn þat taght þe this pleie
Aȝen vnswared þe Champion þat liked no þing wel
He is altther maister and his pleie is right felle
Sithen I wrastelet first it is gone ȝore
But I was neuer in my lif handeled so sore
Gamelyn stode in þe place anon without serke
And seid ȝif þer ben mo lete hem come to werke
The Champion þat payned hym to wirke sore
Hit semyth bi his continance þat he wil no more
Gamelyn in þe place stood stille as stoon
ffor to abyde wrastlinge but þer come none
Ther was noon with gamelyn þat wold wrastle more
ffor he handlid þe Champion so wonderly sore
Two gentil men ȝemed þe place
Come to Gamelyn god ȝyue him gode grace
And seide to him do on thi hosen and þi shone
ffor sothe at þis tyme þis faire is done
And þan seide Gamelyn so mote I wel fare
I haue not ȝet haluendel sold my ware


Tho seide the Champion so brok I my swere
He is a fool þat therof bieth þou sellest it so dere
Thoo seide the ffrankeleyn þat was in moche care
ffelaw he seid whi lakkest þou þis ware
By seynt Iame in Galys þat mony man hath soght
Ȝit is it to good chepe that þou hast bought
Tho þat wardeyns were of þat wrastlinge
Come and brought Gamelyn þe Ramme and þe rynge
    
    
    
And went with moche ioye home in þe mornynge
His brother seie wher he came with þe grete route
And bade shit þe gate and hold hym withoute
The porter of his lord was sore agaste
And sterte anon to þe gate and lokkid it faste
Now litheþ and listenythe boþe ȝong and old
And ȝe shul here gamyn of Gamelyn þe bold
Gamelyn come therto for to haue comyn In  
Than was it shet fast with a pyn
Than seide Gamelyn Porter vndo þe ȝate
ffor gode mannys sore stonde þer ate
Than answerid þe porter and sware by goddes berd
Thou ne shalt Gamelyn come in to þis ȝerde
Thou lixt seid Gamelyn so broke I my chyne
He smote the wiket with his foote and brake away the pyne
The porter sey tho it might ne better be
He sette foote on erthe and bygan to flee
By my fai seide gamelyn þat trauaile is lore
ffor I am on foote as light as þou haddest it swore
Gamelyn ouer toke þe porter and his tene wrake
And girt him in the nekke þat þe boon tobrake
And toke him by þat on arme and threw him in a welle
VijC fadame it was depe as I haue herd telle
Whan Gamelyn þe ȝong þus had plaied his plaie
Alle þat in þe ȝerde were drowen hem awaye


Þei dreden him ful sore for werke þat he wroghte
And for þe faire companye þat he þider broghte
Gamelyn ȝede to þe ȝate and lete it vp wide
He lete In alle þat gon wold or ride
And seide ȝe be welcome without any greue
ffor we wil be maisters here and axe no man leue
Ȝesterday I left seide ȝong Gamelyn
In my brother seler fyue tonn wyne
I wil not þis companye parten on twyne
And ȝe wil don after me while sope is þerIne
And ȝif my brother grucche or make foule chere
Other for spence of mete and drynk þat we spend here
I am oure Catour and bere oure Alther purse
He shal haue for his grucching seint marie curse
My broþer is a nygon I swere by cristes ore
And we wil spende largely þat he hath spared ȝore
And who þat make grucching þat we here dwelle
He shal to þe porter in to þe draw welle
Vij dayes and vij nyght Gamelyn held his fest
With moche solace was there and none chest
In a litel torret his brother ley steke
And sey hem wast his gode and dorst not speke
Erly in a mornyng on the viij day
The gestes come to Gamelyn and wold gon her way
Lordes seide Gamelyn wil ȝe so hye  
All þe wyn is not ȝet dronke so browke I myn eie
Gamelyn in his hert was ful woo
When his gestes toke her leue fro him forto go
He wold þe had dwelled lenger and þei saide nay
But bytaught gamelyn god and goode day
Thus made Gamelyn his fest and broght it wel to end
And after his gestes toke leue to wende
Litheþ and listenyth and holdith ȝoure tong
And ȝe shul here Gamen of Gamelyn þe ȝong
Herkenyth lordinges and listeneþ a right
When alle gestes were gon how Gamelyn was dight


Alle the while þat Gamelyn held his mangerie
His brother þought on him be wreke with his trecherie
Tho Gamelyns gestes were riden and goone
Gamelyn stode anone allone frend hadde he none
Tho after felle sone withIn a litul stonde
Gamelyn was taken and ful hard Ibonde
fforth come the false knyght out of þe solere
To gamelyn his brother he ȝede ful nere
And saide to gamelyn who made the so bolde
ffor to stroien my store of my housholde
Brother seide Gamelyn wrath the right noght
ffor it is mony day gone sith it was boght
ffor brother þou hast hade by seint Richere
Of xv plowes of lond þis sixtene ȝere
And of alle þe bestes þou hast forþ bredde
Þat my fader me byquaþ on his deþ bedde
Of alle þis sixtene ȝere I ȝeue the þe prowe
ffor the mete and the drinke þat we haue spended now
Than saide þe false knyght euyl mote he the
Herken brother Gamelyn what I wil ȝeue the
ffor of my body brother heire geten haue I none
I wil make þe myn eyer I swere by seint Iohan
Parfay seide gamelyn and it so be
And þou þinkest as þu seist god ȝeld it the
No thing wist Gamelyn of his brother gile
Ther fore he him bygiled in a litul while
Gamelyn seid he oo þing I the telle
Tho þou threw my porter in the draw welle
I swore in þat wrath and in þat grete moote
That þou shuldest be bonde both hond and foote  
    
    
    
ffor to holden myn avow as I the byhoote
Brother seide Gamelyn as mote I the
Þou shalt not be forswore for þe loue of me


Tho maden thei Gamelyn to sitte myght not stonde
Til þei hadd him bond boþe foote and honde
The fals knyght his brother of Gamelyn was agast
And sent after feteres to feteren him fast
His brother made lesinges on him þere he stode
And told hem þat comen In þat Gamelyn was wood
Gamelyn stood to a post bonden in þe halle
Tho þat comen In loked on him alle
Euere stode gamelyn euen vp right
But mete ne drinke had he none noþer day ne nyght
Than saide gamelyn brother by myn hals
Now I haue aspied þou art a parti fals
Hadde I wiste þe treson þat þou hast Ifond
I wolde haue ȝeue strokes or I had be bond
Gamelyn stode bond stille as any stone
Two daies and two nyghtes mete hadde he none
Than saide gamelyn þat stod Ibond strong
Adam spenser me þinkeþ I fast to long
Adam spencer now I beseche the
ffor the moche loue my fader loued the
Ȝif þou may come to the keys lose me out of bond
And I wil parte with the of my fre lond
Þen saide adam þat was þe spencer
I haue serued thi brother þis xvj ȝere
Ȝif I lete the gon out of his beure
He wold say afterward I were a traitour
Adam seide Gamelyn so browke I myn hals
Thou shal fynd my brother atte þe last fals
Therfore brother Adam lose me out of bondes
And I wil parte with þe of my fre landes
Vp suche forward seid Adam Iwis
I wil do þerto alle þat in me is
Adam seide Gamelyn as mote I the
I wil holde þe couenaunt and þou wil me
Anone as Adame lord to bed was gone
Adam toke þe keys and lete gamelyn out anone


He vnlokked gamelyn both hondes and feete
In hope of auauncement þat he him byhete  
Than saide Gamelyn þanked be goddes sonde
Now I am lose bothe fote and honde
Hadde I now eten and dronken aright
Ther is none in this hous shuld bynde me þis nyght
Adam toke Gamelyn as stille as any stone
And lad him into spence raply anone
And sette him to soper right in a priue stede
He bade him do gladly and Adam so dede
Anon as Gamelyn hadde eten wel and fyne
And þerto Idronken wel of þe red wyne
Adam seid Gamelyn what is now þi rede
Or I go to my brother and gird of his hede
Gamelyn seide Adam it shal not be so
I con teche þe a rede þat is worth þe two
I wote wel for sothe þat is no nay
We shul haue a mangerie right on sonday
Abbotes and prioures mony here shal be
And oþer men of holy chirche as I telle 
Þou shalt stond vp by the post as þou were hond fast
And I schal leue hem vnloke þat away þou may hem cast
Whan þat þei haue eten and wasshen her hondes
Þow shalt beseke hem alle to bring þe out of bondes
And ȝif þei wil borow the þat were gode game
Þan were þu out of prison and I oute of blame
And yf eche of hem say to vs nay
I shal do an other I swere bi þis day
Thow shalt haue a gode staf and I wil haue anoþer
And cristes curs haue þat oon þat faileþ þat oþer
Ȝe for god seide Gamelyn I sei it for me
If I faile on my syde yuel mote I the
Ȝif we shul algate assoile hem of her synne
Warne me brother Adam whan we schul bygynn
Gamelyn said Adam by seint charite
I wil warne the byforne whan it shal be


Whan I wynke on the loke for to gone
And cast away þi ffetres and come to me anone
Adam saide Gamelyn blessid be thi bones
Þat is a good conseil ȝeuen for þe nones
Ȝif þei werne me to bring out of bondes
I wil sette good strokes right on her lendes
Tho þe sonday was comen and folke to þe feste  
ffaire þei were welcomed both lest and meste
And euere as þei at halle dore come Inne
Thei cast here eyȝe on ȝong Gamelyne
The fals knyght his broþer ful of trechery
Alle þe gestes þat þere were at þe mangery
Of Gamelyn his brother he told hem with mouthe
Alle þe harme and þe shame þat he telle couthe
Tho þei were Iserued of messes two or thre
Than seide Gamelyn how serue ȝe me
It is noght wel serued by god þat all made
Þat I sitte fasting and oþer men make glade
The fals knyght his brother þer as he stode
Tolde alle gestes þat Gamelyn was woode
And Gamelyn stode stille and answarid noght
But Adams wordes he held in his thoght
Tho Gamelyn gan speke deolfulli with alle
To þe grete lordes þat saten in þe halle
Lordes he seide for cristes passion
Helpe to bring Gamelyn out of prison
Than saide an Abbot sorow on his cheke
He shal haue cristes curs and seint maries eke
Þat þe out of pryson beggeþ or borwe
But euer worth him wel þat doth the moche sorwe
After þat Abbot þan spake anoþer
I wold þyn heed were of þoghe þou were my broþer
Alle þat þe borwe foul mote hem falle
Thus þei saide alle þat were in the halle
Than saide a Priour euel mote he preue
It is grete sorw and care boy þou art on lyue


Ow seid Gamelyn so browke I my bone
Now I haue spied þat frendes haue I none
Cursed mote he worth both flesshe and blood
Þat euer doþ priour or Abbot any good
Adam þe spencer toke vp þe clothe
And loked on Gamelyn and say þat he was wrothe
Adam on the pantrie litul he þoght
But two gode staues to halle dore he broght
Adam loked on Gamelyn and he was war anone
And cast away the fetres and bigan to gone
Tho he cam to Adam he toke þe on staf
And bygan to worche and good strokes ȝaf  
Gamelyn come in to þe halle and the spencer bothe
And lokid hem aboute as þei hadde ben wrothe
Gamelyn spreynyþ holi water with an Oken spire
That some that stod vp right fel in þe fire
Þer was no lewed man þat in þe halle stoode
That wold do Gamelyn any thing but goode
But stoden by siden and lete hem bothe wirche
ffor þei hadde ne reweth of men of holy chirche
Abbot or priour Monk or chanoun
That Gamelyn ouertoke anone þei ȝeden doun
Ther was none of alle þat with his staf mette
Þat he made hem ouer throw and quite hem his dette
Gamelyn said Adam for seint charite
Pay gode lyueray for þe loue of me
And I wil kepe þe dore so euer here I masse
Er þai ben assoiled þer shal none passe
Doute the noght seide Gamelyn while we ben in fere
Kepe wel þe dore and I wil wirche here
Bistere þe gode Adam and let þer non fle
And we shul telle largeli how mony þat þer be
Gamelyn saide Adam do hem but goode
Thei ben men of holi chirche draw of hem no blood
Saue wel þe crowne and do hem no harmes
But breke bothe her legges and sithen her armes


Thus Gamelyn and Adam wroght right fast
And plaide with the monkes and made hem agast
Thider þei come riding Ioly with swaynes
And home aȝeyn þei were lad in cartes and waynes
Tho þei hadden alle Idoo þen seide a gray frere
Alas sire Abbot what did we now here
Tho þat we comen hider it was a cold reede
Vs hadde ben better at home with water and with brede
While Gamelyn made ordres of monkes and frere
Euer stode his brother and made foul chere
Gamelyn vp with his staff þat he wel knew
And girt him in þe nek þat he ouer threw
A litil aboue þe gyrdel þe rigge bon tobrast
And sette him in þe fetres þer he sat arst
Sitte þer brother seide Gamelyn
ffor to colen þi body as I did myn
As sucche as þei hadden wroken hem on her foon  
Thei askid water and wasshen anone
What some for here loue and somme for her awe
Alle þe seruauntes seruet hem of the beste lawe
The sherreue was þenne but fyue myle
And alle was told him in a litil while
How gamelyn and Adam haden don a sory res
Bounden and wounden men aȝens the kynges pees
Tho bygan sone strif for to wake
And the sherrif aboute Gamelyn forto take
Now litheþ and listeneþ so god ȝeue ȝow good fyne
And ȝe shul here gode game of ȝong Gamelyn

Come to þe shirreue and seide þat þei wolde

The shirreue ȝeue hem leue soth for to say
Thei hyeden fast wold þei not lynne
Til þei come to þe gate þer Gamelyn was Inne
Thei knokkeden on þe gate þe porter was nyghe
And loked out at an hole as man that was slighe


The porter hadde behold hem a litil while
He loued wel Gamelyn and was drad of gile
And let þe wyket stond ful stille
And asked hem with oute what was here wille

Vndo þe gate porter and lete vs in gone
Than saide þe porter so brouke I my chyn

And I wend to Gamelyn to wyte his wille

And saide sire I warne ȝow here be comen ȝoure foon

Hit ben þe Shirreues men þat hider ben comen

Gamelyn said Adam hye the right blyue
And if I faile the þis day euel mote I thryue
And we shul so welcome þe Shirreues men
That some of hem shal make her beddes in þe fen
At a posterne gate Gamelyn out went
And a good Cartstaf in his hond hent
Adam hente sone an other grete staf
ffor to helpen Gamelyn and good strokes ȝaf
Adam fel tweyne and Gamelyn fel thre
The other sette feete on erth and bygan to flee
What saide Adam so euer here I masse
I haue right good wyn drynke or ȝe passe


Nay by god seide þei þi drinke is not goode
It wold make mannes brayn to lien in his hoode
Gamelyn stood stille and lokid him aboute
And saide þe shirreue cometh with a grete route
Adam seide Gamelyn what ben now þi redes
Here cometh þe sherreue and wil haue oure hedes
Adam seide to Gamelyn myn rede is now þis
Abide we no lenger lest we fare amys
I rede þat we to wood gone or þat we be fonde
Better is þer louse þan in towne be bounde
Adam toke bi the hond ȝong gamelyn
And euery of hem drank a draght of wyn
And after token her cours and wenten her way
Tho fond þe sherreue nyst but none eye
The sherreue light doune and wente in to halle
And fond þe lord fetred fast with alle
The shirreue vnfetered him right sone anone
And sent after a leche to hele his rigge bone
Late we now þe fals knyght lie in his care
And take we of Gamelyn and loke how he fare
Gamelyn in to þe wood stalkid stille
And Adam spencer liked right ille
Adam swore to Gamelyn by seint Richere
Now I see it is mery to be a spencer
That leuer me were keys to bere
Than walken in þis wild woode my clothes to tere
Adam seide Gamelyn dismay þe right noght  
Mony good mannys child in care is broght
As thei stod talkyng bothen in ffere
Adam herd talking of men and nyghe him þought þei were
Tho Gamelyn vnder wood lokid aright
Seuen score of ȝong men he se wel Idight
Alle sate at þe mete compas aboute
Adam seide Gamelyn now haue I no doute
After bale cometh bote þorgh goddes might
Me thinke of mete and drinke y haue a sight


Adam loke tho vnder wode bough
And tho he say mete and he was glad Inough
ffor he hoped to god to haue his dele
And he was sore alonged after a gode mele
As he saide þat word þe maister outlawe
Sawgh Adam and Gamelyn vnder wode shawe
Ȝonge men saide þe maister bi þe gode rode
I am war of gestes god send vs gode
Yonde ben two yonge men wel Idight
And parauenture ther ben more who so loked aright
Ariseth vp yong men and fette hem to me

Vp þer sterten seuene fro þe dyner
And metten wiþ gamelyn and Adam spencer
Whan thei were nighe hem þan seide þat one
Yeldeth vp ȝonge men ȝoure bowes and ȝoure flone
Than saide Gamelyn that ȝonge was of elde
Moche sorowe mote þei haue at to ȝow hem ȝelde

Thei ȝe fette to ȝow fyue þan be ȝe twelue
Þo þei herde by his word that might was in his arme
Ther was none of hem þat wolde don hem harme
But seide to Gamelyn myldely and stille
Come afore oure maistre and sai to him þi wille
Ȝonge men saide Gamelyn bi ȝoure lewte
What man is ȝour maister that ȝe with be

Oure maister is crowned of outlawes kynge
Adam seide Gamelyn go we in cristes name
He may neither mete ne drinke werne vs for shame
Ȝif þat he be hende and come of gentil blood
He wil ȝeue vs mete and drinke and do vs some good  
Be seint Iame saide Adam what harme þat I gete
I wil auenture me þat I hadde mete
Gamelyn and Adam went forth in fere
And þei grette þe maister that þei fonde þere


Than saide þe maister kynge of owtlawes
What seke ȝe ȝonge men vnder wode shawes
Gamelyn answerde þe kynge with his crowne
He moste nedes walke in felde þat may not walke in towne
Sire we walke not here none harne to do
But ȝif we mete a dere to shete þerto
As men that ben hungry and mow no mete fynde
And ben hard bestad vnder wode lynde
Of Gamelyn wordes þe maister hadde rewthe
And seide ȝe shal haue ynowe haue god my treuthe
He bad hem sitte down for to take reste
And bad hem ete and drinke and þat of þe beste
As þei eten and dronken wel and fyne
Than saide on to an other this is gamelyn
Tho was þe maister outlawe in to conseil nome
And tolde how it was gamelyn that thider was come
Anone as he herde how it was befalle
He made him maister vndir him ouer hem alle
Within þe thridde wike him come tydynge
To þe maister outlawe that was here kynge
That he shulde come home his pees was made
And of þat gode tydinge he was ful gladde
Tho saide he to his ȝonge men soth forto telle
Me ben comen tydinges I may no lenger dwelle
Tho was Gamelyn anone withoute tarienge
Made maister outlawe and crowned her kynge
Tho was Gamelyn crowned kynge of outlawes
And walkid a while vnder wode shawes
The fals knyght his broþer was shereue and sire
And lete his brother endite for hate and for hire
Tho were his bonde men sory and no thinge glad
When Gamelyn her lorde wolfes hede was cried and made
And sent oute of his men where þei might him fynde
ffor to go seke Gamelyn vnder wode lynde
To telle him tydinge the wynde was went
And alle his good reued and alle his men shent


Whan þei had den him founden on knees þei hem setten  
And adoun with her hode and here lorde gretten
Sire wrathe ȝowe noght for þe gode rode
ffor we han brought ȝow tydynge but þei be not goode
Now is þi brother sherreue and haþ þe baillie
And hath endited þe and wolfes hede doth þe crie
Allas seide Gamelyn þat euer I was so slak
That I ne hadde broke his nekke þo I his rigge brak
Goth greteth wel myn housbondes and wife
I wil be at the next shire haue god my lyfe
Gamelyn came redy to þe next shire
And ther was his brother both lorde and sire
Gamelyn boldeliche came in to þe mote halle
And putte adoun his hood amonge þe lordes alle
God saue ȝow lordinges þat here be
But broke bak sherreue euel mote thu the
Whi hast thou do me þat shame and velonye
ffor to lete endite me and wolfeshede do me crie
Tho thought the fals knyght for to ben awreke
And lete Gamelyn most he no thinge speke
Might þer be no grace but Gamelyn at þe laste
Was caste in prison and fetered faste
Gamelyn hath a brother that hight sire Ote
As gode a knyght and hende as might gon on foote
Anone ȝede a messagere to that gode knyght
And tolde him al togidre how Gamelyn was dight
    
He was right sory was he no þing light
And lete sadle a stede and þe way he name
And to his twei breþerne right sone he came
Sire saide sir Ote to the sherreue tho
We ben but thre bretheren shul we neuer be mo
And þou hast prisoned þe beste of vs alle
Suche a nother brother euel mote him befalle
Sire ote saide þe fals knyght lat be þi cours
By god for thi wordes he shal fare the wors


To þe kynges prisone he is Inome
And ther he shal abide til þe Iustice come
Parde saide sir Ote better it shal be
I bid hym to mainprys þat þou graunte me
Til þe next sitting of deliueraunce
And late þan Gamelyn stond to his chaunce
Brother in suche a forward I take him to the  
And by þi fadres soule þat þe bygat and me
But he be redy whan þe Iustice sitte
Thou shalt bere þe Iugement for al þi grete witte
I graunt wel saide sir Ote þat it so be
Late delyuer hym anone and take him to me
Tho was Gamelin delyuered to sir Ote his brother
And þat nyght dwelled þe oon with þe tother
On the morwen saide Gamelyn to sir Ote þe hynde
Brother he saide I mote for soth fro ȝow wynde
To loke how my ȝonge men leden her lif
Whether þei lyuen in Ioy or elles in strif
By god seide sir Ote þat is a cold rede
Now I see þat alle þe Carke schal falle on my hede
ffor whan þe Iustice sitte and þou be not Ifonde
I shal anone be take and in þi stede Ibonde
Brother saide Gamelyn dismaie þe nyght
ffor by seint Iame in Galys þat mony man hath sought
Ȝif þat god almyghti hold me my lif and my witte
I wil be redy whan þe Iustice sitte
Than saide sir Ote to Gamelyn god shild þe fro shame
Come when þou seest tyme and bryng vs out of blame
Litheþ and listeneþ and hold ȝow stille
And ȝe schul here how Gamelyn hadde his wille
Gamelyn went vnder wood Rys
And fond ther playng ȝong men of prys
Tho was ȝong Gamelyn right glad Inoghe
When he fonde his men vnder woode boghe
Gamelyn and his men talkeden in fere
And þei had gode game her maister to here


His men told him of auentures þat þei had fonde
And Gamelyn hem told hem aȝen how he was fast bonde
While Gamelyn was outlaw hade he no cors
Þer was no man þat for him ferd þe wors
But Abbotes and Priours monk and Chanon
On hem left he noght when he might hem nome
While Gamelyn and his men made myrthes Ryve
The fals knyght his brother euel mote he priue
ffor he was fast aboute bothe day and other
ffor to hire þe queste to hangen his brother
Gamelyn stood on a day and bebeld
The wodes and þe shawes and þe wild feld  
He þoght on his brother how he him byhette
That he wolde be redy whan þe Iustice sette
He þoght welle he wold withoute delay
Come afore þe Iustice to kepen his day
And seide to his ȝong men dighteþ ȝow ȝare
ffor whan þe Iustice sitte we most be þere
ffor I am vnder borow til þat I come
And my brother for me to pryson shal be nome
Be seint Iame said his ȝong men and þou rede þerto
Ordeigne how it shal be and it shal be do
While Gamelyn was comyng þer þe Iustice satte
The fals knyght his broþer forȝate he not þate
To hire þe men on his quest to hangen his brother
Thoghe þei hadde not þe oon þei wolde haue þe tother
Tho come Gamelyn fro vnder þe wode Rys
And broght with him ȝong men of prys
I see wel seide Gamelyn þe Iustice is sette
Goo aforn Adam and loke how it spette
Adam went in to þe halle and loked all aboute
He say þer stonde lordes grete and stoute
And sir Ote his brother fetered ful faste
Tho wente Adam oute of halle as he were agast
Adam seide to Gamelyn and to his felawes alle
Sire Ote stant fetered in þe mote halle


    
    
Ȝif god ȝif vs grace wel for to doo
He schal it abigge þat it broght þertoo
Than saide Adam þat lokkes hade hore
Cristes curs mote he haue þat him bond so sore
And þou wilt Gamelyn do after my rede
Ther is none in þe halle schal bere away his hede
Adam seide Gamelyn we wil not do soo
We wil sle þe giltif and late þe tother goo
I wil in to þe halle and with þe Iustice speke
On hem þat ben giltif I wil ben awreke
Lete none scape at þe dore take ȝong men ȝeme
ffor I wil be Iustice þis day domes to deme
God spede me þis day at my new werke
Adam come with me for þou shalt be my clerk
His men answerden him and bade him don his best
And ȝif þou to vs haue nede þou shalt fynde vs prest
We wille stond with þe while þat we may dure  
And bute we wirken manly pay vs none hure
Ȝong men saide Gamelyn so mote I wel the
As trusti a mayster ȝe shal fynde me
Right þere þe Iustice satte in þe halle
In went Gamelyn amonges hem alle
Gamelyn lete vnfetere his brother out of bond
Then seide sir Ote his brother þat was hende
Thou haddest Almost Gamelyn dwellet to long
ffor þe quest is oute on me þat I shuld hong
Brother seide Gamelyn so god ȝeue me good rest
Þis day þe shul ben honged þat ben on þe quest
And the Iustice bothe þat is þe Iuge man
And the Shirreue bothe þorgh him it bygan
Than saide Gamelyn to þe Iustice
Now is þi power done þou moste nedes rise
Thou hast ȝeuen domes þat ben yuel dight
I wille sitten in thi sete and dressen hem aright


The Iustice sate stille and rose not anone
And Gamelyn cleued his chike bone
Gamelyn toke him in his armes and nomore spake
But thrw him ouer þe barre and his arme brake
Dorst none to Gamelyn say but goode
ffor ferd of þe company þat withoute stoode
Gamely sette him down in þe Iustice sete
And sir Ote his brother by him and Adam at his fete
Whan Gamelyn was sette in þe Iustice sete
Herken of a bourd þat Gamelyn dide
He lete feter þe Iustice and his fals brother
And lete hem come to þe barre þat on with þat other
Tho Gamelyn hadde þus ydone hade no rest
Til he hadde enquered who was on þe quest
ffor to demen his brother sir Ote for to hong
Er he wiste whiche þei were him þoght ful long
But as sone as Gamelyn wiste where þai were
He dide hem euerychon feter in fere
And bringen hem to þe barre and setten hem in rew
Bi my feith said þe Iustice þe shirreue is a shrew
Than seide Gamelyn to þe Iustice
Thow hast ȝeue domes of the worst assise
And the xij sisoures þat weren on þe quest
Thei shul ben honged þis day so haue I gode rest  
Than saide þe shirreue to ȝong Gamelyn
Lord I cry the mercy brother art þou myn
Therfore saide Gamelyn haue þou cristes curs
ffor and þou were maister ȝit shuld I haue wors
ffor to make short tale and noght to long
He ordeyned hym a quest of his men so strong
The Iustice and þe shirreue both honged hye
To weyuen with þe ropes and þe wynd drye
And the xij sisours sorow haue þat rewe
Alle þei were hanged fast by þe nekke
Thus endid þe fals knyght with his trecherie
Þat euer had lad his lif in falsenes and folie


He was honged by þe nekke and not by þe purs
Þat was þe mede þat he hadde for his faders curse
Sire Otes was eldest and Gamelyn was ȝong
Wenten to her frendes and passeden to þe kyng
Thei maden pees with the kyng of þe best sise
The kyng loued wel sir Ote and made him Iustice
And after þe kyng made Gamelyn in Est and in Weste
Chief Iustice of his fre foreste
Alle his wight ȝong men þe kyng forȝaf her gilt
And sithen in gode Office þe kyng hath alle them pilt
Thus wanne Gamelyn his lond and his lede
And wreke him on his enemys and quite hem her mede
And sire Ote his brother made him his heier
And sithen wedden Gamelyn a wif gode and faier
Thei lyueden togedre while þat crist wolde
And sithen was Gamelyn grauen vnder molde
And so shal we alle may þer no man fle
God bring vs to þe Ioye þat euer shal be

OVre Ost vppon his stiropes  stood anoon

We leuen alle  in the grete god quod he

Iblissed be thy breche  and euery ston

But by my trouthe  if þou were seculer
Thow woldest ben a tredfoul  a right

The were nede of hennes  as I wene

So gret a nekke  and swich a large breest
He loketh as a sparhauke  with hise eyen
Him nedeth nat  his colour for to dyghen
With brasile  ne with greyn of Portyngale
Now sire  faire falle ȝow  for ȝoure tale
And after that  he with ful merie chere
Seide vnto a nother  as ȝe shuln heere
